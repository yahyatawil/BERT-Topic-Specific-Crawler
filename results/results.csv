When Freedman couldn't find a computer dictionary that would meaningfully augment the computer literacy classes he taught to Fortune 500 companies he set out on a quest to purchase his first computer and write this ""glaringly missing"" reference. The year 1980 was explosive for personal computers and buzzwords were everywhere. Self-published with 300-terms The Computer Glossary was a huge success in hundreds of seminars. Within a few years writing the dictionary became a full-time job 300 entries grew to more than 25 000 cross references. Along the way we have been known by Although Freedman writes all the definitions many outstanding professionals have provided technical assistance. Every major company in the industry has contributed and continues to do so. Channeled into print by one person the Encyclopedia is a collaboration of the best minds in the field. The company began in a New York loft near Penn Station. In 1985 Alan and Irma migrated to beautiful Bucks County Pennsylvania where they hand built the house they live and work in. They have four children and three grandchildren. Alan Freedman started out when computers were fed with punch cards. Shown here running an IBM sorter he learned data processing the hard way! Our last floppy was in 1995... our last books were in 2001 and our last CD was 2009. We were happy to eliminate floppies and CDs but after 20 years of creating books we can't help but feel a bit sad because nothing is as readable as print. However the cost of paper and the rapid changes in this field make it impossible to keep up-to-date in print. In addition the many translations into Spanish Hebrew and Korean took even more time.

Little is known of her life apart from her piety popularity with men and women followers of the Sufi path and her refusal to marry. The birth and death dates given for her are only approximate. She was orphaned then sold as a slave in her youth then set free by her Master to practice devotion and to engage in prayer. Many stories of her life were later told by . She is associated in legend with Hassan of Basri as his pupil or even as his teacher although it is unlikely that they met since he died in 728 when she was still a child. The numerous stories of her piety of people and of her life-style attest to the significance of her life in the story of the development of mystical Islam. Among women perhaps only the wives of known as mothers of the believers occupy so honored a place in the hearts of Muslims around the world. Rabi'a' and the Issue of Gender Her reputation excels that of many Muslim men within the early days of Sufism; she ""belongs to that elect company of Sufi women who have surpassed most of the contemporary masters of their time in wayfaring to God."" She has been described as symbolizing ""saintliness among women Sufis."" which she is widely credited as pioneering triumphed over other expressions that feared God rather than adored the divine. She was a teacher of men as well as of women a women who called no man her master indeed whose surrender to God was so complete that she placed all her trust in God to ensure that she was fed and clothed. Her devotion to God was so intense that relatively few solid facts about her life survived except that it was lived in complete and loving surrender to God which is the Islamic path. She was born between 95 and 99 Hijri in Basra . Much of her early life is narrated by Farid al-Din Attar. Many spiritual stories are associated with her and it is sometimes difficult to separate reality from legend. These traditions come from Farid al-Din Attar a later sufi saint and poet who used earlier sources. He is believed to have possessed a lost monograph on ""her life and acts"". Rabia herself did not leave any written works. She was the fourth daughter of her family and therefore named Rabia meaning ""fourth."" She was born free in a poor but respected family. According to Nurbakhsh her family could trace its lineage back to Noah. Rabia's parents were so poor that there was no oil in house to light a lamp nor a cloth even to wrap her with. Her mother asked her husband to borrow some oil from a neighbor but he had resolved in his life never to ask for anything from anyone except the Creator. He pretended to go to the neighbor's door and returned home empty-handed. appeared to him in a dream and told him: Your newly born daughter is a favorite of the Lord to the right path. You should approach the Amir of Basra and present him with a letter in which should be written this message: ""You offer Durood to the Holy Prophet one hundred times every night and four hundred times every Thursday night. However since you failed to observe the rule last Thursday as a penalty you must pay the bearer four hundred dinars."" Rabia's father got up and went straight to the Amir with tears of joy rolling down his cheeks. The Amir was delighted on receiving the message knowing that he was in the eyes of Prophet. He distributed 1000 dinars to the poor and joyously paid 400 dinars to Rabia's father. The Amir then asked Rabia's father to come to him whenever he required anything as the Amir would benefit very much by the visit of such a soul dear to the Lord. After the death of her father a Basra experienced a famine. Separated from her sisters legend has it that Rabia was accompanying a caravan which fell into the hands of robbers. The chief of the robbers took Rabia captive and sold her in the market as a slave. Her ""purchaser put her to hard labor."" She would pass the whole night in prayer after she had finished her household jobs. She spent many of her days observing a fast. Once the master of the house got up in the middle of the night and was attracted by the pathetic voice in which Rabia was praying to her Lord. She was entreating in these terms: Thous knowest that the desire of my heart is to obey Thee and that the light of my eye is in the service of Thy court. If the matter rested with me I should not cease for one hour from Thy service but Thou hast made me subject to a creature"" At once the master felt that it was sacrilegious to keep such a saint in his service. He decided to serve her instead. In the morning he called her and told her his decision; he would serve her and she should dwell there as the mistress of the house. If she insisted on leaving the house he was willing to free her from She told him that she was willing to leave the house to carry on her worship in solitude. The master granted this and she left the house. Rabia went into the desert to pray spending some time at a Sufi hermitage. She then began what according to Farīd al-Dīn was a seven year walk (some accounts describe her as crawling on her stomach) to as she approached the Ka'bah which made her unclean and unable to continue that day. Farīd al-Dīn uses this as lesson that even such a great saint as Rabia was ""hindered on the way."" Another story has the Ka'bah coming to greet her even as she persevered in her journey yet she ignored it since her desire was for the ""House of the Lord"" alone ""I pay no attention to the Ka'bah and enjoy not its beauty. My only desire is to encounter Him who said 'Whosoever approaches Me by a span I will approach him by a cubit'."" It is unclear whether Rabia received formal instruction in the Sufi way. Legend persistently associates her with Hasan of Basra although their probable chronologies make this impossible. Hasan is sometimes described as her master although other stories suggest that her station along the path was more advanced. For example: she was seen running through the streets of Basra carrying a torch in one hand and a bucket of water in the other. When asked what she was doing “when you are showing off your spiritual goods in this worldly market it should be things that your fellow-men are incapable of displaying.” And she flung her prayer rug into the air and flew up on it. “Come up here where people can see us!” she cried. Hasan who had not attained that station said nothing. Rabe’a sought to console him. “Hasan “what you did fishes also do and what I did flies also do. The real business is outside both these tricks. One must apply one’s self to the real business.” El Sakkakini suggests that it would have been from Sufi circles in Basra that Rabia received instruction; It is also likely that Rabia in her first encounter with Sufi circles at an early age at type of reed pipe or flute. This type of music was an integral part of ancient Sufi movements which are still in existence today … Rabia's Sufism developed as a result of her inborn capacity … not only from being taught Rabia can also be considered the first Sufi teacher who taught by using ""demonstration Her life was totally devoted to love of God the ascetic life and self-denial. Her reputation for asceticism survives through numerous stories. It is said that her only possessions were a broken jug a rush mat and a brick which she used as a pillow. She spent all night in prayer and contemplation reciting the Qur'an and chided herself if she fell asleep because it took her away from her active Love of God. More interesting than her absolute asceticism is the concept of Divine Love that Rabia introduced. She was the first to introduce the idea that God should be loved for God's own sake not out of fear—as earlier Sufis had done. ""She was ""the first to explain the Higher Love in Islamic Sufism."" The purely ascetic way of life did not remain a goal in itself. In the middle of the eight century the first signs of genuine love mysticism appears among the pious. Its first representative was a woman She taught that repentance was a gift from God because no one could repent unless God had already accepted him and given him this gift of repentance. Sinners must fear the punishment they deserved for their sins but she also offered sinners far more hope of Paradise than most other ascetics did. Intimacy with God was not the result of ""work"" but of self-abandonment; it is God who draws near to those who love God not the lover who draws near to the beloved. For herself she held to a higher ideal worshiping God neither from fear of for she saw such self-interest as unworthy of God's servants; emotions like fear and hope were like veils—that is hindrances to the vision of God Himself. She prayed:
""O Allah! If I worship You for fear of Hell and if I worship You in hope of Paradise But if I worship You for Your Own sake grudge me not Your everlasting Beauty.” that is attributed to her is of unknown origin. Gibb comments that she preferred the ""illuminative from the contemplative life "" which in his opinion is closer to and perhaps derived from Christian mysticism. non-Muslims have often attributed the development of love-mysticism in Islam to external influence yet ""not a few Qur'anic verses speak of God as a 'lover:' for example 'Allah will bring a people whom He loveth and who love Him'; other verses speaks of the believers 'love for God'."" Though she had many offers of marriage and (tradition has it) one even from the Amir of Basra she refused them as she had no time in her life for anything other than God. One story has the Prophet Muhammad asking her in a dream whether she loved him who is there who does not love thee? But my love to God has so possessed me that no place remains for loving or hating any save Him "" which suggests that love for any man would represent a distraction for her from loving God. Hasan of Basra is also reputed to have asked her to marry him. Rabia was in her early to mid eighties when she died having followed the mystic Way to the end. She believed she was continually united with her Beloved. As she told her Sufi friends ""My Beloved is always with me."" As she passed away those present heard a voice saying Rabi'a' and the Issue of Gender Marriage is considered a duty in Islam Rabia is never censored in any of the literature for having remained celibate. In including her as a saint in his series of biographical sketches Farid al-Din Attar does begin on a defensive note: ""why have you included Rabe'a in the rank of men?' my answer is that the prophet himself said 'God does not regard your outward forms ...' Moreover if it is permissible to derive two-thirds of our surely it is permissible to take religious instruction from a handmaid of A'esha."" 'wasn't a single woman but a hundred men."" Most Muslim men appear to have no problem learning from Rabia. ""I want to put out the fires of Hell and burn down the rewards of Paradise. They block the way to God. I do not want to worship from fear of punishment or for the promise of reward but simply for the love of God.""Smith. 2001. page 98.</ref> At one occasion she was asked if she hated Satan. Hazrat Rabia replied: ""My love to God has so possessed me that no place remains for loving or hating any save Him."" Once Hazrat Rabia was on her way to Makka and when half-way there she saw the Ka'ba coming to meet her. She said ""It is the Lord of the house whom I need what have I to do with the house? I need to meet with Him Who said 'Who approaches Me by a span's length I will approach him by the length of a cubit.' The Ka'ba which I see has no power over me; what joy does the beauty of the Ka'ba bring to me?"" ""did you ever perform any work that caused God to favor and accept you?"" She replied may be counted against me."" Her pioneering of love-mysticism in Islam produced a rich legacy. The poetry and philosophy of
Farid ad-Din Attar stands on her shoulders. It is primarily from his work that what little biographical information we have has survived. However lack of details of her life is compensated by the abundance of stories of her piety and total trust in God to provide for her every meal. Her love of God and her confidence in God's mercy was absolute; since God provided for ""those who insult Him"" her would surely ""provide for those who love Him"" as well. The high praise that Rabia attracts from Muslim men as well as from Muslim women testifies to the value of her legacy as a guide for others to realize the same intimacy with God that she enjoyed. The fact that details of her life have not survived while her reputation for piety has means that her achievements do not overshadow her devotion to God. Not only did she not teach at a prestigious institution or establish one but exactly where she did teach remains obscure Nonetheless her legacy impacted significantly on religious life and thought. ʻAṭṭār and Arberry. 1966. page 51. ʻAṭṭār and Arberry. 1966. page 40 ʻAṭṭār and Arberry. 1966. page 49.

If you have bookmarks or links to our site on your blog or website We are now World History Encyclopedia Ancient History Encyclopedia has now been around for almost twelve years. Since then over 136 million people have used our website to learn about history making it one of the most-read history publications in the world. Our project has won awards and it is recognized by prestigious institutions of learning; the name Ancient History Encyclopedia has become an established brand not only in historical circles. We have now covered most of the ancient world a significant part of medieval and we have just started about colonial history and early modern Europe. Our publication is no longer exclusively about ancient topics and covers increasingly more recent historical subjects. We have outgrown our name. The time has come to rebrand and change our name to a name that better reflects our organization and its aspirations. This monumental change will occur over several months starting with the change of our name this week. We will initially continue to use our much-beloved and highly-recognized ancient.eu as our domain name and switch to our new domain name in a few months' time. At the same time we are in the process of incorporating a charity in the United Kingdom to own the publication and all related intellectual property. No rebranding is complete without a new logo of course! Our new logo was designed by Dorothée Olivereau a French graphic designer. In the design process we wanted to ensure that our new logo reflects the fact that our brand is a continuation of Ancient History Encyclopedia which is why we decided on a very similar shape and layout. The symbol in the red square is inspired by representing the earliest form of writing. If cuneiform writing is the earliest form of history then a website like ours is the latest form of history and we cover everything in between. A symbol representing writing itself is also fitting for an encyclopedia. The central shape is also reminiscent of the “play” symbol found on media players highlighting the digital media aspect of AHE while also guiding the eye towards the writing on the right. Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter! We’re very happy with this new branding: It’s very unique and recognizable and it’s linked to our roots in ancient history.

The result was British control over much of North America. But the war had cost England a great deal of money and Parliament decided it was time for the colonies to pay a share for their own defense. . This law required the purchase of tax stamps to buy paper. The colonists were outraged. After years of ""Salutary Neglect"" wherein Colonial taxes were not collected by the British the new policy was unwelcome. The colonists had always considered themselves Englishmen. Among the rights granted to all Englishmen was a voice in Parliament — something they didn't have. With the Stamp Act ""Taxation without representation is tyranny "" became a battle cry.

The Americans reacted by forming organized political groups such as The people of Boston were most outspoken and violent in their reaction to taxes. They threatened and harmed British customs officials trying to collect taxes. So the British quartered troops in Boston to protect their officials.

The Second Continental Congress met in Philadelphia on and they declared themselves the government.

Until recently the secondary and tertiary displays were Apple Thunderbolt one of them started causing my Mac to kernel panic nearly every time it entered sleep mode so I started looking for a replacement. I decided to upgrade the failing Thunderbolt display to an HDPI monitor that would match the 5K resolution of my iMac Pro's ""retina display.""  After a thorough search I came up with the following list of options: - LG UltraFine 27"" 5K display 299 27"" LG ""UltraFine"" monitor is the 5K display.  Even though Apple sells millions of iMacs with 5K displays model is available.  I have no idea why other manufacturers don't produce 5K panels but at least it made my choice pretty easy. The build quality of the LG UltraFine 5K display is top-notch.  Its matte black frame is sleek and unobtrusive with a barely-noticeable LG logo on the front.  At first I thought it was strange that the top of the bezel was thicker than the bottom and sides.  But it blends in surprisingly well with the rest of the bezel and it stopped bothering me after the first day.  The stand is well-designed making it easy to adjust both the height and vertical angle of the screen.  While it is an LG monitor the quality could pass for an Apple product which is probably why Apple recommends it on their website.  It's also probably why it costs more than $1 Setting up the monitor requires only two cables — a power cable for AC power and a 3 cable for video and data.  I plugged in the monitor and my iMac Pro immediately recognized it and selected the correct ""LG UltraFine"" color profile.  Thanks to the Thunderbolt connection the connected Mac automatically identifies the display as well as the built-in camera and speakers. ▶ 2560x1400 is the standard resolution for the UltraFine 5K display.  When you select this setting it still uses the full resolution of 5120x2880 to display images and text with 2x ""HDPI"" or ""retina display"" sharpness. I had high expectations for this $1 so I was a little disappointed to find it wasn't perfect.  There were bright spots near the top of the monitor (noticeable on a black screen) and the side-angle view was much worse than I expected.  Fortunately a Geek Squad tech from Best Buy helped me solve the bright spot issue.  He told me to physically press on the panel where the light was leaking through.  I did this using a soft cloth and actually heard the panel snap into place.  The bright spots are now barely noticeable and no longer bother me.  Thanks the poor side-view angle cannot be fixed.  The glare is excessive when I'm not looking directly at the display.  If I view it from a sharp angle I can hardly see anything on the screen — much worse than any Apple display I've used.  Fortunately I rarely look at the display from an extreme angle so I've been able to ""overlook"" this issue. For the first few days I used the LG display the text seemed a bit fuzzier compared to my iMac Pro display.  But after a couple of days the text strangely seemed to become more clear.  I've never heard of monitors having a break-in period but maybe this one did.  Or maybe I just got used to it.  After a few weeks of use I have no complaints about the sharpness of the .  It's a great display and the colors are spot-on closely matching my iMac Pro.  The white levels are even a little better possibly because my iMac Pro display is almost three years old. The Thunderbolt 3 connection enables the LG UltraFine 5K display to serve as a hub.  While the three USB-C ports are nice I would have appreciated at least one additional Thunderbolt port for daisy-chaining as well as a USB 2.0 port.  Nearly all so I don't understand why LG didn't include one or two of these more practical .  The color is a little too saturated but it's a decent alternative to the undersaturated camera on my iMac Pro.  The speakers are far from impressive but they are at least on par with my iMac Pro speakers.  If you use this display with a it will probably be a slight improvement.  Thanks again to the Thunderbolt connection macOS automatically detects the monitor's built-in camera and speakers.  You can easily select the LG A/V options from System Preferences or supported programs You can also adjust the LG display's brightness using the macOS brightness slider in System Preferences or the macOS 11 control panel.  If you're using Big Sur you can click anywhere on the screen to make it ""active "" then use the brightness keys on your keyboard. Connects with a single Thunderbolt 3 cable No USB 2.0 ports or additional Thunderbolt 3 ports Limited viewing angle compared to Apple displays LG's 5K display is a simple monitor without any special features — but I think that's why I like it so much.  It just works.  The display quality is top-notch and it integrates perfectly with macOS.  I wish it had a few different ports on the back and a better viewing angle would be nice the LG UltraFine 5K display costs almost as much as a 5K iMac.  You could buy a used iMac with a built-in 5K display for less and use it as a second monitor instead.  Even so the LG 5K display works so well I think it's worth the premium price. LG has produced multiple versions of the 27"" UltraFine 5K display over the past few years.  I reviewed model number 27MD5KL-B.

Hm... a workstation is a place where work gets done.  It refers to a computer (and often the surrounding area) that has been configured to perform a certain set of tasks or video production.  An office may have several workstations for different purposes which may be assigned to certain employees.  For example one workstation may be used for scanning and importing images while another is used for editing images. Because workstations often work together like in the example above together.  This allows them to send files back and forth over the network which is important for various types of media production.  To use another example a user at a photo-editing workstation may prepare images to be used in a video clip.  Once the images are ready he may send them to another user at a video-editing workstation where they are incorporated into the video.  Once the video has been put together the video file may be sent to another user at an audio production workstation where the soundtrack and other sound effects are added. While workstations are often part of a network machines as well.  Even a home computer can be a workstation if it is used for certain kinds of work.  So if you want to sound professional the next time you send an e-mail to a friend from your home PC you can let him know you are sending it from your home workstation. ,[],Yes,"technology:0.15798208117485046,business:0.13410262763500214",

So was it worth the premium price?  Let's find out. let's start with the specs: 3.0 GHz 10-core Intel Xeon W processor with Turbo Boost up to  4.5GHz 64 GB 2666 MHz DDR4 ECC memory Radeon Pro Vega 64 with 16GB of HBM2 memory 000 is an absurd cost for a .  For a media professional though it is still on the high-end when it comes to price.  But I'm more concerned about the value than the absolute price.  The value is determined by the performance and the time it saves me. The space gray iMac Pro replaced my three-year-old .  Right off the bat I noticed... no significant difference. and moving files were the same speed.  (Note: I am running macOS 10.13 High Sierra with APFS on both systems.)  Opening but programs like Photoshop and Dreamweaver still took several seconds to open.  With a faster processor I expected more time savings here.  But the difference was minimal. The iMac Pro did not impress with everyday tasks.  But what about operations — the kind of things for which this computer is designed?  One of the first apps I tested was Apple Photos.  I had recently imported a few thousand photos from my trip to Antarctica to my iMac which I transferred to my iMac Pro during the initial migration.  Most of these images were Canon raw images that were 20 to 30 in size.  On my old iMac I could hold the right arrow key and the computer would display 2 to 3 images per second.  Soon the fan would kick up to full speed and the rate would slow to about one image per second eventually stopping.  On my iMac Pro I could hold the right arrow key Photos would cruise through about 10 images per second without slowing down.  I did this for about a minute but the iMac Pro just kept going like it wasn't even trying.  And these were roughly 25 MB raw images.  I was impressed. My old iMac struggled to play 4K video at 60 fps especially when the files were encoded with the new HEVC .  It could play movies relatively smoothly for a few seconds but then it would drop frames.  Soon the Ultra HD video would get so choppy it was barely running at one frame per second.  The iMac Pro which has built-in hardware support for HEVC played 4K full-screen video seamlessly in 60 fps.  This was impressive but it was also what I expected. I played StarCraft II with maxed out graphics settings in the highest resolution (5 880).  Even the mighty Radeon Pro Vega 64 couldn't keep up with these settings.  It was so choppy the game was unplayable (and I made the mistake of playing a ranked ladder match which I promptly lost).  When I reduced the resolution to standard HD (1920 x 1080) the Radeon Pro Vega 64 had no problem keeping up even when there was lots action on the screen.  To be fair I don't think even the NVIDIA Titan can produce smooth frame rates for modern games in 4K.  It requires four times the rendering per second which is a huge jump from HD. the fan has seldom been audible on the iMac Pro.  It is only noticeable when I play 4K video for several minutes or when I load a game in StarCraft II.  Thankfully it does not constantly whir at a high speed during StarCraft II gameplay like my old iMac did. The iMac Pro has an incredibly innovative design that is roughly the same as every iMac released in the past ten years (note the sarcasm).  It's not a horrible design but it is pretty poor.  I was disappointed Apple didn't come up with a better design for the iMac Pro.  They could have done much better than simply changing the color of the frame to space gray.  I continue to find it annoying to plug in behind the screen.  The Thunderbolt 3 ports are nice but I use two of them for my Apple Thunderbolt displays which each require a $50 adapter ($100 total) and downgrade the throughput to Thunderbolt 1. I don't understand why Apple does not finally do away with the old iMac design. there is no reason to put the entire computer behind the display.  It would be much more elegant to put the primary components in a small box and have a super-thin display floating above it.  Plus it would make it much easier to plug in and remove devices which professionals like myself do on a regular basis.  The slot on the back of the iMac is one of the most challenging interfaces to use in the modern era. So is the iMac Pro a good value?  If you are a video producer and you need the fastest computer you can get the crazy amount of cores in the iMac Pro might be worth it.  For everyone else there is no need to make the jump to the iMac Pro.  A maxed out iMac with similar specs is $5 300 and I doubt most people would notice any difference in performance between the two.  So unless you are encoding video or rendering high-res 3D graphics on a daily basis the regular iMac is a better value.

Until recently the secondary and tertiary displays were Apple Thunderbolt one of them started causing my Mac to kernel panic nearly every time it entered sleep mode so I started looking for a replacement. I decided to upgrade the failing Thunderbolt display to an HDPI monitor that would match the 5K resolution of my iMac Pro's ""retina display.""  After a thorough search I came up with the following list of options: - LG UltraFine 27"" 5K display 299 27"" LG ""UltraFine"" monitor is the 5K display.  Even though Apple sells millions of iMacs with 5K displays model is available.  I have no idea why other manufacturers don't produce 5K panels but at least it made my choice pretty easy. The build quality of the LG UltraFine 5K display is top-notch.  Its matte black frame is sleek and unobtrusive with a barely-noticeable LG logo on the front.  At first I thought it was strange that the top of the bezel was thicker than the bottom and sides.  But it blends in surprisingly well with the rest of the bezel and it stopped bothering me after the first day.  The stand is well-designed making it easy to adjust both the height and vertical angle of the screen.  While it is an LG monitor the quality could pass for an Apple product which is probably why Apple recommends it on their website.  It's also probably why it costs more than $1 Setting up the monitor requires only two cables — a power cable for AC power and a 3 cable for video and data.  I plugged in the monitor and my iMac Pro immediately recognized it and selected the correct ""LG UltraFine"" color profile.  Thanks to the Thunderbolt connection the connected Mac automatically identifies the display as well as the built-in camera and speakers. ▶ 2560x1400 is the standard resolution for the UltraFine 5K display.  When you select this setting it still uses the full resolution of 5120x2880 to display images and text with 2x ""HDPI"" or ""retina display"" sharpness. I had high expectations for this $1 so I was a little disappointed to find it wasn't perfect.  There were bright spots near the top of the monitor (noticeable on a black screen) and the side-angle view was much worse than I expected.  Fortunately a Geek Squad tech from Best Buy helped me solve the bright spot issue.  He told me to physically press on the panel where the light was leaking through.  I did this using a soft cloth and actually heard the panel snap into place.  The bright spots are now barely noticeable and no longer bother me.  Thanks the poor side-view angle cannot be fixed.  The glare is excessive when I'm not looking directly at the display.  If I view it from a sharp angle I can hardly see anything on the screen — much worse than any Apple display I've used.  Fortunately I rarely look at the display from an extreme angle so I've been able to ""overlook"" this issue. For the first few days I used the LG display the text seemed a bit fuzzier compared to my iMac Pro display.  But after a couple of days the text strangely seemed to become more clear.  I've never heard of monitors having a break-in period but maybe this one did.  Or maybe I just got used to it.  After a few weeks of use I have no complaints about the sharpness of the .  It's a great display and the colors are spot-on closely matching my iMac Pro.  The white levels are even a little better possibly because my iMac Pro display is almost three years old. The Thunderbolt 3 connection enables the LG UltraFine 5K display to serve as a hub.  While the three USB-C ports are nice I would have appreciated at least one additional Thunderbolt port for daisy-chaining as well as a USB 2.0 port.  Nearly all so I don't understand why LG didn't include one or two of these more practical .  The color is a little too saturated but it's a decent alternative to the undersaturated camera on my iMac Pro.  The speakers are far from impressive but they are at least on par with my iMac Pro speakers.  If you use this display with a it will probably be a slight improvement.  Thanks again to the Thunderbolt connection macOS automatically detects the monitor's built-in camera and speakers.  You can easily select the LG A/V options from System Preferences or supported programs You can also adjust the LG display's brightness using the macOS brightness slider in System Preferences or the macOS 11 control panel.  If you're using Big Sur you can click anywhere on the screen to make it ""active "" then use the brightness keys on your keyboard. Connects with a single Thunderbolt 3 cable No USB 2.0 ports or additional Thunderbolt 3 ports Limited viewing angle compared to Apple displays LG's 5K display is a simple monitor without any special features — but I think that's why I like it so much.  It just works.  The display quality is top-notch and it integrates perfectly with macOS.  I wish it had a few different ports on the back and a better viewing angle would be nice the LG UltraFine 5K display costs almost as much as a 5K iMac.  You could buy a used iMac with a built-in 5K display for less and use it as a second monitor instead.  Even so the LG 5K display works so well I think it's worth the premium price. LG has produced multiple versions of the 27"" UltraFine 5K display over the past few years.  I reviewed model number 27MD5KL-B.

1620763175.582711,96011134,https://www.ushistory.org/libertybell/index.html,"Betsy Ross and the American Flag Tradition tells of a chime that changed the world on July 8 with the Liberty Bell ringing out from the tower of to hear the first public reading of the The Pennsylvania Assembly ordered the Bell in 1751 to commemorate the 50-year anniversary of Pennsylvania's original Constitution. It speaks of the rights and freedoms valued by people the world over. Particularly forward thinking were Penn's ideas on religious freedom his liberal stance on Native American rights and his inclusion of citizens in enacting laws. The Liberty Bell gained iconic importance when abolitionists in their efforts to put an end to slavery throughout America adopted it as a symbol. As the Bell was created to commemorate the golden anniversary of Penn's Charter the quotation ""Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof was particularly apt. For the line in the Bible immediately preceding ""proclaim liberty"" is ""And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year."" What better way to pay homage to Penn and hallow the 50th year than with a bell proclaiming liberty? Also inscribed on the Bell is the quotation ""By Order of the Assembly of the Province of Pensylvania for the State House in Philada."" Note that the spelling of ""Pennsylvania"" was not at that time universally adopted. In fact the name of the state is also spelled ""Pensylvania."" If you get a chance to visit the second floor of Independence Hall in Philadelphia take a moment to look at the original maps on the wall. They (and the Atlantic Ocean called by the name of that day ""The Western Ocean""). The choice of the quotation was made by Quaker Isaac Norris Centered on the front of the Bell are the words ""Pass and Stow / Philada / MDCCLIII."" We'll get to Pass and Stow in a bit. There is widespread disagreement about when the first crack appeared on the Bell. Hair-line cracks on bells were bored out to prevent expansion. However it is agreed that the final expansion of the crack which rendered the Bell unringable was on Washington's Birthday in 1846. The Philadelphia Public Ledger takes up the story in its February 26 ""The old Independence Bell rang its last clear note on Monday last in honor of the birthday of Washington and now hangs in the great city steeple irreparably cracked and dumb. It had been cracked before but was set in order of that day by having the edges of the fracture filed so as not to vibrate against each other ... It gave out clear notes and loud and appeared to be in excellent condition until noon when it received a sort of compound fracture in a zig-zag direction through one of its sides which put it completely out of tune and left it a mere wreck of what it was."" The Liberty Bell. Boston: American Anti-Slavery Society The Bell achieved its iconic status when abolitionists adopted the Bell as a symbol for the movement. It was first used in this association as a frontispiece to an 1837 edition of published by the New York Anti-Slavery Society. the abolitionists who gave it the name ""Liberty Bell "" in reference to its inscription. It was previously called simply the ""State House bell."" it is a remarkably apt metaphor for a country literally cracked and freedom fissured for its black inhabitants. The line following ""proclaim liberty"" is ""It shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family."" The Abolitionists understood this passage to mean that the Bible demanded all slaves and prisoners be freed every 50 years. reprinted a Boston abolitionist pamphlet containing a poem about the Bell which represents the first documented use of the name The Bell and the Declaration of Independence George Lippard wrote a fictional story for which told of an elderly bellman waiting in the State House steeple for the word that Congress had declared Independence. The story continues that privately he began to doubt Congress's resolve. Suddenly the bellman's grandson who was eavesdropping on the doors of Congress This story so captured the imagination of people throughout the land that the Liberty Bell was forever associated with the Declaration of Independence. The truth is that the steeple was in bad condition and historians today highly doubt that the Bell actually rang in 1776. However its association with the Declaration of Independence was fixed in the collective mythology. Americans sought a symbol of unity. The flag became one such symbol and the Liberty Bell another. To help heal the wounds of the war the Liberty Bell would travel across the country. the Bell traveled to cities throughout the land ""proclaiming liberty"" and inspiring the cause of freedom. We have prepared a photo essay of its 1915 journey to the Panama-Pacific Exposition A replica of the Liberty Bell was used to promote women's suffrage. It traveled the country with its clapper chained to its side silent until women won the right to vote. On September 25 it was brought to Independence Hall and rung in ceremonies celebrating the ratification of the 19th amendment. oppressed groups come to Philadelphia to give voice to their plight proclaiming their call for liberty. a letter was sent to Robert Charles the Colonial Agent of the Province of Pennsylvania who was working in London. Signed by Isaac Norris it represented the desires of the Assembly to purchase a bell for the State House (now Independence Hall) steeple. The bell was ordered from Whitechapel Foundry with instructions to inscribe on it the passage from Leviticus. The bell arrived in Philadelphia on September 1 but was not hung until March 10 on which day Isaac Norris wrote ""I had the mortification to hear that it was cracked by a stroke of the clapper without any other viollence [sic] as it was hung up to try the sound."" The cause of the break is thought to have been attributable either to flaws in its casting or as they thought at the time to its being too brittle. Two Philadelphia foundry workers named John Pass and John Stow were given the cracked bell to be melted down and recast. They added an ounce and a half of copper to a pound of the old bell in an attempt to make the new bell less brittle. For their labors they charged slightly over 36 Pounds. The new bell was raised in the belfry on March 29 it seems that they have added too much copper. They were so teased with the witticisms of the town that they will very soon make a second essay "" wrote Isaac Norris to London agent Robert Charles. Apparently nobody was now pleased with the tone of the bell. Pass and Stow indeed tried again. They broke up the bell and recast it. On June 11 the New York Mercury reported ""Last Week was raised and fix'd in the Statehouse Steeple cast here by Pass and Stow Norris wrote to Robert Charles that he was still displeased with the bell and requested that Whitechapel cast a new one. Upon the arrival of the new bell from England it was agreed that it sounded no better than the Pass and Stow bell. So the ""Liberty Bell"" remained where it was in the steeple and the new Whitechapel bell was placed in the cupola on the State House roof and attached to the clock to sound the hours. The Liberty Bell was rung to call the Assembly together and to summon people together for special announcements and events. The Liberty Bell tolled frequently. Among the more historically important occasions it tolled when Benjamin Franklin was sent to England to address Colonial grievances it tolled when King George III ascended to the throne in 1761 and it tolled to call together the people of Philadelphia to discuss the Sugar Act in 1764 and the Stamp Act in 1765. In 1772 a petition was sent to the Assembly stating that the people in the vicinity of the State House were ""incommoded and distressed"" by the constant ""ringing of the great Bell in the steeple."" it continued tolling for the the Battle of Lexington and Concord in 1775 and its most resonant tolling was on July 8 when it summoned the citizenry for the reading of the the steeple was in bad condition and historians today doubt the likelihood of the story. the British occupied Philadelphia. Weeks earlier all bells were removed from the city. It was well understood that they would likely be melted down and used for cannon. The Liberty Bell was removed from the city and hidden in the floorboards of the which you can still visit today. Throughout the period from 1790 to 1800 when Philadelphia was the nation's capital uses of the Bell included calling the state legislature into session summoning voters to hand in their ballots at the State House window and tolling to commemorate Washington's birthday and celebrate the Fourth of July. children who are descendants of Declaration signers symbolically tap the Liberty Bell 13 times while bells across the nation also ring 13 times in honor of the patriots from the original 13 states. the bell is gently tapped in honor of Martin Luther King Day.

Those events quite definitely took place and were public knowledge from the beginning. Most of us learned about all those things in school. Upon learning later that Betsy Ross's flag creation has not been established with the same level of certainty as those other events some conclude that it was therefore a myth or a hoax like George Washington and the cherry tree. That's a genuine American myth. Betsy is not. The available evidence is insufficient to establish Betsy as the creator of the flag with certaintly. But it's entirely plausible and consistent with the evidence we do have. Some suggest that sexism explains the reluctance to accept Betsy's achievements but perhaps it is simply a misunderstanding of the process of history. Historians don't have all the answers. They don't have a complete and reliable record of the past. Historians need to interpret the available evidence to construct as accurate a picture of the past as they can and sometimes the available evidence is incomplete and inconclusive. That's very different from a hoax or a myth. and blue of the flag represent? Why are the stars in a circle? The stars were in a circle so that no one colony would be viewed above another. It is reported that George Washington said ""Let the 13 stars in a circle stand as a new constellation in the heavens.""

That she said it was square and a flag should be one third longer than its width that the stars were scattered promiscuously over the field and she said they should be either in lines or in some adopted form as a circle and that the stars were six-pointed in the drawing and she said they should be five pointed."" Why would Betsy Ross be chosen to make the flag? It was usual in that day for upholsterers to be flagmakers. As Betsy Ross prayed in the pew next to George Washington and had already sewn buttons for him and she was a niece of George Ross it is not exceptional that these members of the Flag Committee formed by the Continental Congress would call upon Betsy Ross to make the flag. It is known that Betsy Ross rented rooms here. At the time of the alleged flag creation she was either here at 239 Arch Street or next door at 241 Arch where the garden is now.

Today life is almost like pre-corona times.  People go shopping and go out to eat at restaurants. Almost no Swedes wear masks in public spaces. Instead of enforcing extreme measures like other countries Sweden responded to the coronavirus with three primary actions: Encouraging people to keep their distance in public places Suggesting people do not use public transportation if possible Limiting most gatherings to 50 people or less these actions – or suggestions – seem to be working well.  Life is almost normal in Sweden and the health impact of the coronavirus has not been worse than most other countries.  Sweden was affected a little more on the front-end of the pandemic.  However the weekly covid death total was in the single digits for the entire country of 10 million people. I felt the need to post this update because news outlets refuse to report this information.

I understand a can protect electronics.  It makes sense that a power conditioner can prolong the life of electronic devices.  But improve audio and video quality?  Come on. Here's thing crazy thing... it actually does. After unboxing my new Panamax M5400-PM I spent more than an hour disconnecting all my home theater devices from my old Monster Power line conditioner and connecting them to my new Panamax box.  If you're wondering why it took so long let's just say there were a lot of hard to reach cables in a cramped and very dark space.  I do not envy people who configure home theater systems for a living. The back of the M5400-PM includes 10 clearly-labeled outlets separated into five isolated banks.  Bank 5 is a high-current bank which is a nice feature but since there is only one high-current bank I had to plug my only two high-current devices into the same bank which I was hoping to avoid.  So my Denon AVR-X4500H receiver and my Bowers and Wilkins DB4S subwoofer are both plugged into bank 5. Also why is bank 5 on the left?  And why are all the receptacles upside down? When I finally plugged in the power conditioner to my wall outlet everything started up like a charm.  The first thing I noticed was the sequenced startup which delays the powering on of individual outlet banks.  This feature prevents a surge of power from hitting all the connected devices at once.  After about five seconds the M5400-PM sent power to my receiver and subwoofer which confirmed I had connected the devices correctly. The second thing I noticed was the bright lights on the front.  This thing can seriously light up your entire room if you leave the brightness setting on high.  I was shocked to discover there is no way to turn all the lights off.  What's also annoying is that even the lowest brightness setting still shows the backlit ""Voltage In"" and ""Voltage Out"" text — but without displaying the voltage.  Who thought this made sense?  And then as soon as you bump the brightness setting up one notch the blue rings appear around the voltage making the power conditioner visible from a mile away. I understand that many people place their power conditioner in an AV box with frosted glass.  But for those of us without such fancy hardware the lights are seriously distracting.  The brightness settings should be: Dim with no voltage information (or voltage text) Bright enough to light up the entire room I don't understand how things like this get through quality control. But let's talk about performance.  As soon as I turned on my TV I heard the difference.  The sound was more clear and I could hear more separation between frequencies.  It was like I had EQ'd or recalibrated my home theater but all I did was plug my equipment into a new power conditioner.  Amazing. I was especially surprised because I was so skeptical before trying out this Panamax device.  But my skepticism further validates the improvement in audio quality I heard.  It's almost like I have new speakers.  I wish I could say the device improved the video as well but since my Sony A9F is wall-mounted I have it plugged into a compact WattBox line conditioner. I can't tell if the voltage regulation feature of the M5400-PM works (the main difference between this model and the M5300-PM).  Whenever ""voltage in"" changes from 118 to 122 the ""voltage out"" value changes with it.  I thought ""voltage out"" would stay at 120v but I guess not.  I emailed Panamax support over a week ago and still have not received a response.  Maybe there is a threshold before the voltage regulator kicks in but I'm not sure because the one-page manual included with the power conditioner didn't mention it.  If anyone knows how this works The device also emits a faint low-frequency buzz which is nearly inaudible most of the time but seems to kick up when the voltage regulator is working harder.  For example when I turn on my AVR the Panamax buzzes a little louder for a few seconds.  I am especially sensitive to buzzes and background noises so I was concerned this would be an issue.  But I'm happy to say the ""hum"" from the voltage regulator has not been noticeable enough to bother me even in a quiet room when all the devices are off. Front lights cannot be turned off The Panamax M5400-PM does what it says it will do — it improves audio quality.  It probably enhances video as well; I just couldn't test it directly.  The question is whether or not this gadget is worth a retail price of over $800.  If you don't have low/high voltage issues the M5300-PM might be a better option and you won't have to worry about any buzz or hum. I also compared the Panamax M5400-PM vs the Furman Elite-15 PFi power conditioner.  I was going to use the Furman instead but the bright blue light on the front of the Elite-15 PFi was not dimmable at all (what is the deal with this?) and I noticed better sound quality with the Panamax.  So I plan to keep using the M5400-PM with the lights on the dimmest setting. With a price tag higher than a PlayStation 5 the Panamax M5400-PM is not for everyone.

1620763177.614801,63166436,https://pc.net/glossary/definition/surgeprotector,The surge protector is an important yet often overlooked part of a computer setup.  It allows multiple devices to plugged in to it at one time and protects each connected device from power surges.  For example a home office may have a computer and powered speakers all plugged into one surge protector which is plugged into a single outlet in the wall.  The surge protector allows many devices to use one outlet while protecting each of them from electrical surges. prevent surges in electrical current by sending the excess current to the grounding wire (which is the round part of the plug below the two flat metal pieces on U.S. outlet plugs).  If the surge is extra high such as from a lightning strike a fuse in the surge protector will blow and the current will prevented from reaching any of the devices plugged into the surge protector.  This means the noble surge protector will have given its life for the rest of the equipment since the fuse is destroyed in the process. While surge protectors all perform the same basic function they come in many shapes and sizes with different levels of protection.  Some may look like basic power strips while others may be rack mounted or fit directly against the wall.  Most surge protectors offer six to ten different outlets.  Cheaper surge protectors offer limited protection for surges (under 1000 joules) while more expensive ones offer protection for several thousand joules and include a monetary guarantee on connected devices if a power surge happens.  Typically you get what you pay for so if you have an expensive computer system it is wise to buy a quality surge protector that offers at least 1000 joules of protection. Some surge protectors also include line conditioning which uses an electromagnet to maintain a consistent level of electricity when there are slight variations in current.  For example you might notice your computer monitor or television fade for a moment when you turn on a high-powered device like a vacuum or air conditioner.  A surge protector with line conditioning should prevent connected devices from being affected by these slight variances in current. While you may be able to hook up your computer system without a surge protector it is important to protect your equipment by using one.  You may not need a large expensive surge protector with line conditioning but using a quality surge protector for all your electronic devices is a smart choice. ,[],Yes,"technology:0.19415993988513947,business:0.01253738347440958",

I placed the soft part of my sweatshirt over my hand and lightly pushed along the top of the screen below the bezel.  As I did I heard the panel snap into place.  The result?

He continued teaching in Chicago until his retirement in 1991 when he became Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Political Science. who predeceased him by a few months. Morton Kaplan died on September 27 2017 at the age of 96; survived by his son Anthony Mondon. Kaplan was buried beside his wife in Oakwood Cemetery in Kaplan published extensively in the areas of international relations and international politics. His interests and knowledge were wide-ranging and he was able to integrate concepts from Language and the Human Condition System and Process in International Politics a seminal work in the scientific study of international relations. A critic of and of the policies of the he served as editor of the 1978 collection . He predicted the end of Soviet communism at a 1985 conference of the Professors World Peace Academy held in a brave announcement that not only was the first to describe its imminent collapse but which also suggested ways to transition peacefully to a new system. Kaplan's most significant contribution to the field of international relations was the development of a new analytical tool His approach is detailed in his 1957 publication System and Process in International Politics . He proposed that looking at the structure of the international system itself would provide information regarding how the individual states interact with one another. Kaplan used systems analysis to differentiate among the various types of international state systems: the ""balance of power"" system and the Unit Veto International System. Kaplan's view contrasts with that of - that it might be possible to isolate some basic social and political rules; rather Kaplan's alternative theory of justice is his a kind of decision procedure for evaluating social which attempts to circumvent the limitations of an egocentric or culturally narrow perspective while providing sufficient context to make a judgment. Kaplan was active in a number of professional groups including serving as president of the Professors World Peace Academy consultant for the National Endowment for the Humanities chairman of the International Conference on the Unity of the Science magazine from its founding in 1986 until 2004. Kaplan's involvement with organizations connected with Reverend led to some concern at the University of Chicago at one point putting his appointment to the chair of the political science department at risk. Undaunted he continued to support these organizations as well as offering personal introductions to Reverend Moon at a number of public speaking engagements where Kaplan's quirky humor was enjoyed by all present.

Founded in 1890 by the oil magnate the University of Chicago held its first classes on October 1 1892. Chicago was one of the first universities in the country to be conceived as a combination of the American interdisciplinary liberal arts and the German research university. It was the first major university to enroll women on an equal basis with men and has always held a non-sectarian perspective. Following the German precedent of a research university the University of Chicago revolved around a number of graduate research institutions. It has been remarkably successful in its research endeavors. Affiliated with over 80 the University of Chicago is widely regarded as one of the world's foremost universities. As a result the number of graduate students greatly outnumbers that of undergraduates. Historically the university is noted for the unique undergraduate core curriculum pioneered by Robert Maynard Hutchins in the 1930s and for influential academic movements such as the the Chicago School of Sociology the Chicago School of Literary Criticism and the law and economics movement in legal analysis. The University of Chicago was the site of the world's first man-made self-sustaining . It is also home to the largest university press in the United States. The university continues to strive for excellence in research contributing in numerous was to the advancement of knowledge about the world. founded the school in 1890. Westward migration and industrialization led to an increasing need for elite schools away from the East Coast especially schools that would focus on issues vital to national development. Though Rockefeller was urged to build in or the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States he ultimately chose Chicago. His choice reflected his strong desire to realize 's dream of a natural meritocracy's rise to prominence determined by talent rather than familial heritage. Rockefeller's early fiscal emphasis on the physics department showed his pragmatic the University of Chicago has never had a sectarian affiliation. The school's traditions of rigorous scholarship were established primarily by Presidents William Rainey Harper and Robert Maynard Hutchins. Chicago opened its door to women and minorities from the very beginning a time when they seldom had access to other leading universities. It was the first major university to enroll women on an equal basis with men as well as the first major predominantly white university to offer a black professor a tenured position The university has also been an incubator for several prominent business ventures with the world’s first management consultancy and the United States first international corporate law firm all having been founded by University of Chicagoans. The University of Chicago was founded by the American Baptist Education Society and oil magnate who later called it ""the best investment I ever made."" The University's founding was part of a wave of university foundings that followed the the University has dated its founding as July 1 when William Rainey Harper became its first president. The first classes were held on October 1 with an enrollment of 594 students and a faculty of 120 including eight former college presidents. located on the Main Quadrangles. Unlike many other American universities at the time (with the notable exception of the University of Chicago revolved around a number of graduate research institutions following Germanic precedent. The College of the University of Chicago remained quite small compared to its East Coast peers until around the middle of the twentieth century. the graduate population of the university dwarfs the undergraduate population 2:1 to this day while the university's undergraduate student body remains the third smallest amongst the top 10 national universities. The student-to-faculty ratio is 4:1 one of the lowest amongst national universities and all faculty members are required to teach undergraduate courses. Robert Maynard Hutchins met with the president of rival Northwestern University to discuss the future of the two institutions through the Depression and the looming war. Hutchins concluded that in order to secure the future of both universities it was in the best interest of both for the two campuses to merge as the ""Universities of Chicago "" with Northwestern's campus serving as the site for undergraduate education and the Hyde Park campus serving as the graduate studies campus. President Hutchins' vision for what he hoped would become the preeminent university in the world was eventually undermined by Northwestern University's board of trustees a result that Hutchins called ""one of the lost opportunities of American education."" the university conducted a more successful experiment on the college. To make the university a preeminent undergraduate academic institution administrators decided to implement President Hutchins' philosophy of Secular Perennialism. This led to the innovation of the common core an educational strategy in which students read original source materials rather than textbooks and discuss them in small groups using the Socratic method rather than a lecture approach. The common core is still an important feature of Chicago's undergraduate education. In addition to pioneering this new undergraduate curriculum the university took steps to eliminate ""distractions"" such as varsity sports fraternities and religious organizations. This attracted free-thinkers such as to the university. The university succeeded in eliminating all varsity sports for 20 years and all but four fraternities. In addition to its contributions to higher education the University of Chicago made significant contributions to twentieth century science. In 1909 Professor Robert Millikan performed the historic oil-drop experiment in the Ryerson Physical Laboratory on the university campus. This experiment allowed Millikan to calculate the charge of an and paved the way for quantum mechanics in the 1940s. The American Physical Society now designates Ryerson Laboratory an historic physics site. began to study the newly manufactured radioactive element . The George Herbert Jones Laboratory was the site where a trace quantity of this new element was isolated and measured in September 1942. This procedure enabled chemists to determine the new element's atomic weight. Room 405 of the building was named a National Historic Landmark in May 1967. Buildings such as these within the main quadrangle epitomize the neo-Gothic architecture that is present throughout the campus. scientists achieved the world's first self-sustained nuclear reaction at Stagg Field on the campus of the university under the direction of professor now deemed a National Historic Landmark where the nuclear reaction took place. Stagg Field has since been demolished to make way for the Regenstein Library. In addition to its groundbreaking work in physics the University of Chicago is recognized for numerous other important scientific discoveries developed in 1949 by Willard Frank Libby and his team during his tenure as a professor at the university. Libby was awarded the The discovery of the atmosphere's jet stream. The procedure for the nation's first living-donor liver transplant. considered to be the classic experiment on the origin of life. that would gain notoriety for its use during the the University of Chicago became the birthplace of improvisational comedy with the formation of the undergraduate comedy troupe the university’s literary journal the under editors Irving Rosenthal and Paul Carroll The material appeared in the Spring 1958 edition. The university was criticized for publishing fiction deemed obscene by a columnist in the and suppressed the Winter 1959 issue which contained more material from the manuscript. The university administration fired Rosenthal and Carroll who regarded the university's attempt at suppressing became President of the University of Chicago the first woman ever to serve as the president of a major research university. Erman Biology Center is reflected in a puddle of water in the winter. the Consortium on Chicago School Research (CCSR) was created after the passage of the Chicago School Reform Act that decentralized governance of the city's public schools. Researchers at the University of Chicago joined with researchers from Chicago Public Schools and other organizations to form CCSR with the imperative to study this landmark restructuring and its long-term effects. Since then CCSR has undertaken research on many of Chicago's school reform efforts some of which have been embraced by other cities as well. Thus CCSR studies have also informed broader national movements in public education. then-President Hugo Sonnenschein announced plans to relax the university's famed core curriculum reducing the number of required courses from 21 to 15. When and other major news outlets picked up this story the university became the focal point of a national debate on education. The National Association of Scholars It is truly depressing to observe a steady abandonment of the University of Chicago's once imposing undergraduate core curriculum which for so long stood as the benchmark of content and rigor among American academic institutions. but the controversy led to Sonnenschein's resignation in 2000. the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute became the center of controversy when U.S. federal courts ruled to seize and auction its valuable collection of ancient the proceeds of which would go to compensate the victims of a 1997 bombing in Jerusalem that the United States claims was funded by . The ruling threatens the university's invaluable collection of ancient clay tablets held by the Oriental Institute since the 1930s but officially owned by Iran. the University of Chicago received an anonymous alumni donation of $100 million. The donation serves as the cornerstone of a $400 million undergraduate student aid initiative for enhanced financial aid packages called Odyssey Scholarships which will eliminate student loans entirely among students whose annual family income is less than $60 000 and will eliminate half the student loan packages among students whose annual family income is between $60 000. The College expects nearly a quarter of the entire College population to benefit from the program. with several towers of the Main Quadrangle. The University of Chicago is principally located seven miles (11 km) south of downtown Chicago in the Hyde Park and Woodlawn neighborhoods. The campus is bisected by a large linear park created for the 1893 World's Fair. While the bulk of the campus is located north of the Midway some of the professional schools are located south of the Midway. The quadrangles of the main campus feature a botanical garden and neo-Gothic buildings constructed mostly out of in the late nineteenth century. The tallest building is Rockefeller Chapel designed by Bertram Goodhue. Buildings of the original quadrangles were deliberately patterned after the layouts of is a smaller-sized reproduction of Oxford's Magdalen Tower is a duplicate of Oxford's Christ Church Hall. The Rockefeller Chapel at the University of Chicago Contemporary buildings have attempted to complement the style of the original architecture. Notable examples include the Laird Bell Law Quadrangle by Eero Saarinen the School of Social Service Administration by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and the Robie House by . The largest modern addition is the Regenstein Library designed by architect Walter Netsch and constructed on the grounds of the former Stagg Field the site of the world's first nuclear reaction. The University of Chicago also maintains a number of facilities apart from its main campus. The university's Graduate School of Business maintains campuses in a campus located on the left bank of the River Seine in hosts various undergraduate and graduate study programs. constructed in 1897 and located in Williams Bay is home to the largest refracting telescope ever built. Although Yerkes was never able to match the observation conditions afforded by the mountaintop location of its main competitor the telescope was a leader in . Yerkes was the first telescope to determine the spiral structure of the Milky Way Galaxy and the first to observe carbon in stellar spectra. The University of Chicago campus is also home to the Oriental Institute and research center for ancient Near Eastern studies. The Institute is housed in an unusual Gothic and building designed by the architectural firm Mayers Murray & Phillip. The Museum has artifacts from digs in . Notable possessions include the famous Megiddo Ivories a 40-ton human-headed winged lamassu from Khorsabad the capital of Sargon II the tallest structure on campus. Jones and Kent Halls covered in snow on the central quads. The University of Chicago's economics department is particularly well-known. In fact an entire school of thought (the ) bears its name. Led by the university's economics department has played an important role in shaping ideas about the free market. The Chicago School of Economics is also famous for applying economic principles to every aspect of human life as famously demonstrated by University of Chicago Professor Steven Levitt in his best-selling book The university is also known for creating the first which later gave birth to the Chicago School of Sociology. Scholars affiliated with this school are considered pioneers in the field and include The university is home to several committees for interdisciplinary scholarship the most famous of which is the Committee on Social Thought. One of several Ph.D-granting committees at the university it was started in 1941 by University of Chicago president Robert Maynard Hutchins along with historian John U. Nef Robert Redfield. The committee is interdisciplinary but it is not centered on any specific topic. Since its inception the committee has drawn together noted academics and writers to ""foster awareness of the permanent questions at the origin of all learned inquiry"". Members of this program have included the University of Chicago implemented the University of Chicago School Mathematics Project a comprehensive mathematics program for students from kindergarten through twelfth grade. Today an estimated 3.5 to 4 million students in elementary and secondary schools in every state and virtually every major urban area are now using UCSMP materials. located on the East Quadrangles. The University of Chicago currently maintains 12 units: the College four divisions of graduate research and the Graham School of General Studies. The University of Chicago also operates the Library Faculty and students at the adjacent Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago also collaborate closely with the university. the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) is also located on the campus and many faculty members and graduate students hold research appointments at NORC. The university also operates the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools (from and considered one of the leading the Hyde Park Day Schools (for the learning disabled of otherwise exceptional ability) and the Orthogenic School (a residential treatment program for those with behavioral and emotional problems). The university also administers two unaffiliated public charter schools on the South Side of Chicago. The University of Chicago Press is the largest university press in the country. It publishes a wide array of scholarly and academic texts as well as several academic journals The University of Chicago's library system is also one of the largest in the country. The university's Regenstein Library is committed to providing physical ""browsable"" access to print books in a single location rather than relying on offsite storage as many libraries do. In 2005 funding was approved for the construction of a 308 600 m²) addition to the library to accommodate an expansion of its collection. When the expansion is complete the Regenstein will contain the largest browsable collection of print volumes in the United States. The university expects to finish construction by winter of 2009. "" as it is commonly called by students is noted for its exceptional breadth and depth of material. In its 2007 rankings ranked it among the top college libraries in the country. The John Crerar Library is recognized as one of the best libraries in the country for research and teaching in the sciences and technology. Completing the science quadrangle is the Kersten Physics Teaching Center which is recognized as the most advanced facility in the United States for teaching undergraduate physics. Students in the College have access to all of the university’s special libraries including the D’Angelo Law Library the Social Service Administration Library and the Eckhart Library for mathematics and computer science. Chicago also operates a number of off-campus scientific research institutions including the Argonne National Laboratory part of the United States Department of Energy's national laboratory system. The university also owns and operates the Oriental Institute and has a stake in the Apache Point Observatory in Sunspot . It is also a founding member of the Committee on Institutional Cooperation. located on the Main Quadrangles. The College of the University of Chicago grants Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees in 52 majors and 14 minors in the biological as well as in the humanities and interdisciplinary areas. A major may provide a comprehensive understanding of a well-defined field or it may be an interdisciplinary program such as African and African-American studies or cinema and media studies. Undergraduate students must undergo a rigorous core curriculum the goal of which is to impart an education that is both timeless and a vehicle for interdisciplinary debate. Students must take courses designed to foster critical skills in a broad range of academic disciplines and critical reasoning. Core curriculum classes at Chicago contain no more than 25 students and are generally led by a full-time professor (as opposed to a teaching assistant). Chicago's sports teams are called the Maroons and their colors are maroon and white. They participate in the 's Division III as members of the University Athletic Association (UAA). At one point the University of Chicago's football teams (nicknamed the at the time) were among the best in the country winning seven Big Ten Conference titles from 1899 to 1924 including a national championship in 1905 while playing at the old Stagg Field. Chicago's Jay Berwanger was the winner of the first-ever Heisman Trophy. The following year Berwanger also became the first player to be drafted by the (a founding member of the Big Ten Conference) de-emphasized varsity athletics in 1939 when it dropped football and withdrew from the league in 1946. It would reinstate football as a Division III team in 1969 continuing to play its home games at the new Stagg Field. The Maroon football team has won the University Athletic Association championship in 1998 2000 and 2005. The University maintains an academic affiliation with the Big Ten schools through the Committee on Institutional Cooperation a consortium of 12 Midwestern research universities. chosen in honor of the city of Chicago's rebirth after the Great Chicago Fire and also in honor of the Old University of Chicago which dissolved due to financial reasons (making the current University of Chicago the second university to carry the name). The gargoyle has become an unofficial mascot of the university owing to the ubiquitous statues of gargoyles that adorn many of the buildings on campus. Chicago's fight song is which was written in 1929. featured in the 2005 film Notable extracurricular groups include The University of Chicago College Bowl Team which has won 118 tournaments and 15 national championships leading both categories internationally. The Chicago Debate Society has had a top four team at the American Parliamentary Debate Association's National Championship tournament on several occasions. In addition University of Chicago. Retrieved February 3 2009.</ref> has often placed in the top-ten nationally. Finally the University's Model United Nations Team is also one of the most competitive on the college circuit. The team also hosts its own college-level conference Chicago Friends of Israel is an active student group on campus that seeks to promote Israel awareness and brings speakers ranging from journalists and politicians to filmmakers to discuss issues relating to Israel. In the past they brought speakers such as Richard Perle Former Assistant Secretary of Defense and Former Director of Defense Policy Board and journalist Christopher Hitchens. In 2007 they screened the Oscar-winning West Bank Story short film in conjunction with a charity fundraiser with over 230 students and staff in attendance. an undergraduate student organization that brings world leaders to speak on campus is the University's spearhead organization in bringing major speakers to campus. Chicago Society's most famous event titled ""China and the Future of the World"" held in the spring of 2006 consisted of a two-day symposium on China's rapid political and social development and its impact on the world. For the symposium Chicago Society brought in numerous high-level American and Chinese government officials including Wang Guangya the Chinese ambassador to the UN; Christopher Hill head of the American delegation in the North Korea six-way talks; and Peter Rodman U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. The university's independent student newspaper is the the same year as the university the newspaper is published every Tuesday and Friday. published by students in the Graduate School of Business is one of the oldest student-run theater organizations in the country involving as many as 500 members of the university community producing 30 to 35 shows a year and selling on the order of 10 000 tickets. It also operates Off-Off Campus one of the University's improv comedy troupes started in 1986 by Bernard Sahlins one of the founders of Second City. that have established histories with Chicago and Sigma Phi Epsilon (fraternities) as well as Alpha Omicron Pi and Kappa Alpha Theta (sororities). - The university's annual carnival hosted by the Council on University Programming accompanied by a spring concert put on by the Major Activities Board. - Milkshakes sell for only one dollar every Wednesday at the Reynolds Club. - A midnight breakfast is held during every ""finals week"" of the academic year attracting students and faculty members alike. - At 10:00 p.m. on the Sunday night before ""finals week"" of the winter quarter the University of Chicago track team streaks through the Regenstein Library. the University of Chicago has set time aside before classes begin to provide an introduction to the University for all new students. - A festival hosted by the Council on University Programming celebrating Chicago in the winter. Often referred to as Kuvia it entails a variety of events and a rigorous program of early morning exercise (kangeiko a Japanese tradition of winter training) that culminates in a yoga-influenced ""salute to the sun "" performed outdoors in freezing temperatures just before the sun rises. not (but nearly) all of whom are Jewish about the relative merits of latkes and homentashn respectively. The lectures are a great opportunity for ordinarily serious scholars to crack jokes in a mock-serious tone. The best were collected in a book edited by Ruth Fredman Cernea. students and residents of Hyde Park assemble near Pick Hall to watch the shadow cast by Virginio Ferrari's sculpture. Student legend holds that a hammer and sickle like that of the flag of the former will be cast on the sidewalk at noon on this date. - Every year a group of students select the coldest day of the winter quarter and volunteers run from one end of the college campus (Harper building) to the gates in front of the Regenstein Library. Most continue due to the freezing cold straight into the warmth of the library. - According to a common superstition among university students stepping on University Seal (located in the main lobby of the Reynolds Club) as an undergraduate will prevent the student from graduating in four years. Another common myth about the university is that nearly 50 percent of its students marry a fellow alumnus. Before the first sorority opened many students believed the lack of sororities was a condition made by La Verne Noyes when donating money for Ida Noyes hall because his daughter had died in a sorority hazing. In fact Ida was La Verne's wife (although she did die unexpectedly) and her adult portrait hangs in her namesake building. located on the Main Quadrangles. founded in 1932 (originally the Documentary Film Group) is the oldest student film society in the country. In "" Doc Films is described as: ""Hard-core beyond words and lay comprehension the society is populated by 19-year-olds who have already seen every film ever made and boasts its own Dolby Digital-equipped cinema and an impressive roster of alumni that includes snob-revered critic Dave Kehr."" Doc Films screens a different film on every night of the week.

1620763215.913113,81222440,https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Communism,"Part of the Politics series on refers to a theory for revolutionary change and political and socioeconomic organization based on common control of the means of production as opposed to private ownership. While communism or it views social revolution and the violent overthrow of the existing social order as essential components in the process. At its roots Marxism-Leninism is atheistic and materialistic. The underpinnings of . Marxism denied the existence and the reality of any deity. Marx explicitly distinguished his communism from previous “utopian” religious or ethical socialisms. In his early writings Marx viewed religion as a deliberate distraction meant to lead the oppressed to divert their attention to what he viewed as fabricated otherworldly concerns rather than address the exploitation that resulted from capitalism and previous class-based models of society such as feudalism and the slave society. A major force in world politics since the early twentieth century modern communism is generally associated with the theories of as expressed in works such as (1863) as well as seminal works of Vladimir Lenin such as (1916) According to Marxist theory of Political Economy Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism the capitalist profit-based system of private ownership is rooted in exploitation and is rife with internal contradictions. According to Marx capitalism produces alienation in the working class because of private ownership of the means of production by the ruling class and an economic system where profit is wholly based on exploitation of the labor class. The internal contradictions within capitalism especially the ownership of the labor class work product by the capitalists led to laborers feeling alienated from the products of their labor their own essential human identity (species-essence) and their fellow workers. Marx maintained that this alienation would be exacerbated over time and that the capitalist system would experience economic breakdown and social disorder due to laborers being replaced by machinery. Because of the Marxist axiom that only labor can produce profit this would lead to a decrease in profits and an increase in poverty leading to worker dissatisfaction and eventually a revolutionary overthrow of the bourgeoisie by the proletariat enlightened labor class. Following this social revolution capitalism would be replaced by a socialist society in which the means of production would be controlled by the workers. Socialism would represent a transitional stage under the dictatorship of the proletariat. This would be followed by a withering away of the state and the emergence of communism. Collapse of the Soviet Union and Communism Today communism seeks to overthrow capitalism through a workers' revolution and establish a find its fulfillment and expression in any actual communist revolution. It was precisely in the developing countries not the industrialized capitalist nations where the so-called ""communist"" revolutions occurred. The theory of Marxism was adapted by revolutionaries into new theories that often placed intellectuals rather than laborers in the leadership roles of what Lenin described as the Revolutionary Vanguard. Hence instead of focusing on capitalist industrialized states virtually all communist revolutions transpired in feudal agrarian-based societies. These revolutions were typically led by bourgeois class intellectuals and supported by peasants. The word communism is now mainly understood to refer to life under conditions of Communist party rule which since 1989 has dwindled to only a few states Communism in the twentieth century proved to be one of the most heinous perpetrators of . There is broad consensus that communism took the lives of at least 100 as documented in the writings of French author Stephane Courtois and the Hoover Institution scholar Robert Conquest. Communism maintains that history has gone through a process of necessary revolutions which have focused on which sector of society controls the means of production. In accord with communist theory the first human society was organized into a primitive communal system in which the means of production were shared by all members of that society. Marxism traces human history across several class based social systems following the collapse of the primitive communal society. Included in these class societies are the slave society and capitalist society. In his early writings Marx maintained that societies in all parts of the world went through the same process of social development and he postulated that movement from one level of class society to another was always characterized by revolution and the violent overthrow of the previous class-based society. framework. Marx denied any form of deity. In his doctoral dissertation (1841) he championed the Greek mythological figure Prometheus for his utterance “I hate all the Gods.” Marx maintained that Prometheus should be the “patron saint” of all philosophers. When his writings in the the newspaper that he edited upon completion of his doctorate Marx had himself portrayed as in a caricature in the paper. The Marxist theory of surplus value was an integral part of his whole system of thought analysis of power and authority and materialism. Marx diagnosed faults in the economic system to be the cause of social evils and characterized human history as a process of class struggles between those who owned the means of production and those who did not and presented communism as a classless society in which “people work according to ability and gain according to their needs.” Marx presented the communist economic system as a remedy to end all social evils that ever existed in human history. However all communist or socialist states failed in their economy and were characterized by oppression in their political tactics. Without exception they became police states with unimaginable levels of repression (1916) as well as Marx’s and Engel’s (1848) as a justification for such repression. Scholars often pointed to as the source of the problem however it has become increasingly clear that repression and brutality originated with Lenin's rise to power in the Soviet Union his intent to improve the conditions of the working class motivated parties across Europe. Responding to pressures from within the labor movement itself European socialists largely tried to gain concessions for workers. Many of their initiatives contributed to a ""reforming"" of capitalism rather than to its overthrow. This focus gained increasing popularity following the collapse of efforts by to establish a unified laborer front in Europe (The First International). took exception to efforts to reform capitalism rather than overthrow it. Lenin rejected the assertion by while Marx's intentions were noble the component parts of his theory were irreparably flawed. Lenin's Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism (1916) argued that Marx's economic theories were wholly accurate and that the reason why capitalism had not collapsed was due to the capitalist powers establishing overseas colonies where they could ship their goods establish high interest rates for financing the purchase of such goods and provide a portion of those profits to bribe their domestic labor class so that that class would remain complacent and unsupportive of efforts to overthrow the State. communism became a social institution. Workers and Socialist parties in other countries tended to support the Communist Party of the Soviet Union even if they did not agree with their internal policies. Parties in Europe Asia and in the Americas pledged allegiance to Lenin’s Third International (1919) which was based on the ideology and methods used by Lenin to assume power. After regimes calling themselves communist took power with Soviet support in Eastern Europe. In 1948 a pro-communist regime was also established by in North Korea (Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea). In 1949 the Communists in came to power and established the approximately one-third of the world's population lived under was established in 1919. One of the reasons why the Communist Party lost much of its credibility was due to the strong opposition that the Communist Party USA had to any American involvement or support for military action against Nazi Germany. The Communist Party USA maintained this position until attacked the Soviet Union in 1940; hence the intentions of the Party in the United States became suspect. The Communist Party USA along with the French Communist Party were probably the communist parties that most closely followed the Soviet line. In Western Europe communist parties were more mainstream. Since the early 1970s the term ""Eurocommunism"" was used to refer to the policies of Communist Parties in Western Europe which sought to break with the tradition of uncritical and unconditional support of the Soviet Union. Eurocommunists were politically active and electorally significant in With the collapse of the Communist governments in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s and the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 Communism's influence has virtually disappeared in Europe but approximately one quarter of the world's population still lives under some type of Communist Party rule . Although the Chinese Communist Party continues to have control over much of the political life of its country its economic and political reforms contradict much of Marxist theory. China has instituted significant economic reforms and is gradually implementing expansion of the rule of law. communism grew out of the workers' movement of nineteenth century Europe. Yet the ideal of communism has roots in Western thought extending back to ancient Greece. Communitarian life is the major theme in where Plato advocated for the sharing of property including wives and children. Communitarian life was also theme of early Christianity and of many of the monastic orders that followed. In the sixteenth century portrayed a society based on common ownership of property whose leaders administered it through the application of reason. Criticism of the idea of private property continued into the . Utopian socialist writers such as are also regarded as precursors to Marxism. In March 1871 French revolutionaries established the Paris commune the first attempt to establish a communist state. The failed revolution was heralded by Karl Marx—however it collapsed within a few weeks. argued that several groupings in the especially the Diggers (or ""True Levellers"") espoused clear communistic socialist critics saw that capitalism had brought about an unskilled working proletariat who toiled under harsh conditions and argued that this development widened the gap between rich and poor. This was not the first time that thinkers and activists had called for more just and egalitarian conditions in society. Indeed appeals of such nature can be traced back for millennia. saw capitalism as being based on the exploitation of workers. But while other favored longer-term social reform within existing social structures Marx’s theory called for a revolutionary movement of workers to overthrow the bourgeoisie. According to Marx's laws of economic movement capitalism was destined to centralize wealth and power in fewer and fewer hands creating group of owners that could then be overcome by the revolutionary proletariat. The ranks of the revolutionary proletariat would grow as per Marx's economic axioms could only come through labor. In the increasingly industrialized society that Marx depicted laborers continued to be replaced by machines which according to Marx's law could not produce profit. Since Marx believed that the state had no independent role but was merely an extension of the ruling class he predicted that no systematic reform of capitalism would be possible. Only a revolution could displace powerful capitalists. In his depiction of historic development Karl Marx argued that primitive communism was the original state of humankind. Marx postulated an original but this state was not ideal since it was not developed. The end of the original state paralleled the Christian myth of the ""fortunate fall."" Indeed in Marx refers to the emergence of the private control of the means of production as “the original sin.” Through humankind would develop its economic potential but with an unjust system of distribution. In his writings Marx called for a revolutionary break with the past which would lead humanity back through socialism and the dictatorship of the proletariat to a return to the ideal state of communism but at a higher level of development than primitive communism. According to Marx’s arguments for communism the main characteristic of human life in class society is . The primary form of alienation is the worker being alienated from the product of his work. Communism provides a vehicle for overcoming alienation by allowing the workers to feel a sense of ownership over the product of their labor after the overthrow of capitalism. This would lead to the full realization of human freedom and human potential. Marx here follows in conceiving of freedom as not merely an absence of constraints but as action having moral content. According to Marx not only does communism allow people to do what they want but it also puts humans in such conditions and such relations with one another that they would not have the need to exploit others. For Hegel the unfolding of this ethical life in history is mainly driven by the dialectical relations of ideas. For Marx communism emerged from a dialectical process in history that led to changes in the control of the means of production and would culminate in communism and shared ownership of the means of production. Marxism holds that a process of class conflict and revolutionary struggle will result in victory for the proletariat and the establishment of a communist society in which private ownership is abolished and the means of production and subsistence belong to the community. Marx himself wrote little about life under communism giving only the most general indication of what the communist society would represent such as the popular slogan from ""from each according to his abilities to each according to his needs."" (1845) was one of Marx's few writings to elaborate on the communist future: where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow to hunt in the morning rear cattle in the evening just as I have a mind In the latter half of the nineteenth century the terms ""socialism"" and ""communism"" were often used interchangeably. However Marx and Engels came to see as an intermediate stage of society in which most productive property was owned in common but with some class differences remaining. Because the possibility for counter revolution and a return to capitalism existed Marx and Engels and Lenin emphasized the need for establishing a dictatorship of the proletariat during the socialist stage of development toward communism. Marx and Engels reserved the term communism for a final stage of society in which class differences had disappeared and government was no longer needed. Later writers modified Marx's vision by allotting a central place to the state in the development of such societies by arguing for a prolonged transition period of socialism prior to the attainment of full communism. but differed in their views on how to reach a harmonic society with no classes. To this day there has been a split in the workers movement between Marxists (communists) and anarchists although the anarchists have been a decided minority. The anarchists are against every state organization. Among them anarchist-communists believe in an immediate transition to one society with no classes as opposed to Communist parties are the organizations that can help usher in this society. undertook the modern world's first effort to build socialism on a large scale following the of 1917. This resulted in significant theoretical and practical debates about communism among Marxists themselves. Marx’s theory had predicted that revolutions would occur in countries where capitalist development was the most advanced and where a large working class was already in place. Russia was the poorest country in Europe with an enormous and little industry. Under these circumstances it was necessary for the communists according to their ideological mission to create a working class before communism could ever hope to be realized. the socialist Mensheviks opposed the Bolshevik revolution on the grounds that the socialist revolution could not take place before capitalism had been established. In seizing power the Bolsheviks found themselves without a program beyond their pragmatic and politically successful slogans ""peace "" which had tapped the massive public desire for an end to Russian involvement in the and the peasants' demand for land reform. The usage of the terms ""communism"" and ""socialism"" shifted after 1917 when the Bolsheviks changed their name to the Communist Party and installed a single-party regime devoted to the implementation of socialist policies. Under the Bolsheviks broke completely with the moderate socialist movement withdrew from the Second International and formed the Third International the term ""communism"" was applied to the ideology of the parties founded under the umbrella of the Comintern. Their program after Lenin's theoretical alterations to Marxism called for uniting the workers of the world for revolution which would be followed by the establishment of a dictatorship of the proletariat and the development of a socialist economy. Ultimately their program asserted that a harmonious classless society would develop and the state would wither away. In the early 1920s the Soviet Communists formed the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.) from the former Russian Empire. Following Lenin's theory of democratic centralism Communist parties were organized on a hierarchical basis with a network of active cells comprising the broad base. These cells were made up only of elite cadres approved by higher members of the party as reliable and completely subject to party discipline. During the Russian Civil War (1918–1920) the new regime nationalized all productive property. When mutiny and peasant unrest resulted Lenin declared the New Economic Policy (NEP 1923) which permitted some privatization and overseas investment. However 's personal fight for leadership spelled the end of the NEP and he used his control over personnel to abandon the program. The Soviet Union and other countries ruled by Communist parties came to be described as “Communist states” with “state socialist” economic bases. This usage indicated that they proclaimed to have realized part of the socialist program by establishing communist party rule abolishing private control of the means of production and establishing state control over the economy. One of the most important aspects of Lenin’s reform of Marx’s theories was his decision to replace the dictatorship of the proletariat with the dictatorship of the revolutionary vanguard. In (1901) Lenin maintained that by themselves the workers would never achieve the realization of the proletarian identity. He maintained that a revolutionary vanguard composed of revolutionaries who were often the sons of bourgeois families would be responsible for instilling the proletarian identity and values into the working class. Vladimir Lenin himself was trained as a lawyer and Stalin had been a seminarian. there was a struggle for power between . Trotsky’s and Stalin’s views differed on how to advance world communism. Trotsky who had played a key role in the victory over the White Russians (opponents to the Bolshevik revolution) favored “permanent revolution” emphasizing that the Soviet Union should support revolutionary efforts wherever such opportunities presented themselves. Stalin on the other hand emphasized the need to establish one strong socialist state before promoting revolution elsewhere. Attempts by Trotsky and his supporters to remove Stalin from power resulted in Trotsky's exile in 1929. After Trotsky's exile world communism fractured in two distinct branches: a Trotskyist rival to the Comintern in 1938. He was assassinated in Mexico in 1940 by a Soviet agent. Though Trotskyism remained popular in the West among certain more radical elements the ideology was never accepted in Communist circles in the Soviet bloc even after Stalin's death; nor has Trotsky's interpretation of communism ever been successful in effecting a revolution that would bring about the overthrow of a state. However Trotskyist ideas have occasionally found an echo among political movements in countries experiencing social upheavals (such is the case of Alan Woods's Trotskyist Committee for a Marxist International which has had contact with President Hugo Chávez of ). Most Trotskyist parties today are active in politically stable assumed power in the Soviet Union following the death of Vladimir Lenin in 1924. Stalin had great skills in administration and in building a loyal bureaucracy. While Trotsky was busy with military exploits Stalin realized the bureaucratic network that facilitated his rise to power. Stalin attempted to build communism via a massive program of industrialization and collectivization. The program of collectivization sparked oppression and famine in many parts of the Soviet Union most notable in Ukraine. The rapid development of industry and above all the emergence of the Soviet Union as one of the victors in the made Stalin a renowned figure in much of the communist world. A significant contribution that Stalin made to was his emphasis on socialism in one country which claimed that due to the ""aggravation of class struggle under socialism to build socialism in a single country. This theoretical innovation was largely based on the practical need to develop Soviet industry to compete with the Western industrial powers. To achieve this Stalin undertook a dramatic and unprecedented social transformation of Russian society. Stalin wrote on a variety of ideological themes but he had a particular interest in refining Marxism’s views on dialectical and historical materialism. The Soviet Union was weakened politically and militarily because of many of the policies pursued by Joseph Stalin. Stalin’s show trials of the late 1920-1930s led to elimination of all of Stalin’s political rivals including Sergey Kirov Nikolai Bukharin. This also led to the execution of more than thirty thousand top military officers. Because of the distrust fear and animosity that the show trials created the Soviet Union was in a weakened state and Stalin even tried to establish an alliance with Nazi Germany. To do this Stalin was obliged first of all to replace his foreign minister Maxim Litvinov who was a Jew with Vyacheslav Molotov a non-Jew. The pact signed by Vyacheslav Molotov and Nazi foreign minister Joachim Von Ribbentrop recognized that the two countries shared much in common in their ideological perspectives including a common animosity towards democratic powers. It was a pledge that neither power would aggress against the other. (1980) maintains that Hitler was the only leader that Stalin felt that he could trust. However when Germany’s attacks on Great Britain floundered in 1940 Hitler did not hesitate to announce a second war front- the Soviet Union. . In the aftermath of the war established a sphere of influence over as well as the Baltic States. The Soviet Union suffered some twenty million casualties during the Second World War. The hallmark of Stalinism was characterized by Stalin's own personal aggrandizement through a cult of personality and his paranoia which led to the rise of the secret police ( ) with sweeping powers and the . Under Stalin the Soviet Union became a thoroughly repressive state that dominated every aspect of life. After Stalin's death the Soviet Union's new leader admitted the enormity of the repression and undertook a de-Stalinization program after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party in 1956. particularly the Soviet sphere of influence had been vastly strengthened by the incorporation of the nations of Eastern Europe into what became the . In addition to the creation of Soviet client states in Eastern Europe other indigenous Marxist revolutions succeeded in the years after . Most important among these new revolutions were the ones that brought to power in North Korea (1948) and to power in China (1949). By the end of 1949 the Chinese Communists held all of China except thus controlling the most populous nation in the world. In 1950 marking the first military confrontation between communism and the West. This conflict eventually involved Russia the People’s Republic of China . The United Nations supported a General Assembly resolution authorizing the United Nations coalition of military forces under General a Communist government was created under Marshal Tito in Tito's independent policies led to the expulsion of Yugoslavia from the Cominform a new branch in the world communist movement Other areas where rising Communist strength provoked dissension and in some cases actual fighting included many nations of the Middle East and Africa . With varying degrees of success Communists attempted to unite with nationalist and socialist forces against Western imperialism in these poor countries. In 1959 communism established a beachhead in the Western hemisphere when assumed power in Havana. The Soviet Union had some success in supporting national liberation movements in Southeast Asia and in Africa. However Soviet efforts in Uruguay and Chile largely failed. By the end of the 1970s the Soviets agreed to rely on Castro for their strategies of advancement in Central and South America. In 1979 the pro-communist Sandinista government came to power in Nicaragua. Following the fall of Vietnam to pro-communist forces in 1975 communism made rapid inroads and by 1979 had all fallen into the Soviet sphere of influence. 's side on a ceremony arranged for Stalin's 71th birthday in Moscow in December 1949. made numerous important contributions to communist revolutionary theory and tactics especially outlining the ways in which revolution could succeed in agrarian states such as China. Mao’s relationship with Stalin was a difficult one however his relationship with the Soviet Union was further exacerbated by ’s denunciation of Stalin’s crimes and his cult of personality at the 20th Congress. Mao was deeply disturbed that he was not informed of this denunciation in advance nor was he invited to share his views on this stance. Khrushchev’s rise to power demonstrated that communism was not truly ""international"" in character. If it had been Mao rather than Khrushchev would have been viewed as the new ideological and revolutionary heir to Stalin. Khrushchev was a bureaucrat whereas Mao was a revolutionary who had succeeded in communizing the most populated country in the world. The 20th Congress and Khrushchev's reforms heightened ideological differences between China and the Soviet Union. A Sino-Soviet Split took place within the international Communist movement and this led to open hostility and military confrontations between the two powers over border issues. Maoist China portrayed itself as a leader of the underdeveloped world against the two superpowers the United States and the Soviet Union gaining recognition worldwide as a new branch of Marxism. Unlike most other political ideologies including other socialist and Marxist ones Maoism contains an integral military doctrine and explicitly connects a military strategy in its political ideology. In Mao's famous dictum ""political power comes from the barrel of the gun can be mobilized to undertake a ""people's war"" of armed struggle involving . Maoism emphasized revolutionary mass mobilization and the creation of village-level industries independent of the outside world. Deliberate organizing of mass military and economic power was deemed necessary to defend the revolutionary area from outside threat while centralization kept corruption under supervision. A key concept that distinguishes Maoism from other left-wing ideologies is the belief that the class struggle continues throughout the entire socialist period as a result of the fundamental antagonistic contradiction between capitalism and . Even when the proletariat has seized state power through a socialist revolution the potential remains for the bourgeoisie to restore capitalism. Indeed Mao famously stated that ""the bourgeoisie [in a socialist country] is right inside the Communist Party itself "" implying that corrupt party officials would subvert socialism if not prevented. This was the main reason for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in which Mao exhorted the public to ""bombard the [party] headquarters!"" and wrest control of the government from bureaucrats (such as Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiao Ping) who were perceived to be returning the country to capitalism. Mao's doctrine is best summarized in the which was distributed to everyone in China as the basis of revolutionary education. This book consists of quotations from the earliest days of the revolution to the mid-1960s just before the beginning of the Reviews of Mao’s rule are mixed. Mao’s left millions dead and his apparent unswerving commitment to personal revolutionary immortality led to millions of Chinese being deprived of education and human security during the Cultural Revolution. Nevertheless China emerged again as a sovereign power that was to be a key player in world developments. Collapse of the Soviet Union and Communism Today became chairman of the Communist Party in the Soviet Union. He attempted to address the stagnation that had set in during the designed to relax central control and introduce some market innovation. In foreign policy eventually refused to continue to enforce the borders of its communist satellites in Eastern Europe. When from all across Eastern Europe to stream into the West was torn down and street demonstrations brought down communist regimes in while other states underwent more peaceful transitions. All had abandoned Communist rule by 1990. Then hard-liners within the CPSU attempted to roll back some of Gorbachev's reforms through a coup d'etat. When the coup failed and was dissolved on December 25th The end of the Cold War was sealed in 1987 when following the Reykjavik talks between and Mikhail Gorbachev when Ronald Reagan refused to end American support of the Strategic Defense Initiative. When the Soviets accepted that the United States could continue this research this implied that the Soviet Union also resigned itself to accepting US military superiority over the Soviets. The era of nuclear parity and mutually assured destruction had thus ended and the United States had emerged as the sole remaining superpower. As the Soviet Union divested itself of its claims on Afghanistan these states and most of the republics of the Soviet Union began to opt for a democratic model of governance. At the beginning of the twenty-first century Communist parties still held power in China has reassessed many aspects of the Maoist legacy in China Cuba have reduced state control of the economy in order to stimulate growth. In North Korea power passed from father to son ( remain politically important in many European countries and throughout the Third World they have generally trended toward working within emerging capitalist societies rather than attempting to effect revolution or counter revolution. Today Marxist revolutionaries are active in the countries of India but today they exist primarily on the fringe of society. Criticism of communism has come from many different camps from communists and anti-communists alike. Marxist critics of the Soviet Union referred to the Soviet system along with other Communist states "" arguing that the Soviet system fell far short of Marx's communist ideal. They argued that the state and party bureaucratic elite acted as a surrogate capitalist class in the heavily centralized and repressive political apparatus. criticizing their inefficient and unwieldy state bureaucracy and central planning regime and their repressive police state organs. A diverse array of writers and political activists have published anticommunist work such as Soviet bloc dissidents and historians and social scientists Richard Pipes and R. J. Rummel among others. Some writers go beyond attributing large-scale human rights abuses to Communist regimes presenting events occurring in these countries as an argument against the ideology of communism itself. Some of the most creative and insightful critiques of communism developed in France during the 1970s and 1980s through the writings of Bernard-Henri Levy was a sobering postmortem on the failed 1968 efforts of the reformist leader Alexander Dubcek to create a new ""socialism with a human face."" rejoiced only a short time before the Soviets opted for a brutal crackdown on reform efforts in August 1968 and a putsch that led to the full reintegration of Czechoslovakia into the Warsaw Pact. The Russian dissident Igor Shafarevich concluded that there are four basic principles manifested in the activities of communist states and ideologies: the abolition of private property the abolition of the family the abolition of religion and equality or the abolition of hierarchy in society. The most widely propagated systematic critique and counter-proposal to communism was developed by Reverend of Korea. His critique surveyed and analyzed each of the ideological underpinnings of communism including Marx's Theory of Alienation the Labor Theory of Value the Theory of Surplus Value Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism. Introduced in his home country in the early 1950s Moon’s theory was widely taught in Korea and inside the communist world itself. a Soviet citizen and a did the most to reawaken opposition to communism in the West.

1620763242.894421,86090458,https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Soviet_Union,"was one of the dominant political entities of the twentieth century. The official name was the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). The brought to power the first communist party in history. took full advantage of the collapse of the Russian autocracy followed by the ineffectiveness of the provisional government to wrest control of the country. The revolution was never in alignment with since socialism was to be built in a capitalist economy. This problem ultimately proved to be too much to overcome. Efforts to develop a capitalist economy while creating a new socialist government system failed. What resulted was a command economic system with an increasingly totalitarian political system. The death of Lenin and the fate of the NEP Faction fighting in the Communist party and economic collapse. The demoralized Russian Army suffered severe military setbacks and many soldiers deserted the front lines. Dissatisfaction with the monarchy and its policy of continuing the war grew. Under mounting pressure from all sides mutiny and desertion were pervasive among conscripts; the intelligentsia was disaffected over the slow pace of reforms; was worsening; and income disparities and inequality were growing while the provisional government grew more and more autocratic and appeared on the verge of succumbing to a military junta. Deserting soldiers returned to the cities and gave their weapons to angry socialist factory workers. Conditions in urban areas were fertile ground for revolution. a provisional government was installed led first by Prince Georgy Yevgenyevich Lvov but it maintained its commitment to the war. The provisional government failed to enact land reforms demanded by the . More damaging politically was the inability of the provisional government to resolve the war situation or to move quickly enough toward elections. The promised Constituent Assembly was postponed while the government debated how to include absent soldiers in the voting. This insistence on universal suffrage in the middle of a crisis meant that before the Constituent Assembly was scheduled to meet the Bolsheviks and their Red Guard had the opportunity to seize power. 1917 (according to the Julian calendar then in use in Russia; the date was November 7 in the countries that used the current Gregorian calendar which Russia adopted in February 1918) led his forces in the uprising in St. Petersburg against the ineffective Provisional Government headed by the revolt in St. Petersburg was bloodless as the Red Guards led by Bolsheviks took over major government facilities with little opposition before finally launching an assault on the Winter Palace on the night of November 7–8. The assault was launched at 9:45 p.m. signaled by a blank shot from the cruiser The Winter Palace was guarded by Cossacks and cadets (military students) corps. It was taken at about 2:00 a.m. Official films made much later showed a huge storming of the Winter Palace and fierce fighting but in reality the Bolshevik insurgents faced little or no opposition and were practically able to just walk into the building and take it over. The insurrection was timed and organized by to hand state power to the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies which began on November 7. The Second Congress of Soviets consisted of 649 elected delegates; 390 were Bolshevik and nearly a hundred were left Socialist-Revolutionaries who also supported the overthrow of the Kerensky government. When the fall of the Winter Palace was announced the congress adopted a decree transferring power to the Soviets of Workers' thus ratifying the revolution. The transfer of power was not without disagreement. The center and right wings of the socialist revolutionaries as well as the Mensheviks believed that Lenin and the Bolsheviks had illegally seized power and they walked out before the resolution was passed. The following day the Soviet elected a Council of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom) as the basis of a new Soviet government pending the convocation of a Constituent Assembly and passed the Decree on Peace and the Decree on Land. When the Constituent Assembly eventually tried to convene they were turned away by Red Guardsmen. The Decree on Land ratified the actions of the peasants who throughout Russia had seized the lands of the and redistributed it. The Bolsheviks viewed themselves as representing an alliance of workers and poor peasants and memorialized that understanding with the Hammer and Sickle on the flag and coat of arms of the Soviet Union. later the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) initially enjoyed only a tenuous hold on power. They were also divided among their own party rank and file on tactics and some policy issues. Despite these problems they quickly consolidated their hold on state power over progressively larger portions of the country and enacted laws prohibiting any effective rival political party under the banner of ""democratic centralism."" the Bolsheviks had adopted the popular slogans ""all power to the Soviets!"" and ""land and bread!"" Soviets were councils assembled locally within a city with delegates elected from the workers of the various factories and other businesses. Soviets were the bodies of direct popular democracy; although they held no official position of power in the provisional government they exerted considerable influence over the hearts and minds of the working classes. the ""democratic"" element of democratic centralism was expressed in the party leadership's constitution that appeared to recognize the authority of the local Soviets. The highest legislative body was the Supreme Soviet. The highest executive body was the Politburo ( Organization of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union). ""centralism"" soon won out. Arguing that the revolution needed not a mere parliamentary organization but a party of action that would function as a scientific body of direction and a central control organ Lenin banned factions within party. He also argued that the party should be an elite body of professional revolutionaries dedicated to the cause and carrying out their decisions with iron discipline. This provided the rationale for putting loyal party activists in charge of new and old political institutions and food suppliers. Against this backdrop system would evolve and become standard practice. this system was to be democratic since all leading party organs would be elected from below but also centralized since lower bodies would be accountable to higher organizations. In practice ""democratic centralism"" was more ""centralism"" than ""democratic "" with decisions of higher organs binding on lower ones. Over time party cadres would grow increasingly careerist and professional. Party membership required exams and nominations by three existing members. was founded as the Bolshevik's first internal security force. It later went through many permutations as the GPU . These ""secret police"" were responsible for finding those viewed by the party as counter-revolutionary and expelling them from the party or bringing them to trial. On September 5 the Cheka was given responsibility for targeting remnants of the Tsarist regime opposing parties of the left such as the Social Revolutionaries and other anti-Bolshevik groups such as the Cossacks; this policy would be known as the ""We represent in ourselves organized terror—this must be said very clearly—such terror is now very necessary in the conditions we are living through in a time of revolution."" Bolshevik-led attempts to seize power in other parts of the Russian Empire were largely successful in Russia proper—although the fighting in lasted for two weeks—but they were less successful in ethnically non-Russian parts of the empire which had been clamoring for independence since the February Revolution. For example which had declared autonomy on June 23 created the Ukrainian National Republic on November 20 which was supported by the Ukrainian Congress of Soviets. This led to an armed conflict with the Bolshevik government in Petrograd and a Ukrainian declaration of independence from Russia on January 25 two rival governments emerged: the Estonian Diet declared independence on November 28 was recognized by Lenin's government as Estonia's leader on December 8 although forces loyal to Anvelt only controlled the capital . These disputes would only be resolved by civil war. One of the first acts of the Communist government was to withdraw from . Following the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk the Soviet Union turned over most of the area of supporters of the Tsarist regime broke out in revolt resulting in years of all-out civil war which lasted until 1922. Known as the ""whites "" these forces were aided by Western intervention. Allied armies led by the seeking to prevent the spread of communism or Russia's exit from the war effort attempted to invade the Soviet Union and support forces hostile to the Bolsheviks with the intention of reversing the Soviet takeover. the Bolshevik doctrine of democratic centralism argued that only a tightly knit and secretive organization could successfully overthrow the government; after the revolution they argued that only such an organization could prevail against foreign and domestic enemies. Fighting the civil war would actually force the party to put these principles into practice. The war was fought mainly between the ""Reds "" who were the communists and revolutionaries and socialists who opposed the Bolshevik Revolution. Also a group of nationalist and anarchist movements known as the ""Greens "" or sometimes the Black Army for the latter played a much smaller part in the war harrying both the Reds and the Whites and sometimes even each other. In addition and some other countries intervened on the side of the Whites which aggravated the civil war. The war was fought across three main fronts—the eastern and the northwestern. It can also be roughly split into three periods. The first period lasted from the revolution until the armistice. The conflict began with dissenting Russian groups the main force was the newly formed Volunteer Army in the Don region which was joined later by the Czecho-Slovak Legion in Siberia. In the east there were also two anti-Bolshevik administrations the Komuch in Samara and the nationalist Siberian government centered in Omsk. Most of the fighting in this first period was sporadic involving only small groups amid a fluid and rapidly shifting strategic scene. Among the antagonists were the Czecho-Slovaks known simply as the Czech Legion or White Czechs ( the Poles of the Polish 5th Rifle Division and the pro-Bolshevik Red Latvian riflemen ( The second period of the war was the key stage which lasted only from March to November 1919. At first the White armies' advances from the south (under Anton Denikin) the northwest (under Nikolai Nikolaevich Yudenich) and the east (under Aleksandr Vasilevich Kolchak) were successful pushing back the new Red Army and advancing towards which pushed back Kolchak's forces (in June) and Denikin's and Yudenich's armies (in October). The fighting power of Kolchak and Denikin was broken almost simultaneously in mid-November. The final period of the war was the extended siege of the last White forces in the Crimea. Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel had gathered the remnants of the armies of Denikin and they had fortified their positions in the Crimea. They held these positions until the Red Army returned from where they had been fighting the from 1919 or earlier. When the full force of the Red Army was turned on them the Whites were soon overwhelmed and the remaining troops were evacuated to which had established a shaky independent government following World War I and the former Tsarist empire were rendered chaotic by the repercussions of the Russian revolutions and civil war. Poland's forming a Polish-led East European bloc to form a bulwark against Russia and Germany while the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) attempted to carry the revolution westward. When Pilsudski carried out a military thrust into Ukraine in 1920 he was met by a Red Army offensive that drove into Polish territory almost to Warsaw. However Pilsudski halted the Soviet advance at the and resumed the offensive. The ""Peace of Riga"" signed in early 1921 split the territory of the Transcaucasian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic and the Byelorussian and Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republics signed a Treaty of Creation of the USSR forming the Soviet Union by a conference of the representatives which was confirmed on December 30 1922 by the First Congress of Soviets of the USSR. entailed the breakup of the landed estates and the forcible seizure of agricultural surpluses. The signaled the growing unpopularity of War Communism in the countryside: in March 1921 at the end of the civil war primarily peasants who initially had been stalwart supporters of the Bolsheviks under the provisional government revolted against the new regime. Although the Red Army crossed the ice over the frozen this sign of growing discontent forced the party to foster a broad alliance of the working class and peasantry (80 percent of the population) although left-wing factions of the party favored a regime solely representative of the interests of the revolutionary proletariat. Lenin replaced War Communism with the New Economic Policy (NEP) which reintroduced a limited market. Small private businesses were allowed and restrictions on political activity were eased somewhat. The key shift involved the status of agricultural surpluses. Rather than simply requisitioning agricultural surpluses in order to feed the urban population (the hallmark of War Communism) the NEP allowed peasants to sell their surplus yields on the open market. Meanwhile the state still maintained ownership of what Lenin deemed the ""commanding heights"" of the economy: heavy industry along with the banking and financial components of the economy. The ""commanding heights"" employed the majority of the workers in the urban areas. Under the NEP such state industries would be largely free to make their own economic decisions. The Soviet NEP (1921–1929) was essentially a period of ""market socialism"" similar to the Dengist reforms in Communist China after 1978 employing both private entrepreneurs and limited markets based on trade and pricing rather than fully centralized planning. (During the first meeting in the early 1980s between industrialist and prominent investor in Lenin's Soviet Union Deng pressed Hammer for as much information on the NEP as possible.) agricultural yields not only recovered to the levels attained before the Bolshevik Revolution but greatly improved. The breakup of the quasi-feudal landed estates of the Tsarist-era countryside gave the peasantry incentive to maximize production. Able to sell their surpluses on the open market peasant spending boosted the manufacturing sectors in the urban areas. As a result of the NEP and the breakup of the landed estates during the Communist party consolidation of power between 1917 and 1921 the Soviet Union became the world's greatest grain producer. would recover from civil war more rapidly than heavy industry. Factories badly damaged by civil war and capital depreciation were far less productive. In addition the organization of enterprises into trusts or syndicates representing one particular sector of the economy contributed to imbalances between supply and demand associated with monopolies. Due to the lack of incentives brought by market competition and with little or no state controls on their internal policies The slower recovery of industry posed problems for the peasantry who accounted for 80 percent of the population. Since agriculture was relatively more productive relative price indexes for industrial goods were higher than those of agricultural products. This resulted in what Trotsky called the ""scissors crisis"" because of the scissors-like shape of the graph representing shifts in relative price indices. Forced to produce more and more grain to purchase consumer goods from the urban areas some peasants withheld agricultural surpluses in anticipation of higher prices contributing to mild shortages in the cities. This speculative market behavior was frowned upon by many Communist party cadres In the meantime the party took constructive steps to offset the crisis attempting to bring down prices for manufactured goods and stabilize by imposing price controls on key industrial goods and breaking up the trusts in order to increase economic efficiency. The death of Lenin and the fate of the NEP Faction fighting in the Communist party Since succession mechanisms had not been established in party procedure Lenin's death in 1924 heightened fierce factional fighting in the party over the fate of the NEP. The Left Opposition within the party had long opposed the NEP for various ideological and practical reasons (the market system was beginning to create negative results typical of capitalism: and the rise of a wealthy class). They used the ""Scissors Crisis"" to gain ideological capital over the right wing of the party (supportive of the NEP) led by Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin. But while the left and right were fighting over economic policy and Marxist theory For more on the succession battle within the party see Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In order to devise a pretext for abandoning the NEP Stalin moved to exploit the problems associated with the ""Scissors Crisis "" cynically adopting Trotsky's arguments. He vilified the ""Nepmen"" (small retailers profiting off the growing urban-rural trade) and Kulaks (the emerging upper-middle class of wealthy peasant farmers) under the NEP as new capitalistic classes. He cynically adopted the arguments used by his enemies in the Left Opposition focusing on the so-called evils of the market such as inflation and unemployment. Stalin united with the Bukharinite faction of the party to defeat Trotsky who Stalin considered to be a greater potential rival because of his charisma. With Trotsky safely exiled he turned against the right-wing supporters of NEP in order to consolidate his control over the party and the state. He adapted the ""leftist"" stance that opposed market agriculture because they wanted to produce the material basis for communism quickly despite unfavorable conditions. But he also endorsed the ""rightist"" faction's notion of ""socialism in one country "" which favored concentrating on internal development rather than exporting revolution. In that respect he also favored extensive exports of grain and raw materials; the revenues from foreign exchange allowing the Soviet Union to import foreign technologies needed for industrial development. Stalin first formed a troika with Zinoviev and with Trotsky marginalized and removed from his position as People's Commissar of War and a member of the Politburo Stalin joined with Bukharin against his former allies. Then he turned against the NEP into opposition and leaving Stalin as the dominant figure in the party and the country. Stalin had a reputation as a revolutionary "" and Lenin's ""right hand man."" However in reality Lenin had distrusted Stalin and before his death had written a letter often referred to as Lenin's Testament warning against giving power to Stalin "" and ""capricious.""

Located near the center of the far side of Earth's Moon its diameter is about 58 miles (93 km). : αστρονομία = άστρον + νόμος ) is the science of celestial phenomena that originate outside . It gives us the context for our existence in an evolving universe of untold numbers of galaxies and complex structures at all scales. It studies the origins and chemical properties of celestial objects. In short astronomy is about finding out what is going on beyond Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences with a scientific methodology existing at the time of and advanced observation techniques possibly much earlier as seen in the study of archaeoastronomy. In ancient cultures astronomical observations were often connected to religious thought a remnant of which we find in The earliest observations of the heavens were by naked eye but even this method allows the celestial objects to be cataloged and assigned to . A knowledge of the constellations has been an important navigational tool since the earliest times. The emergence of astronomy as a science following the scientific method is very important to the development of science in general. It was through astronomy with the development of the heliocentric ( that we find the early seeds of conflict between Christian thought and science (see Astronomy is one of the few sciences where amateurs can still play an active role Astronomy is one of the few sciences where amateurs can still play an active role especially in the discovery and monitoring of transient phenomena. whose work led to the development of celestial mechanics mathematically predicting the motions of celestial bodies interacting under gravity objects in particular. Much of the effort in these two areas—once done largely by hand—is highly automated nowadays to the extent that they are rarely considered as independent disciplines anymore. Motions and positions of objects are now more easily determined and modern astronomy is more concerned with observing and understanding the actual physical nature of celestial objects. the field of professional astronomy has split into observational astronomy and theoretical astrophysics. Although most astronomers incorporate elements of both into their research because of the different skills involved most professional astronomers tend to specialize in one or the other. Observational astronomy is concerned mostly with acquiring data which involves building and maintaining instruments and processing the resulting information; this branch is at times referred to as ""astrometry"" or simply as ""astronomy."" Theoretical astrophysics is concerned mainly with ascertaining the observational implications of different models and involves working with computer or analytic models. The fields of study can also be categorized in other ways. Categorization by the region of space under study (for example such as star formation or cosmology; or by the method used for obtaining information. or Planetary Sciences: a dust devil on . Photographed by Mars Global Surveyor the long dark streak is formed by a moving swirling column of Martian atmosphere (with similarities to a terrestrial ). The dust devil itself (the black spot) is climbing the crater wall. The streaks on the right are sand dunes on the crater floor. : the study of the position of objects in the sky and their changes of position. Defines the system of coordinates used and the kinematics of objects in our galaxy. : the study of physics of the universe including the physical properties (luminosity Cosmology: the study of the origin of the universe and its evolution. The study of cosmology is theoretical astrophysics at its largest scale. Galaxy formation and evolution: the study of the formation of the galaxies Galactic astronomy: the study of the structure and components of our galaxy and of other galaxies. Extragalactic astronomy: the study of objects (mainly galaxies) outside our galaxy. Stellar astronomy: the study of the stars. Stellar evolution: the study of the evolution of stars from their formation to their end as a stellar remnant. Star formation: the study of the condition and processes that led to the formation of stars in the interior of gas clouds and the process of formation itself. Astrobiology: the study of the advent and evolution of biological systems in the Universe. Other disciplines that may be considered part of astronomy: Radio telescopes are among many different tools used by astronomers is mainly received from the detection and analysis of but information is also carried by gravitational waves (see LIGO and LISA). A traditional division of astronomy is given by the region of the Optical astronomy is the part of astronomy that uses specialized equipment to detect and analyze that can be detected with the (about 400 - 800 nm). The most common tool is the telescope with electronic imagers and spectrographs. deals with the detection and analysis of infrared radiation (wavelengths longer than red light). The most common tool is the telescope but with the instrument optimized for infrared. are also used to eliminate noise (electromagnetic interference) from the atmosphere. detects radiation of millimeter to decameter wavelength. The receivers are similar to those used in broadcast transmission but much more sensitive. See also Radio telescopes. and extreme UV (ultraviolet) astronomy as well as studies of neutrinos and cosmic rays. Optical and radio astronomy can be performed with ground-based is transparent at the wavelengths being detected. Infrared light is heavily absorbed by water vapor so infrared observatories have to be located in high dry places or in space. The atmosphere is opaque at the wavelengths used by UV astronomy and (except for a few wavelength ""windows"") Far infrared astronomy so observations must be carried out mostly from however be detected by the large air showers they produce can also be regarded as a branch of astronomy. Extragalactic astronomy: gravitational lensing. This image shows several blue loop-shaped objects that are multiple images of the same galaxy duplicated by the gravitational lens effect of the cluster of yellow galaxies near the photograph's center. The lens is produced by the cluster's gravitational field that bends light to magnify and distort the image of a more distant object. astronomy only comprised the observation and predictions of the motions of the naked-eye objects. Aristotle said that the Earth was the center of the Universe and everything rotated around it in orbits that were perfect circles. Aristotle had to be right because people thought that Earth had to be in the center with everything rotating around it because the wind would not scatter leaves and birds would only fly in one direction. For a long time people thought that Aristotle was right but now some people think that Aristotle accidentally did more to hinder our knowledge than help it. associated with the motions of the sun and also the 12 zodiacal divisions of the sky. The ancient Greeks made important contributions to astronomy among them the definition of the magnitude system. The Bible contains a number of statements on the position of the earth in the universe and the nature of the stars and planets most of which are poetic rather than literal; see Biblical cosmology. In 500 presented a mathematical system that described the earth as spinning on its axis and considered the motions of the planets with respect to the sun. Observational astronomy was mostly stagnant in world and other parts of Islamic realm. In the late ninth century Persian astronomer al-Farghani wrote extensively on the motion of celestial bodies. His work was translated into Latin in the twelfth century. In the late tenth century by the Persian astronomer al-Khujandi who observed a series of meridian transits of the Sun which allowed him to calculate the obliquity of the performed a reformation of the calendar that was more accurate than the Julian Calendar and came close to the Gregorian. Abraham Zacuto was responsible in the fifteenth century for the adaptations of astronomical theory for the practical needs of Portuguese caravel expeditions. proposed a heliocentric model of the . Galileo added the innovation of using telescopes to enhance his observations. Kepler was the first to devise a system that described correctly the details of the motion of the planets with the Sun at the center. However Kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down. It was left to invention of celestial dynamics and his law of universal gravitation to finally explain the motions of the . Newton also developed the reflecting telescope. Stars were found to be faraway objects. With the advent of spectroscopy it was proved that they were similar to our own sun but with a wide range of temperatures and sizes. The existence of our as a separate group of stars was only proven in the twentieth century along with the existence of ""external"" galaxies the expansion of the universe seen in the recession of most galaxies from us. Modern astronomy has also discovered many exotic objects such as and has used these observations to develop physical theories which describe some of these objects in terms of equally exotic objects such as black holes and . Physical cosmology made huge advances during the twentieth century with the model of the heavily supported by the evidence provided by astronomy and physics and cosmological abundances of elements.

1620763322.7515562,71715058,https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Earth%27s_atmosphere,"is a layer of gases surrounding our planet and retained by the Earth's gravity. It contains roughly 78 percent and other gases. This mixture of gases is commonly known as the atmosphere is divided into several layers but it has no abrupt outermost boundary. It slowly becomes thinner and fades away into in a variety of ways. It provides oxygen for respiration and water vapor for precipitation that nourishes the land. Carbon dioxide and water vapor reduce temperature extremes between keeping the planet warm enough for living organisms. The ozone layer absorbs solar radiation that could damage living tissue and higher layers protect the Earth from bombardment by meteorites and charged particles in the solar wind. is that human activities such as fuel burning and industrial production have been releasing pollutants into the atmosphere. In response the governments of various nations have instituted measures to reduce the emission of pollutants. The properties of the Earth's atmosphere vary with altitude. Based on these properties the atmosphere may be regarded as having different layers or zones. According to one system of nomenclature there are five layers: the . The boundaries between these regions are called the = ball) is the atmosphere's lowest and densest layer and it is also known as the . It starts from the Earth's surface and reaches up to about 7 km (4.35 miles) at the poles and 17 km (10.5 miles) at the equator with some variation caused by weather factors. The upper boundary of this layer is called the The troposphere has a great deal of vertical mixing of its constituent as a result of solar heat. As the the air masses near the surface become warmer and release heat. That process further buoys the air masses. This sequence continues until all the water vapor in the air is removed. The temperature of the troposphere decreases with height. At middle latitudes the temperature drops from about +17° C (62° F)at sea level to about -52° C (-62° F) at the beginning of the tropopause. At the poles the troposphere is thinner and the temperature falls to only -45° C (-49° F) the temperature at the top of the troposphere can reach -75° C (-103° F). = spread or bed) is situated directly above the troposphere and just below the mesosphere. In terms of its altitude range it lies between about 10 km and 50 km at moderate latitudes but it starts at about 8 km at the poles. This layer is dynamically stable with no regular mixing of air and associated turbulence. The stratosphere is stratified (layered) in temperature with warmer layers higher up and cooler layers farther down—the reverse of the temperature variation in the troposphere. The upper layers of the stratosphere are heated by the presence of an —radiation that would otherwise be harmful to living organisms on Earth. The (at the top of the stratosphere) has a temperature of about 270 —fairly close to the temperature at ground level. The base of the stratosphere occurs where heating by conduction from above and convection from below (through the troposphere) balance out. The stratosphere begins at lower altitudes near the poles because the ground temperatures are lower there. Commercial airliners typically cruise at an altitude near 10 km in temperate latitudes in the lower reaches of the stratosphere. In this manner they avoid the atmospheric turbulence that occurs in the troposphere. = middle) is the layer between about 50 km and about 80–85 km above the Earth's surface. It is sandwiched between the stratosphere and the thermosphere. The temperature in this layer decreases with increasing altitude and can be as low as 200 varying according to latitude and Given that it lies between the maximum altitude for most and the minimum altitude for most this region of the atmosphere is directly accessible only through the use of sounding rockets. As a result it is one of the most poorly understood regions of the atmosphere. burn up daily in the mesosphere as a result of collisions with the gas particles contained there leading to a high concentration of and other metal atoms. The collisions almost always create enough heat to burn the falling objects long before they reach the ground. Thus the mesosphere protects the Earth from a barrage of would-be meteorites. The stratosphere and mesosphere are referred to as the . Regions above the mesosphere are called the at an altitude of about 80 km separates the mesosphere from the thermosphere. The mesopause lies near the the band below which different chemical species are well mixed by turbulent eddies. for heat) extends from an altitude of 80–85 km to 640+ km. It lies directly above the mesosphere and right below the exosphere. the residual atmospheric gases sort into strata according to their molecular masses. The temperature in this layer increases with altitude due to the absorption of extremely energetic solar radiation by the small amount of present. Temperatures are highly dependent on solar activity and can rise to 2 000° C. Solar radiation causes the air particles in this layer to become ionized Astronauts travel at altitudes that exceed 80 km (50 miles) which means that they travel within or go beyond the thermosphere. An altitude of 120 km (75 miles) marks the boundary where atmospheric effects become noticeable during re-entry. = out or outside) is the uppermost layer of the atmosphere. Its lower boundary at the edge of the thermosphere is estimated to be 500 km to 1 000 km above the Earth's surface and its upper boundary at about 10 It is only from the exosphere that atmospheric . The main gases in the exosphere are the lightest ones with some atomic oxygen near the exobase (the lowest altitude of the exosphere). The few particles of gas here can reach 2 The atmosphere in this layer is sufficiently rarified for although they still receive some atmospheric drag. The exact altitude at which the exosphere ends and space begins is not well-defined and attempting to attach a specific value to it is not particularly useful. Atmospheric regions are also named in other ways in an altitude range of about 10–50 km the concentration of ozone (O ) is a few parts per million which is much higher than the ozone concentration in the lower atmosphere (although it is still small compared to the main components of the atmosphere). This layer known as the ozone layer is vitally important to life because it absorbs biologically harmful UV radiation from the Sun. Moreover the absorbed solar energy raises the temperature of this part of the atmosphere creating a thermal barrier that helps trap the atmosphere below preventing it from bleeding out into space. : This is the region of the atmosphere that contains ions (that form a ""plasma"") created by the interaction of solar radiation with gas particles. The ionosphere overlaps with the mesosphere and thermosphere going up to an altitude of 550 km. Its value in practical terms is that it enables the propagation of radio wave signals which bounce off the ions and can be transmitted to distant places on the Earth. : It is the region where the Earth's magnetic field interacts with the . Its inner boundary is the ionosphere but it extends for tens of thousands of kilometers with a long tail away from the Sun. : These are regions where charged particles (forming a ) from the solar wind are trapped by the Earth's "" particles strike the upper atmosphere and producing the effects known as the polar auroras. Qualitatively there are two belts: an inner belt : The region below the turbopause (that is below an altitude of about 100 km) is known as the where the chemical constituents are well mixed and the composition of the atmosphere remains fairly uniform (see . The region above the turbopause is called the in the absence of mixing the chemical composition of the atmosphere varies (see Atmospheric pressure (or barometric pressure) is a direct result of the weight of the air. It is highest at the Earth's surface and decreases with altitude. This is because air at the surface is compressed by the weight of all the air above it. Air pressure varies with location and time because the amount (and weight) of air above the Earth varies with location and time. Atmospheric pressure drops by approximately 50 percent at an altitude of about 5 km. (In other words about 50 percent of the total atmospheric mass is within the lowest 5 km). The average atmospheric pressure at sea level is about 101.3 kilopascals (about 14.7 pounds per square inch). The density of air at sea level is about 1.2 kg/m and it decreases as altitude increases. The average mass of the atmosphere is about 5 57.8 percent of the atmosphere is below the summit of 72 percent of the atmosphere is below the common cruising altitude of commercial airliners (about 10 99.99999 percent of the atmosphere is below the highest flight altitude of the aircraft X-15 300 ft (108 km) on August 22 most of the atmosphere (99.9999 percent) is below 100 km although in the rarified region above this there are The atmosphere exists at altitudes of 1 but it is so thin as to be considered nonexistent.

The NASA total was 17 ppmv over 100% was increased here by 15 ppmv. To normalize should be reduced by about 25 ppmv and O Minor components of air not listed above include: Above the turbopause (about 100 km) the Earth's atmosphere begins to have a composition that varies with altitude. This is essentially because in the absence of mixing the density of a gas falls off exponentially with increasing altitude at a rate that depends on the molecular mass of the gas. Higher mass constituents such as oxygen and nitrogen fall off more quickly than lighter constituents such as as the altitude increases in the heterosphere the atmosphere is dominated successively by helium and atomic hydrogen. The precise altitude of the heterosphere and the layers it contains varies significantly with temperature The Earth's atmosphere plays a vital role in sustaining life on this planet. Oxygen is needed for respiration by animals and some bacteria. Nitrogen is an inert gas that reduces the amount of oxygen available for the oxidation of natural materials thus restricting spontaneous combustion (burning) of flammable materials and the corrosion of metals. Nitrogen is also used by ""nitrogen-fixing"" bacteria to produce compounds that are useful for plant growth. Plants that perform photosynthesis take up carbon dioxide from the air and release oxygen. Carbon dioxide and water vapor act as ""greenhouse gases"" that keep the Earth sufficiently warm to maintain life. Water vapor in the air is part of the water cycle that produces precipitation (such as rain and snow) that replenishes moisture in the soil. In addition water vapor prevents exposed living tissue from drying up. several regions of the atmosphere exert their protective effect from a distance. For instance the ozone layer absorbs UV radiation that can damage the tissues and genetic material of living organisms. The mesosphere in which millions of meteors burn up daily protects the Earth's surface from being continually bombarded by these falling objects. The magnetosphere which extends well beyond the atmosphere protects the Earth from the damaging rain of charged particles carried by the solar wind. The history of the Earth's atmosphere prior to one billion years ago is poorly understood but one plausible sequence of events is given below. The modern atmosphere is sometimes referred to as Earth's ""third atmosphere "" to distinguish its chemical composition from two notably different earlier compositions. It is thought that the original atmosphere was primarily (from the still-molten crust and the Sun) dissipated this atmosphere. the surface had cooled sufficiently to form a solid crust . This led to formation of the ""second atmosphere "" composed primarily of carbon dioxide and water vapor . (Simulations run at the University of Waterloo and University of Colorado in 2005 suggested that it may have had up to 40 percent hydrogen ). This second atmosphere had approximately 100 times as much as the current atmosphere. It is generally believed that the caused by high levels of carbon dioxide kept the Earth from freezing. During the next few million years which began to dissolve carbon dioxide. Approximately 50 percent of the carbon dioxide was absorbed into the oceans. were among the earliest types of bacterial life existing approximately 3.3 billion years ago. They were the first organisms to carry out the photosynthetic conversion of carbon dioxide into oxygen thus playing a major role in transforming the atmosphere from an anoxic state (a state without oxygen) to an oxic state (a state with oxygen). Oxygenation of the atmosphere is thought to have led to mass extinctions of species. plants emerged and converted more carbon dioxide into oxygen. Over time excess carbon became locked into fossil fuels and animal shells. As oxygen was released it reacted with ammonia to generate nitrogen. In addition the levels of oxygen increased significantly while carbon dioxide levels dropped. At first the oxygen combined with various but eventually oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere. With the appearance of an forms were better protected from UV radiation. This oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere is the ""third atmosphere.""

Although technological advances have benefited humankind in numerous ways they have been accompanied by adverse effects on the environment including pollution of the air. Common air pollutants include and particulate matter (PM). They are generally produced by such activities as (a) combustion (burning) of fuels for transportation and the generation of heat and electricity a product of the incomplete combustion of fuels is present at relatively high concentrations near roadways with heavy vehicular traffic. Inhalation of high levels of carbon monoxide can cause headaches and (in extreme cases) death. Among the various oxides of nitrogen ) causes respiratory problems and contributes to acid rain. Nitrogen oxides also contribute to the formation of particulate matter in the air and nutrient overload in ponds and lakes Various oxides of sulfur are formed by the burning of sulfur-containing fuels and also during the extraction of metals from ores and gasoline from oil. When dissolved in water sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide form acids contributing to acid rain. They also damage the respiratory system and contribute to the formation of particles that reduce visibility in the air. nitrogen oxides can react with volatile organic compounds (such as gasoline vapors and chemical solvents) to produce ozone. Although ozone in the stratosphere exerts a protective effect by absorbing harmful UV radiation ozone in the troposphere can irritate the lungs and cause inflammation and breathing difficulties. Repeated exposure to ozone can permanently damage the lungs. Ozone is a major component of city smog. Particulate matter is a mixture of a variety of microscopic solids and liquid droplets and dust. The main concern is for small particles with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less as they can readily enter the lungs during the normal process of breathing. Particle pollution is linked to various problems Lead in the air is produced mainly by lead smelters and also by waste incinerators and lead-acid battery manufacturing plants. Exposure to lead can damage various body organs and can cause osteoporosis and reproductive disorders. To reduce the emission and accumulation of such pollutants the governments of various nations have mandated measures such as the use of reformulated gasoline catalytic converters in motor vehicle exhaust systems and effluent traps for industrial wastes. In addition to the problem of pollution there is concern that global temperatures are rising as a result of increasing levels of greenhouse gases—such as carbon dioxide and methane—in the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases generally play a valuable role in that they absorb some of the Sun's heat and help keep the Earth warm and habitable. The concern is that a rise in the level of these gases is leading to the phenomenon of ""global warming."" Many scientists associate this rise with human activities such as the burning of fuels and agriculture. Others attribute global warming to increasing solar activity or other natural phenomena. In addition the extent of warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions is being debated. The thermosphere: a part of the heterosphere writers and editors rewrote and completed the .

1620763350.333173,38992816,https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Ancient_Greece,"The ancient Greek world circa 550 is the period in Greek history that lasted for around one thousand years and ended with the rise of Christianity. It is considered by most historians to be the foundational of Western civilization. Greek culture was a powerful influence in the which carried a version of it to many parts of Europe. The civilization of the ancient Greeks has been immensely influential on the language in western Europe and again resurgent during various neoclassical revivals in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Europe and the Americas. Greek thought continues to inform discussion of and theology. The notion of and some of the basic institutions of democratic governance are derived from the Athenian model. The word ""Ancient Greece"" is the term used to describe the Greek-speaking world in ancient times. It refers not only to the geographical peninsula of modern but also to areas of Hellenic culture that were settled in ancient times by Greeks: the Aegean coast of Anatolia (then known as Ionia) and the scattered Greek settlements on the coasts of Colchis east and northeast of the Iberian peninsula Iberia and Taurica. Largely due to the way in which the Roman Empire borrowed and built on classical Greek culture and learning Greek culture became part of the heritage of Europe and became intertwined with Christianity. It continues to be the foundation of much human thought across many spheres. Greek influence stands behind so many aspects of contemporary life that it is difficult to imagine what life would have been like had the ancient artistic and intellectual life of Greece not flourished as it did. At the same time that some of the great Greek thinkers were flourishing and others were also enlightening humanity elsewhere in the world. theory posits that something very special was taking place at this time laying the ethical and moral foundations that humanity needed in order to become what humanity is intended to be moral agents in a world over which they have responsibility for its welfare. There are no fixed or universally agreed upon dates for the beginning or the end of the ancient Greek period. In common usage it refers to all Greek history before the but historians use the term more precisely. Some writers include the periods of the Greek-speaking Mycenaean civilization that collapsed about 1150 though most would argue that the influential Minoan culture was so different from later Greek cultures that it should be classed separately. from the period of around one thousand years ending with the rise of Christianity is considered the foundation of Western civilization ""ancient times"" is a period of about 900 years until the conquest of the country by the Romans that is divided in four periods based on styles of art as much as and politics. The historical line starts with Greek Dark Ages (1100–800 artists used geometrical schemes such as squares and lines to decorate amphoras and other pottery. The archaic period (800–500 ) represents those years when the artists made larger free-standing sculptures in stiff hieratic poses with the dreamlike ""archaic smile."" In the classical period (500–323 artists perfected the style that since has been taken as exemplary: ""classical "" such as the Parthenon. In the Hellenistic years that followed the conquests of aspects of Hellenic civilization expanded to the ancient Greek period was taken to begin with the date of the first but many historians now extend the term back to about 1000 The traditional date for the end of the ancient Greek period is the death of The following period is classed Hellenistic or the integration of Greece into the Roman Republic in 146 These dates are historians' conventions and some writers treat the ancient Greek civilization as a continuum running until the advent of Christianity in the third century. The Greeks are believed to have migrated southward into the Balkan peninsula in several waves beginning in the late third millennium the last being the Dorian invasion. Proto-Greek is assumed to date to some time between the twenty-third and seventeenth centuries which is known for the reign of King Agamemnon and the wars against as narrated in the epics of is a ""Dark Age"" from which no primary texts survive evidence remains. Secondary and tertiary texts such as contain brief chronologies and king lists for this period. The history of ancient Greece is often taken to end with the reign of Any history of ancient Greece requires a cautionary note on sources. Those Greek historians and political writers whose works have survived or pro-Athenian. That is why more is known about the and politics of Athens than of any other city and why almost nothing is known about some cities' histories. These writers concentrate almost wholly on political and ignore economic and social history. All histories of ancient Greece have to contend with these limits in their sources. The Minoans were a group of people who lived on the island of Crete in the eastern during the Bronze Age. They are named after the famous King Minos said to be the son of . Several ""palace"" settlements started to appear on the island around 2000 the most famous of which is the city of . The Minoan settlements were discovered by the in 1900. Little is known about Minoan life and Minoan art is very unique and easily recognizable. Wall frescos are frequent and often portray nautical themes with ships and in Knossos there are many images and statues of bull horns and female figures over which scholars debate the meaning. The myth of King Minos and the Minotaur is a well-known early . Minos was said to be the son of Zeus and Europa. In order to ensure his claim of the domain over Crete and Knossos for affirmation of his rule in return for a sacrifice. Poseidon sent down a bull as a symbol but Minos did not hold up his end of the bargain. As punishment to lust after a bull. She mated with a bull by hiding in an artificial cow and gave birth to the half-bull Minos shut him away in a maze called the Labyrinth. Later Theseus slew the Minotaur to save his city The Mycenaeans are thought to have developed after the Minoan settlements on Crete were destroyed. Mycenae the city after which the people are named is located on mainland Greece Greece began to emerge from the Dark Ages that followed the fall of the Mycenaean civilization. Literacy had been lost and the Mycenaean script forgotten but the Greeks created the Greek alphabet most likely by modifying the Phoenician alphabet. From about 800 written records begin to appear. Greece was divided into many small self-governing communities a pattern dictated by Greek geography and plain is cut off from its neighbors by the sea or mountain ranges. its population grew beyond the capacity of its limited arable land (according to Mogens Herman Hansen the population of ancient Greece increased by a factor larger than ten during the period from 800 increasing from a population of 700 000 to a total estimated population of 8 to 10 million.) the Greeks began 250 years of expansion settling colonies in all directions. To the east coast of Asia Minor was colonized first and south coast of the . Eventually Greek colonization reached as far northeast as present-day followed by the south coast of . Greek colonies were also founded in had their beginnings as the Greek colonies Syracusa the Greek world had become a and linguistic area much larger than the geographical area of present Greece. Greek colonies were not politically controlled by their founding cities links with them. The Greeks both at home and abroad organized themselves into independent communities ) became the basic unit of Greek government. a huge economic development occurred in Greece and its overseas colonies with the growth of commerce and manufacture. There also was a large improvement in the living standards of the population. Some studies estimate that the average size of the Greek household in the period from 800 which indicates a large increase in the average income of the population. By the economic height of ancient Greece Greece was the most advanced economy in the world. According to some economic historians it was one of the most advanced pre-industrial economies. This is demonstrated by the average daily wage of the Greek worker in terms of grain (about 13 kg) more than 4 times the average daily wage of the Egyptian worker (about 3 kg). although many of them were very small and the term ) for their rulers is misleadingly grand. In a country always short of farmland power rested with a small class of landowners who formed a warrior aristocracy fighting frequent petty inter-city wars over land and rapidly ousting the monarchy. About this time the rise of a mercantile class (shown by the introduction of coinage in about 680 ) introduced class conflict into the larger cities. From 650 the aristocracies had to fight not to be overthrown and replaced by populist leaders called tyrants ( a word that did not necessarily have the modern meaning of oppressive dictators. several cities had emerged as dominant in Greek affairs: and Thebes. Each of them had brought the surrounding rural areas and smaller towns under their control and Athens and Corinth had become major maritime and mercantile powers as well. Athens and Sparta developed a rivalry that dominated Greek politics for generations. the landed aristocracy retained their power and the constitution of Lycurgus (about 650 ) entrenched their power and gave Sparta a permanent militarist regime under a dual monarchy. Sparta dominated the other cities of the Peloponnese with the sole exceptions of Argus and Achaia. the monarchy was abolished in 683 and reforms of Solon established a moderate system of aristocratic government. The aristocrats were followed by the tyranny of Pisistratus and his sons who made the city a great naval and commercial power. When the Pisistratids were overthrown Cleisthenes established the world's first with power being held by an assembly of all the male citizens. But it must be remembered that only a minority of the male inhabitants were citizens In Ionia (the modern Aegean coast of which included great centers such as Miletus and Halicarnassus were unable to maintain their independence and came under the rule of the Persian Empire in the mid-sixth century the Greeks rose in the Ionian Revolt and Athens and some other Greek cities went to their aid. having suppressed the Ionian cities sent a fleet to punish the Greeks. The Persians landed in Attica but were defeated at the by a Greek army led by the Athenian general Miltiades. The burial mound of the Athenian dead can still be seen at Marathon. sent a much more powerful force by land. After being delayed by the Spartan King Leonidas I at the Battle of Thermopylae where he captured and burned Athens. But the Athenians had evacuated the city by sea and under Themistocles they defeated the Persian fleet at the Battle of Salamis. A year later under the Spartan Pausanius defeated the Persian army at Plataea. The Athenian fleet then turned to chasing the Persians out of the Aegean Sea they captured Byzantium. In the course of doing so Athens enrolled all the island states and some mainland allies into an alliance called the Delian League because its treasury was kept on the sacred island of Delos. The Spartans although they had taken part in the war withdrew into isolation after it allowing Athens to establish unchallenged naval and commercial power. ushered in a century of Athenian dominance of Greek affairs. Athens was the unchallenged master of the sea and also the leading commercial power although Corinth remained a serious rival. The leading statesman of this time was who used the tribute paid by the members of the Delian League to build the Parthenon and other great monuments of classical Athens. By the mid-fifth century the league had become an Athenian Empire symbolized by the transfer of the league's treasury from Delos to the Parthenon in 454 The wealth of Athens attracted talented people from all over Greece and also created a wealthy leisure class who became patrons of the arts. The Athenian state also sponsored learning and the arts particularly architecture. Athens became the center of Greek literature and the arts. Some of the greatest names of Western cultural and intellectual history lived in Athens during this period: the dramatists and the sculptor Pheidias. The city became The other Greek states at first accepted Athenian leadership in the continuing war against the Persians but after the fall of the conservative politician Cimon in 461 Athens became an increasingly open imperialist power. After the Greek victory at the Battle of the Eurymedon in 466 the Persians were no longer a threat tried to secede from the league but were forced to submit. The new Athenian leaders and Ephialtes let relations between Athens and Sparta deteriorate war broke out. After some years of inconclusive war a 30-year peace was signed between the Delian League and the Peloponnesian League (Sparta and her allies). This coincided with the last battle between the Greeks and the Persians a sea battle off Salamis in followed by the Peace of Callias (450 ) between the Greeks and Persians. war broke out again between Athens and Sparta and its allies. The immediate causes of the vary from account to account. However three causes are fairly consistent among the ancient historians Corinth and one of its colonies got into a dispute in which Athens intervened. Soon after Corinth and Athens argued over control of Potidaea (near modern-day Nea Potidaia) eventually leading to an Athenian siege of the Potidaea. Finally Athens issued a series of economic decrees known as the ""Megarian Decrees"" that placed economic sanctions on the Megarian people. Athens was accused by the Peloponnesian allies of violating the Thirty Years Peace through all of the aforementioned actions and Sparta formally declared war on Athens. It should be noted that many historians consider these simply to be the immediate causes of the war. They would argue that the underlying cause was the growing resentment of Sparta and its allies at the dominance of Athens over Greek affairs. The war lasted 27 years partly because Athens (a naval power) and Sparta (a land-based military power) found it difficult to come to grips with each other. Sparta's initial strategy was to invade Attica but the Athenians were able to retreat behind their walls. An outbreak of plague in the city during the siege caused heavy losses the Athenian fleet landed troops in the Peloponnese winning battles at Naupactus (429 ). But these tactics could bring neither side a decisive victory. After several years of inconclusive campaigning the moderate Athenian leader Nicias concluded the Peace of Nicias (421 hostility between Sparta and the Athenian ally Argos led to a resumption of fighting. At Mantinea Sparta defeated the combined armies of Athens and her allies. The resumption of fighting brought the war party back to power in Athens. In 415 Alcibiades persuaded the Athenian Assembly to launch a major expedition against Syracuse . Though Nicias was a skeptic about the Sicilian Expedition he was appointed along Alcibiades to lead the expedition. Due to accusations against him where he persuaded Sparta to send aid to Syracuse. As a result the expedition was a complete disaster and the whole expeditionary force was lost. Nicias was executed by his captors. Sparta had now built a fleet (with the help of the Persians) to challenge Athenian naval supremacy and had found a brilliant military leader in Lysander who seized the strategic initiative by occupying the Hellespont Athens sent its last remaining fleet to confront Lysander who decisively defeated them at Aegospotami (405 ). The loss of her fleet threatened Athens with and Sparta dictated a predictably stern settlement: Athens lost her city walls and all of her overseas possessions. The anti- party took power in Athens with Spartan support. The end of the Peloponnesian War left Sparta the master of Greece but the narrow outlook of the Spartan warrior elite did not suit them to this role. Within a few years party regained power in Athens and other cities. In 395 the Spartan rulers removed Lysander from office and Sparta lost her naval supremacy. the latter two formerly Spartan allies challenged Spartan dominance in the Corinthian War which ended inconclusively in 387 Sparta shocked Greek opinion by concluding the Treaty of Antalcidas with Persia by which they surrendered the Greek cities of Ionia and Cyprus; thus they reversed a hundred years of Greek victories against Persia. Sparta then tried to further weaken the power of Thebes which led to a war where Thebes formed an alliance with the old enemy The Theban generals Epaminondas and Pelopidas won a decisive victory at Leuctra (371 ). The result of this battle was the end of Spartan supremacy and the establishment of Theban dominance but Athens herself recovered much of her former power because the supremacy of Thebes was short-lived. With the death of Epaminondas at Mantinea (362 ) the city lost its greatest leader and his successors blundered into an ineffectual ten-year war with Phocis. In 346 the Thebans appealed to Philip II of Macedon to help them against the Phocians thus drawing Macedon into Greek affairs for the first time. The Kingdom of Macedon was formed in the seventh century It played little part in Greek politics before the fifth century In the beginning of the fourth century King Philip II of Macedon an ambitious man who had been educated in Thebes wanted to play a larger role. In particular he wanted to be accepted as the new leader of Greece in recovering the freedom of the Greek cities of Asia from Persian rule. By seizing the Greek cities of Amphipolis he gained control of the mines of Macedonia. This gave him the resources to realize his ambitions. Philip established Macedonian dominance over Thessaly (352 he controlled everything north of Thermopylae. He used his great wealth to bribe Greek politicians creating a ""Macedonian party"" in every Greek city. His intervention in the war between Thebes and Phocis brought him great recognition and gave him his opportunity to become a power in Greek affairs. Against him in a series of famous speeches (philippics) roused the Athenians to resist Philip's advance. Thebes and Athens formed an alliance to resist Philip's growing influence. Philip struck first advancing into Greece and defeating the allies at Chaeronea in 338 This traditionally marks the start of the decline of the city-state institution though they mostly survived as independent states until Roman times. Philip tried to win over the Athenians by flattery and gifts but these efforts met with limited success. He organized the cities into the League of Corinth and announced that he would lead an invasion of Persia to liberate the Greek cities and avenge the Persian invasions of the previous century. But before he could do so Philip was succeeded by his 20-year-old son who immediately set out to carry out his father's plans. When he saw that Athens had fallen he wanted to bring back the tradition of Athens by destroying the Persian king. He traveled to Corinth where the assembled Greek cities recognized him as leader of the Greeks then set off north to assemble his forces. The core structure of his army was the hardy Macedonian mountain-fighter but he bolstered his numbers and diversified his army with levies from all corners of Greece. He enriched his tactics and formation with Greek stratagem ranging from Theban cavalry structure to Spartan tactics. His engineering and manufacturing were largely derived of Greek origin—involving everything from Archimedal siege-weaponry to Ampipholian ship-reinforcement. But while Alexander was campaigning in Thrace he heard that the Greek cities had rebelled. He swept south again and razed the city to the ground. He left only one building standing a poet who had written in favor of Alexander's ancestor Alexander the First. This acted as a symbol and warning to the Greek cities that his power could no longer be resisted while reminding them he would preserve and respect their Alexander crossed into Asia and defeated the Persians at the river Granicus. This gave him control of the Ionian coast and he made a triumphal procession through the liberated Greek cities. After settling affairs in Anatolia he advanced south through Cilicia into where he defeated Darius III at Issus (333 ). He then advanced through Phoenicia to which he captured with little resistance the Egyptians welcoming him as a liberator from Persian oppression and the prophesized son of Darius was now ready to make peace and Alexander could have returned home in triumph but Alexander was determined to conquer Persia and make himself the ruler of the world. He advanced northeast through Syria and Mesopotamia and defeated Darius again at Gaugamela (331 ). Darius fled and was killed by his own followers. Alexander found himself the master of the Persian Empire occupying Susa and Persepolis without resistance. Map of Alexander the Great's Greek empire. the Greek cities were making renewed efforts to escape from Macedonian control. At Megalopolis in 331 Alexander's regent Antipater defeated the Spartans who had refused to join the Corinthian League or recognize Macedonian supremacy. advancing through what is now he had reached Punjab. He might well have advanced down the to Bengal had not his army convinced they were at the end of the world refused to go any further. Alexander reluctantly turned back and died of a fever in Babylon in 323 Alexander's empire broke up soon after his death but his conquests permanently changed the Greek world. Thousands of Greeks traveled with him or after him to settle in the new Greek cities he had founded as he advanced the most important being Alexandria in and Bactria were established. The knowledge and cultures of east and west began to permeate and interact. The Hellenistic age had begun. The distinguishing features of ancient Greek were the division between free and slave the differing roles of men and women the relative lack of status distinctions based on birth . The way of life of the Athenians was common in the Greek world compared to Sparta's special system. Only free people could be citizens entitled to the full protection of the law in a city-state. In most city-states social prominence did not allow special rights. For example being born in a certain family generally brought no special privileges. Sometimes families controlled public but this ordinarily did not give any extra power in the government. In the population was divided into four based on wealth. People could change classes if they made more money. In all male citizens were given the title of ""equal"" if they finished their education. However who served as the city-state's dual military and religious leaders had no power or status. They had the right to have a and own property; however they had no political rights. By 600 chattel slavery had spread in Greece. By the fifth century slaves made up one-third of the total population in some city-states. Slaves outside of Sparta almost never revolted because they were made up of too many nationalities and were too scattered to organize. Most families owned slaves as household servants and laborers and even poor families might have owned one or two slaves. Owners were not allowed to beat or kill their slaves. Owners often promised to free slaves in the future to encourage slaves to work hard. Unlike in Rome slaves who were freed did not become citizens. Instead they were mixed into the population of which included people from foreign countries or other city-states who were officially allowed to live in the state. City-states also legally owned slaves. These public slaves had a larger measure of independence than slaves owned by families living on their own and performing specialized tasks. In Athens public slaves were trained to look out for while temple slaves acted as servants of the temple's deity. Sparta had a special type of slaves called Helots were Greek war captives owned by the state and assigned to families. Helots raised food and did household chores so that women could concentrate on raising strong children while men could devote their time to training as hoplites (citizen-soldiers). Their masters treated them harshly and helots often revolted. A Nubian slave of Ptolemaic Egypt (Louvre Museum) the way of life in the Greek city-states remained the same. People living in cities resided in low apartment buildings or single-family homes depending on their wealth. Residences and temples were situated around the agora. Citizens also lived in small villages and farmhouses scattered across the state's countryside. In Athens more people lived outside the city walls than inside (it is estimated that from a total population of 400 000 people lived inside the city which is a large rate of A common Greek household was simple if compared to a modern one and a kitchen situated around a small inner courtyard. Its average size about 230 square meters in the fourth century was much larger than the houses of other ancient civilizations. A household consisted of a single set of parents and their children but generally no relatives. Men were responsible for supporting the family by work or investments in land and commerce. Women were responsible for managing the household's supplies and overseeing slaves who fetched water in jugs from public fountains and looked after babies. Men kept separate rooms for entertaining guests because male visitors were not permitted in rooms where women and children spent most of their time. Wealthy men would sometimes invite friends over for a Light came from olive oil lamps while heat came from charcoal braziers. Furniture was simple and sparse The majority of Greeks worked in probably 80 percent of the entire population which is similar to all pre-industrial civilizations. The was very unpredictable. Research suggests the climate has changed little since ancient times so frequent weeding and turning of soil was needed. Oxen might have helped with plowing however most tasks would have been done by hand. The Greek farmer would ideally plan for a surplus of crops to contribute to feasts and to buy Ancient Greek food was simple as well. Poor people mainly ate and cheese or olive oil. Few people ever ate meat regularly except for the free distributions from animal sacrifices at state festivals. when eaten was mutton: ""Philochorus [third century ] relates that a prohibition was issued at Athens against anyone tasting lamb which had not been shorn… while small stands offered snacks. Wine diluted with water was a favored beverage. Greek clothing changed little over time. Both men and women wore loose Peplos and Chitons. The tunics often had colorful designs and were worn cinched with a belt. People wore cloaks and hats in cold weather and in warm weather sandals replaced leather boots. Women wore jewelry and cosmetics—especially powdered lead which gave them a pale complexion. Men grew beards until To keep fit and to be ready for men exercised daily. Almost every city-state had at least one gymnasium and park. In most cities (other than Sparta) gymnasia were open only to males and exercise was taken in the nude. City-state festivals provided great amounts of entertainment. Gods were honored with competitions in . Athenians boasted that their city hosted a festival nearly every other day. Huge Panhellenic festivals were held at Olympia and Isthmia. Athletes and musicians who won these competitions became rich and famous. The most popular and expensive competition was chariot racing. except in Sparta. During the Hellenistic period some city-states established public schools. Only wealthy families could afford a teacher. Boys learned how to read and quote literature. They also learned to sing and play one musical instrument and were trained as athletes for service. They studied not for a job but to become an effective citizen. Girls also learned to read so they could manage the household. They almost never received education after childhood. A small number of boys continued their education after childhood; one example is the Spartans (with military education). A crucial part of a wealthy teenager's education was a loving mentor relationship with an elder. The teenager learned by watching his mentor talking about politics in the helping him perform his public duties exercising with him in the gymnasium and attending symposia with him. The richest students continued their education to in a large city. These universities were organized by famous teachers. Some of Athens' greatest universities included the Lyceum and the Academy. in ancient Greece was limited if compared to modern medicine. from medical treatment in the fifth century Herbal remedies were used to reduce pain and doctors were able to perform some . But they had no cure for infections so even healthy people could die quickly from disease at any age. ) built on the work of earlier Greek scholars such as Herophilus of Chalcedon (335–280 ) to become almost synonymous with Greek medical knowledge. He became physician to the Roman emperor . His message of observation and experimentation were largely lost and his theories became dogma throughout the West. In the mid-sixteenth century his message that observation and investigation were required for through medical research began to emerge and modern methods of such research finally arose. Ancient Greece produced an impressive list of mathematicians perhaps the most famous of them being (also referred to as Euclid of Alexandria) (c. 325–265 ) who lived in Alexandria in Hellenistic Egypt. ). Their focus was on reason and their thought influenced Christian theology and the Skeptics were also very influential. The art of ancient Greece has exercised an enormous influence on the of many countries from ancient times until the present particularly in the areas of was largely derived from Greek models. In the east ’s conquests initiated several centuries of exchange between Greek with ramifications as far as the humanist aesthetic and the high technical standards of Greek art inspired generations of European artists. Well into the nineteenth century the classical tradition derived from Greece dominated the art of the Western world. The ancient Greeks were especially skilled at sculpture. The Greeks thus decided very early on that the human form was the most important subject for artistic endeavor. Seeing their gods as having human form there was no distinction between the sacred and the secular in art—the human body was both secular and sacred. A male nude could just as easily be or that year's Olympic boxing champion. In the Archaic period the most important sculptural form was the the standing male nude. The or standing clothed female figure but since Greek society did not permit the public display of female nudity until the fourth century is considered to be of less importance in the development of sculpture. It is perhaps misleading to speak of ""Greek the Greeks did not have a term for ""religion"" in the sense of a dimension of existence distinct from all others and grounded in the belief that the gods exercise authority over the fortunes of and demand recognition as a condition for salvation. The Greeks spoke of their religious doings as ""things having to do with the gods"") but this loose usage did not imply the existence of any authoritative set of ""beliefs."" Indeed the Greeks did not have a word for ""belief"" in either of the two familiar senses. Since the existence of the gods was a given it would have made no sense to ask whether someone ""believed"" that the gods existed. On the other hand individuals could certainly show themselves to be more or less mindful of the gods but the common term for that possibility was the gods were to be acknowledged by their rightful place in the scheme of things and were to be given their due. Some bold individuals could but deny that they were due some of the customary observances. But these customary observances were so highly unsystematic that it is not easy to describe the ways in which they were normative for anyone. there was no single truth about the gods. Although the different Greek peoples all recognized the 12 major gods ( in different locations these gods had such different histories with the local peoples as often to make them rather distinct gods or goddesses. Different cities worshipped different deities sometimes with epithets that specified their local nature; Athens had Athena; Sparta Artemis; Corinth was a center for the worship of Aphrodite; Delphi and Delos had Apollo; Olympia had Zeus and so on down to the smaller cities and towns. Identity of names was not even a guarantee of a similar cultus; the Greeks themselves were well aware that the Artemis worshipped at Sparta was a very different deity from the Artemis who was a many-breasted fertility goddess at Ephesus. When literary works such as the related conflicts among the gods because their followers were at war on earth these conflicts were a celestial reflection of the earthly pattern of local deities. Though the worship of the major deities spread from one locality to another and though most larger cities boasted temples to several major gods the identification of different gods with different places remained strong to the end. there was no single true way to live in dealing with the gods. ""The things that have to do with the gods"" had no fixed center and responsibilities for these things had a variety of forms. Each individual city was responsible for its own temples and sacrifices but it fell to the wealthy to sponsor the "" from which the word ""liturgy"" derives)—the festivals and games held in honor of the gods. (members of a large hereditary group) oversaw observances that involved the entire group but fathers were responsible for sacrifices in their own households and women often had autonomous religious rites. individuals had a great deal of autonomy in dealing with the gods. After some particularly striking experience they could bestow a new title upon a god or declare some particular site as sacred (cf. Gen. 16:13–14 where Hagar does both). No authority accrued to the individual who did such a thing and no obligation fell upon anyone else—only a new opportunity or possibility was added to the already vast and ill-defined repertoire for the lines between divinity and were in some ways clearly defined and in other ways ambiguous. Setting aside the complicated genealogies in which gods sired children upon human women and goddesses bore the children of human lovers historical individuals could receive cultic honors for their deeds during life after their death—in other words were considered to have acquired extraordinary power and on the strength of their glory (kudos) would be chosen as generals in time of war. Itinerant healers and leaders of initiatory rites would sometimes be called in to a city to deliver it from disasters without such a measure implying any disbelief in the gods or exaltation of such ""saviors."" To put it differently "" ""salvation"") could come from divine or human hands and the Greeks offered cultic honors to abstractions like Chance divinities that stood in ambiguous relation to the personalized gods of the tradition. All in all "" or ""theology"" in the Greek tradition; no heresy or any other social phenomenon articulated according to a background orientation created a codified order of religious understanding. Such variety in Greek religion reflects the long complicated history of the Greek-speaking peoples. Greek religion spans a period from Minoan and Mycenaean periods to the days of Hellenistic Greece and its ultimate conquest by the . Religious ideas continued to develop over this time; by the time of the earliest major monument of Greek literature a consensus had already developed about who the major Olympian gods were. Still changes to the canon remained possible; the seems to have been unaware of Dionysus a god whose worship apparently spread after it was written and who became important enough to be named one of the 12 chief Olympian deities ousting the ancient goddess of the hearth Hestia. It has been written by scholars that Dionysus was a ""foreign"" deity brought into Greece from outside local cults In addition to the local cults of major gods various places like crossroads and sacred groves had their own tutelary spirits. There were often altars erected outside the precincts of the temples. Shrines like hermai were erected outside the temples as well. Heroes were demigods or deified humans who were part of local legendary history; they too had local hero-cults and often served as oracles for purposes of divination. What religion was was traditional; the idea of novelty or innovation in worship was out of the question almost by definition. Religion was the collection of local practices to honor the local gods. has written on the private cults in ancient Greece as a traceable point for many practices and worship of deities. A major function of religion was the validation of the identity and culture of individual communities. The myths were regarded by many as history rather than allegory and their embedded genealogies were used by groups to proclaim their divine right to the land they occupied and by individual families to validate their exalted position in the social order The Shotgun Method: The Demography of the Ancient Greek City-State Culture MO: University of Missouri Press The Complete World of Greek Mythology.

It involves studies of the physical properties (luminosity composition of celestial objects as well as their interactions. Scientists in the field of astrophysics are known as . They typically apply many areas of physics and atomic and molecular physics. Astrophysics can be subdivided into observational and theoretical aspects. Through observational astrophysics scientists have discovered and studied such objects as and black holes. They have also observed the birth and death of stars and the composition of the . Theoretical astrophysics has led to models for the formation and evolution of stars and the universe as a whole. It has led to theories about the proposals about the existence of and the formulation of string cosmology and astroparticle physics. 's general theory of relativity plays a major role in theoretical astrophysics. is as ancient as recorded history itself it was long separated from the study of physics. In the Aristotelian worldview the celestial world tended towards perfection: Bodies in the sky seemed to be perfect spheres moving in perfectly circular orbits. By contrast the earthly world seemed linked to imperfection. These two realms were not seen as related. ) first put forward the notion that the motions of the celestial bodies could be explained by assuming that the in the geocentric thinking of the time Aristarchus' heliocentric theory was deemed outlandish and heretical the apparently common-sense view that the Sun and other planets circled the Earth went basically unquestioned. giving it a mathematical foundation. In 1609 discovered the four brightest moons of and documented their orbits about that planet. His work gave observational support to the heliocentric model. However he was compelled to recant his heliocentric ideas to escape serious punishment from the which held the geocentric dogma that was prevalent at that time. The availability of accurate observational data (mainly from the observatory of ) led to research into theoretical explanations for the observed behavior. At first only empirical rules were discovered such as Kepler's laws of planetary motion discovered at the start of the seventeenth century. In the later part of that century bridged the gap between Kepler's laws and Galileo's dynamics discovering that the same laws that rule the dynamics of objects on Earth rule the motion of planets and the the application of Newtonian gravity and Newton's laws to explain Kepler's laws of planetary motion became the first unification of astronomy and physics. After Isaac Newton published his book maritime navigation was transformed. Starting around 1670 the entire world was measured using essentially modern . The needs of navigation provided a drive for progressively more accurate astronomical observations and instruments providing a background for ever more available data for scientists. At the end of the nineteenth century a multitude of spectral lines were discovered (regions where there was less or no light). Experiments with hot gases showed that the same lines could be observed in the spectra of gases specific lines corresponding to unique it was shown that chemical elements found in the Sun (chiefly ) were also found on Earth. Indeed was first discovered in the spectrum of the Sun and only later on Earth hence its name. During the twentieth century spectroscopy (the study of these spectral lines) advanced particularly as quantum physics was developed and found necessary to understand the astronomical and experimental observations. an open cluster of stars observed in the Astrophysical observations are generally made in various segments of the Optical astronomy is the oldest kind of astronomy involving the observation of celestial objects in the visible range of light. The instrument most commonly used is the telescope so image quality is improved by the use of adaptive optics and . By studying the spectra of objects in the night sky researchers are able to determine the chemical composition of stars scientists study radiation with a greater than a few millimeters. The instruments used are very large radio telescopes. Radio waves are usually emitted by cold objects including interstellar gas and dust clouds. The is thought to be the redshifted light from the . Pulsars were first detected at astronomy involves the study of radiation of wavelengths longer than the wavelengths of visible light but shorter than those of radio waves. Infrared observations are usually made with telescopes similar to the usual optical telescopes. Objects colder than stars (such as planets) are normally studied at infrared frequencies. and gamma ray astronomy involve the study of very energetic processes and many others. These types of radiation are blocked by the Earth's atmosphere to a large extent. To observe celestial objects and phenomena in these regions of the electromagnetic spectrum scientists rely on space-based telescopes and ground-based imaging air Cherenkov telescopes (IACT). of the first type include RXTE and the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. Examples of IACTs are the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) and the MAGIC telescope. Besides studying electromagnetic radiation from distant objects astrophysicists also look for such things as gravitational waves . A few gravitational wave observatories have been constructed but gravitational waves are extremely difficult to detect. Neutrino observatories have also been built consisting of very high energy particles can be observed striking the Earth's atmosphere. Observations can also vary by timescale. Most optical observations take minutes to hours so phenomena that occur faster than that cannot be readily observed. Also historical data on some objects is available spanning centuries or millennia. On the other hand radio observations may look at events on a millisecond timescale (millisecond pulsars) or combine years of data (pulsar deceleration studies). The information obtained from these different timescales is very different. Study of the Sun occupies a special place in observational astrophysics. Given the tremendous distances of all other stars the Sun can be observed at a level of detail unparalleled by any other star. Human understanding of the Sun serves as a guide to the understanding of other stars. The topic of how stars change is often modeled by placing the varieties of star types in their respective positions on what is called the . This diagram can be viewed as representing the state of a stellar object from birth to destruction. The material composition of astronomical objects can often be examined using: Theoretical astrophysicists endeavor to create theoretical models and figure out the observational consequences of those models. This approach helps observers look for data that can confirm or refute a model or helps them choose between several alternate models. Theorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data. In the case of an inconsistency the general tendency is to make minimal modifications to a model to fit the data. In some cases a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model. Theoretical astrophysicists use a variety of tools including analytical models (such as polytropes to approximate the behavior of a ) and computational numerical simulations. Each offers some advantages. Analytical models of a process are generally better at giving insights into the heart of what is going on. Numerical models can reveal the existence of phenomena and effects that cannot otherwise be seen. Topics studied by theoretical astrophysicists include: Stellar dynamics and evolution; galaxy formation; large-scale structure of ; general relativity and physical cosmology including string cosmology and astroparticle physics. Astrophysical relativity serves as a tool to gauge the properties of large-scale structures in which gravitation plays a significant role in physical phenomena and as a basis for understanding black holes and gravitational waves. Some widely accepted and studied theories and models in astrophysics now included in the Lambda-CDM model are the and fundamental theories of physics. A few examples of this process: How the stars shine and how metals formed Black holes at the center of Andromeda galaxy are the current leading topics in astrophysics as their discovery and controversy originated during the study of galaxies.

Sexuality involves the body this article regards sexuality holistically and does not separate out the physiological mechanics of the reproductive system. There are a great many forms of human sexuality comprising a broad range of behaviors and sexual expression varies across and historical periods. Yet the basic principles of human sexuality are universal and integral to what it means to be human. Sex is related to the very purpose of human existence: love . Sexuality has social ramifications; therefore most societies set limits and legal constraints on what is permissible sexual behavior. Stages on the way to sexual arousal Criminal non-consensual and consensual sexual behavior concur in viewing sexual intimacy as proper only within ; otherwise it can be destructive to human flourishing. The and accounts of the decline of the brought on by decadent sexual mores are examples of how traditional wisdom has viewed the wrong use of sex as a cause of human downfall. Human sexual activity is more than a physical activity it impacts the minds and hearts as well as the bodies of the participants People may experiment with a range of sexual activities during their lives though they tend to engage in only a few of these regularly. However most societies have defined some sexual activities as inappropriate (wrong person and so forth). The most widespread sexual norm historically and the norm promoted nearly universally by the world's is that sex is appropriate only within . Accompanying this norm is the widespread belief that sex acts are devalued when engaged in outside of the marriage bed. However extramarital sexual activity and casual sex have become increasingly accepted in modern society as a result of the is that a sexual activity can express committed or be a meaningless casual event for recreational purposes. Yet sexual encounters are not merely a physical activity like enjoying good food. Sex involves the partners in their totality as well as their bodies. Therefore sexual relations have lasting impact on the psyche. Sexuality is a powerful force that can do tremendous good or terrible harm; therefore it carries with it moral responsibility. depicts the Virgin Mary's Assumption into heaven with her body and soul. often restricted and denigrated sex. Medieval taught that sex was dirty and impure as the ideal of womanhood and encouraging true believers to live who created a strict divide between the spiritual and the carnal traditional Roman Catholic doctrine understood the purpose of sex as procreation nothing more. (The church's continuing ban on birth control on the rationale that it separates sex from its natural procreative function is a remnant of this view.) In only monks could live a holy life and attain the highest enlightenment; this required above all abstaining from sex and denying all desires of the as the natural state. These religions traditionally encouraged believers to have a healthy sex life within marriage. Thus the Among His signs is that He created spouses for you among yourselves that you may console yourselves with them. He has planted affection and mercy between you (S 30.21). led Christians to re-appropriate the goodness of married sex. Today's Protestants have been joined by post- progressive Catholics in promoting the belief that sex is a gift of to express love between husband and wife and increase the health and satisfaction of marriage: Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and cleaves to his wife and they become one flesh ( Let your fountain be blessed and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth… May her breasts satisfy you always ( According to the Jewish mystical teachings of the the time of sexual intercourse is a moment of great holiness ) descends to the couple and showers them with blessings. In line with the holiness of the conjugal union couples customarily reserve the evening of the as the time for sexual intercourse. Sex outside of marriage is a different matter. The major religions condemn extramarital sex as sinful. Even sexual attraction to anyone who is not one’s spouse is condemnable: You shall not commit adultery ( for whosoever does that shall meet the price of sin—doubled shall be the chastisement for him on the Resurrection Day (Qur’an But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart ( Religions embody the centuries-old traditional wisdom that has been the downfall of good men and women throughout history. Sexual misconduct is somehow connected to the and afterwards covered their lower parts (Genesis 3:7). To overcome this problem and especially the mastery of sexual desire as the foundation for personal maturity and a right relationship with God. The sexual revolution that burst on the scene in the 1960s has promoted an alternative sexual ethic asserting that recreational sex is a healthy activity. It condemned mores that limited sex to the marriage bed as restrictive of personal freedom and asserted that sex between consenting partners is a positive value for promoting intimacy and affection. magazine became the chief popularizer of this new ethic and its ""Playboy philosophy"" has shaped the sexual attitudes of several generations. trumpeted the life of bachelor pleasures where women are sex objects to be enjoyed as opposed to responsible and unselfish partnerships with women thus rationalizing the worldview of adolescent boys. Several currents came together in the 1960s to turn America's sexual mores upside-down. First was the of birth control. The birth control pill was perfected for the first time giving women the freedom to engage in sexual relations without fear of . Women traditionally acted to restrain men's sexual proclivities since they had borne the consequences of sex in pregnancy and motherhood. Now that constraint was lifted. also changed female attitudes towards sex. Feminists beginning with decried women's subservience to men. They exposed the Victorian double standard that permitted men to indulge their appetites with multiple lovers but expected women to be . They attacked the long-standing misogynist tradition that regarded women as property—hence any bride who was not a virgin was stigmatized as ""damaged goods""—and which denied that women should even expect to achieve sexual satisfaction. To counter this injustice feminists declared that women should be able to have sex on equal terms with men to claim their right to sexual pleasure and even beat men in their own game of sexual domination. From this point of view a woman's efforts in the sexual sphere could be an expression of a liberated consciousness. also contributed to a questioning of traditional sexual mores. Many of Freud's patients were afflicted by and psychosomatic ailments with no medical cause. He determined the cause to be sexual repression from early childhood which was buried deep in the . As the child becomes aware of his genitals he develops a sexual attraction to his mother which he represses as he grows into adulthood. Freud then developed the theory of the sexual desires against the constraints of it is not just a few neurotic people who suffer from the Oedipus complex but it is a universal feature of the human condition. Psychoanalysis sought to free patients from the guilt stemming from these repressed desires. Although Freud regarded the strictures of religion and culture as a positive civilizing influence not a few popularizers took the view that people should be able to enjoy sex free from guilt. brought the sexual revolution to the public scene as her thought concerning sexual freedom pervaded academia. Published in 1928 focused on the psychosexual development of adolescent children on the island of . She recorded that the sexual freedom experienced by the adolescents actually permitted them an easy transition from childhood to adulthood. Mead called for a change in suppression of sexuality in America and her work directly resulted in the advancement of the sexual revolution. promoted the idea that sexual infidelity and were far more common than people had suspected. Kinsey also reportedly asserted that human beings need frequent sexual outlets—whether heterosexual or masturbatory the context was irrelevant—or they will suffer from psychological problems. As a result people began to question their moral reservations about sex outside of marriage believing they were missing out on pleasures others were enjoying and even that they might be damaging their psychological well-being.

Nevertheless it has had profound impact on The sexual revolution burst on to the where it became part and parcel of youth rebellion against authority and critique of conventional religion that denied the body. the guiding light of the New Left that by liberating people to enjoy their sexuality freely it could help tear down the structures of capitalist oppression and build a new society of transformed people who would no longer wish to make their partner an object of domination (in marriage). of the original sexual revolution. Although the idealism and passions have long since cooled the change it brought to America's sexual mores has remained a permanent legacy—for better or for worse. In the context of a happy expressing and reinforcing the profound commitment between spouses who are sharing their lives together. Sex is a deep encounter of heart and body. It is both instinctual and transcendent mundane yet miraculous. Sex symbolizes the couple's desire for oneness as neither the heart nor the genitals can find fulfillment without the beloved. Therefore sex finds its deepest satisfaction within the discipline of marriage. Sex within marriage fulfills several important roles: Sex strengthens the bond between husband and wife in all aspects of their lives; and affection and fosters emotional intimacy; Sex reinforces the exclusivity of the relationship; Sex symbolizes mutual submission and dedication to the higher purpose of the marriage; Sex reduces anxiety and releases tension; Sex leads to children who are wanted and treasured by both and thus reinforces the security and binding power of the couple's sexuality. Studies have found that approximately 85 to 90 percent of married women and around 75 to 80 percent of married men in the The sexual act is fraught with responsibility to the children it may create. Restricting sexuality to marriage creates the most secure foundation for the care of children. Since spend a lifetime rearing their children the nature of the parental bond impacts the next generation to a greater extent than it does in the majority of . The monogamous bond of husband and wife provides a unique relationship that supports the resulting . Two parents united in the common goal of their children can ensure that their lineage is secure and prosperous. When parents are not monogamous the family structure is less clear and the children experience a variety of adults with varying degrees of commitment to their future. Research is unequivocal that children raised by do not fare as well as those raised by parents who maintain sexual fidelity. Good lovemaking depends mainly upon the spouses' attitude and on the quality of their relationship. People cannot easily control the physical aspect of sex but they can and should work on improving the relational context within which lovemaking takes place. A good context for lovemaking requires trust Frequency of Lovemaking in Married Couples The nature of a couple's sex life changes over time; it goes through ""seasons"" like the seasons of the year—spring During the first few years of marriage sex is full of excitement. The couple is infatuated with one another and feels so closely bonded that they are not aware of the differences between them. When two people fall in love and engage in a sexual relationship they begin to include their partners in their concepts of themselves. People feel like they acquire new capabilities because they have the support of close partners. ""I might not be able to handle parenthood by myself but with the help of my partner's good parenting skills I'll be a good parent."" This overlap of the concepts of self and partner has been called ""self-expansion."" People generally experience a high level of self-expansion at the beginning of relationships when they constantly learn new things about themselves and their partners. However the rate of self-expansion slows and people experience a relative decline in satisfaction. After two to three years of marriage all kinds of differences begin to surface including different sexual preferences. The spouses are less willing to overlook these differences and must negotiate a shared sex style. Sexual satisfaction is also eroded by the arguments and conflict that inevitably crop up in marriage. Couples who deal poorly with arguments and conflicts build up a history of negative emotional interactions that can negatively affect their sex life. (This is when unmarried cohabiting couples often split up.) On the other hand those who succeed in dealing with conflict through mutual support and good develop deep trust and closeness in their relationship. Such relationships result in greater satisfaction and long-lasting happiness that is qualitatively different from the excitement of the early stages of a relationship. After the first child is born: The birth of a child brings a marked reduction in the mother's sexual desire. She is typically exhausted from caring for the child and feels her husband's demand for sex to be selfish. The father in turn feels neglected and left out of the intense bonding that is occurring between mother and child. During this phase which may last as long as there are young children to care for the couple may need to schedule time for sex. As the man gets older and can no longer come to arousal autonomously he may need his wife's help. Meanwhile the wife may enjoy sex more since the children are gone and menopause has increased her . These years are marked by increased companionship and cooperation extends to the sexual act. good sex is seen as only one element of a good is most often the number one complaint in an unhappy marriage. For this reason it is incumbent upon couples to work on their sex lives to make sex an asset to marital harmony and not a source of marital discord. Common challenges to sexual satisfaction in marriage include: These can damage the couple's sense of connection. They may use the bedroom as a battlefield either to act out their aggression or to withhold favors. The man may think that he is supposed to always be ready and able to perform well while the woman may have higher expectations for pleasure than her man can deliver. When they fall short thinking that ""everyone else"" is having better sex when in fact these unrealistic expectations come largely from This comes from couples who stick to a fixed routine with a narrow repertoire of sex and touching and are not playful about trying new things to stimulate their partner. This can cause all sorts of distortions in the viewer's expectations of his or her partner that can damage their sex life. The viewer of may be eager to try all sorts of kinky practices that his partner may not want. Porn stars are always aroused leading the viewer to have a self-centered view of sex that does not include the effort required to please his partner—who has her own needs. Masturbating in front of pornography can drain the so the viewer is no longer interested in sex with his spouse. Men can be anxious about achieving or maintaining arousal or fear that they may come to climax prematurely. Women may be worried that they are not achieving orgasm. This is exacerbated when there is poor communication between the partners; for instance when the man thinks he is supposed to know what to do and cannot receive suggestions well because he takes it as a sign of inadequacy. In good sex both partners are receptive to learning from the other and asking each other's help. These can include shame about the body or guilt about having pleasure as when one partner dislikes messiness or thinks that she is not supposed to enjoy sex too much. This can sometimes be caused by deep-seated One spouse may set unrealistic demands using sex as a stick to force changes in the other's behavior. It would be better for both spouses to be tolerant of each other and willing to have sex even when there are unresolved issues. It is quite common for the partners to have different natural levels of sex drive yet it is the number one complaint among couples seeking marital counseling. Desire naturally ebbs and flows but at different times for the husband and wife. Reduced desire can be caused by the pressures of as when a senior man loses interest just as his wife who is over her menopause is warming up. Thirty percent of women and 15 percent of men have low libido. the partners need to avoid accusing the other of being a ""cold fish"" or a ""sex maniac "" and instead find ways to empathize with each other and support each other. The spouse with lower desire can make efforts to accommodate the other's greater level of passion while looking for ways to raise his or her own libido. He or she may find that starting the motions of sex even though he or she has no desire for it can spark a flame. Many happily married wives say they are not in the mood when they start but they enjoy it later. The spouse with higher desire should not take his or her spouse's disinterest personally. He or she can learn to be an expert at stimulating his or her spouse to become aroused and when that does not work to redirect his or her sexual energy to non-genital sensual pastimes. He or she should learn to be direct in asking for sex and at the same time he or she should be able to turn off the pressure if his or her partner refuses. good sex is possible when each partner has self-mastery and understands their own arousal; when each takes responsibility to keep a positive and loving attitude towards the other; when each helps the other through good communication and being at expert in what the spouse likes; and when the couple develops many diverse ways to express affection. Stages on the way to sexual arousal Males and females exhibit different patterns of sexual arousal. In a dating situation typically the man feels a physical attraction towards the woman and wants to touch and kiss. The woman tends to want to connect emotionally rather than physically; she may feel a sentimental longing for her partner and other intense feelings. At a certain point of greater intimacy the positions will be exchanged. The woman will now feel the desire for physical touch on top of her emotional feelings while the male will experience the more emotional longing along with the physical. Both will progress to a more overtly sexual desire if they allow their relationship to progress. Walking and talking together leads to holding hands. A simple kiss progresses to prolonged kissing and petting. Long spells of embracing and kissing will likely bring on strong arousal in the male. Once arousal reaches this point it is extremely difficult to stop. Touching the private areas of the body will cause strong arousal in the female. Involvement of the sexual organs directly will prompt intense impulses to actually engage in sexual intercourse. Sexual desire presents a profound challenge of the to overcome the body. Males are chiefly tempted by sexual desire to disregard a young woman’s heart and to focus on her body as an object of pleasure. Females may be tempted to use sex as a way to hold on to a male as an object of security. It is said that men tend to regard as the way to get sex and women tend to use sex as the way to get love. increasing the time spent together between two members of the opposite sex will almost always invite the emergence of sexual attraction and sexual feelings. Couples may pass through the stages of sexual arousal quickly or over a long period of time according to the partners’ decisions. This is why prudent couples do not give themselves the opportunity to be alone together before they are ready for sex. They recognize the signs of stimulation and take a step backwards. The consummation of sexual intercourse irrevocably changes the nature of the relationship. If the couple is sexual intercourse is a confirmation and celebration of their mutual Complete conjugal love includes four elements: compatibility and goals—is the objective foundation for a relationship. to persevere through hard times. is the feeling of closeness and connectedness. at its best supports and celebrates the other three elements leading to a high degree of satisfaction. When one or more of these elements are lacking sexual passion may accentuate the sense of incompleteness in the relationship. includes intimacy and passion but no commitment. This is a common experience during youth. The pair is caught up in the experience of physical arousal and feelings of closeness but lack the readiness or maturity to commit to sharing their lives together. Infatuation has passion only an entrancing sexual attraction with neither intimacy nor commitment. This is “love at first sight” and is characterized by preoccupation with the other person extreme ups and downs of feelings and an intense longing to be with the object of desire. In both cases compatibility may be thin or nonexistent. Commitment is generally signified by marriage or plans to marry. Where there is no commitment especially if it occurs early on. Sexual involvement can create a false sense of intimacy that can easily replace real and other activities that foster authentic intimacy. It focuses both partners on the physical which lends itself to mutual or one-sided exploitation. The often subtle escalation of selfishness that physical intimacy brings increases jealousy and possessiveness. Often one partner can sense something is wrong and want to stop the sexual intimacy or even the relationship but this is difficult. Sexual relations imply an obligation and the relationship may begin to feel like a trap. Guilt can generate an undercurrent of tension that gnaws at the relationship. Mastery of one’s sexual desire is a potent sign of respect for oneself and the other and an indication of the self-discipline and maturity needed for a successful Sexual attraction is fueled by a person's emitted by the partner. Once the progression of arousal reaches a certain point it is next to impossible to stop. This is why it is wise for couples who seek to cultivate an authentic relationship to set boundaries limiting physical intimacy to prevent sexual arousal. If these are clear from the outset both companions can feel freer to enjoy each other’s company. Boundaries keep the relationship honest and help avoid embarrassing situations where one must stop the other’s advances Severing of the link between sex and comes at the expense of traditional norms of marriage and some ethicists regard sex is a morally appropriate activity as long as there is some degree of and affection. They would classify as immoral only sex that is ""loveless"" or ""meaningless."" people have sex for many reasons Expressing passionate feelings of liking someone feelings that are of the moment with no commitment intended; and intimacy and commitment to a relationship but keeping open the possibility of ending it in the future; in an arrangement where one or both parents is not obligated to be its parent. which is rampant in today's youth culture of ""hook-ups "" whereby people get together for sex with no expectation of a romantic relationship. More common is the practice of ""serial monogamy"": a series of exclusive relationships characterized by intimacy and romance that last for some time. Nevertheless the term ""serial monogamy"" is more often more descriptive than prescriptive in that those involved did not plan to have subsequent relationships while involved in each Mutual consent and emotional connection legitimate sexual liaisons where the commitment of is absent. Sex in such relationships can seem to function in the same way as sex in marriage: expressing affection adding sparkle to their relationship and helping it to feel special. Unfortunately it can also bring about practically the exact opposite of what sex does in marriage. It can highlight an underlying sense of emotional insecurity and anxiety. These effects may be subtle at first but they take their toll. The aftermath to a broken romance or a series of casual ""hook-ups"" can lead to years of regret: used feeling of having given a precious part of myself…to so many and for nothing still aches. I never imagined I'd pay so dearly and for so long. Such experiences are all too common. People who choose to practice casual sex are likely to face have more difficulties in subsequent relationships with others and cause spiritual damage to their eternal The chances of contracting a sexually transmitted disease (STD) increase with the number of partners one has. Thus is a potential (often intended) consequence of sexual activity. It is a common outcome even when birth control is used. For a young woman not involved in a committed relationship and rearing of a child can interrupt her education and derail her dreams for a promising career leaving her with the prospect of years of struggle as a single mother. She may choose to have an but that carries health risks and can leave psychological scars. Casual sex can be a corrupting influence. It is no secret that people will lie and cheat to get sex. In one group of 75 middle-class 19-year-old male students 65 percent admitted getting a young woman drunk to have sex more than 40 percent had used verbal intimidation and 20 percent had used force or threats of violence. In a study of University of California students a quarter of men who were sexually involved with more than one person at a time said that their partners did not know. When people treat others as sex objects to be exploited they end up debasing themselves. and shame are the common aftermath of uncommitted sex. Several surveys suggest that half of sexually experienced students report ""tremendous guilt"" as part of the aftermath. for a woman: giving herself to an unworthy relationship . A man might feel guilt over having discarded a partner and witnessing her heartbreak: ""I finally got the girl into bed…but then she started saying she loved me…. When I finally dumped her Loss of self-respect is a common outcome of non-marital sex with multiple partners. Whether sex is a matter of making conquests or negotiating favors using another or being used it comes at the cost of feeling valued as a person who is uniquely loved. When sexual utility is the criterion for attention there is always the underlying anxiety that someone else will perform better or look more attractive. Sexual addiction is a pattern of behavior when people use sex as an easy escape from the challenges and responsibilities of life. Sex is a powerful distraction away from the important tasks that adolescents need to complete on the way to personal maturity and gaining career skills and can thus hinder personal growth. Sex can damage relationships in several ways. When a friendship becomes sexual it changes sometimes derailing a warm and caring relationship that could have been a good basis for marriage. On the other hand a sexual relationship can trap people who otherwise would not care for each other. Sexual expectations can consume all the energy in a relationship and the development of other shared interests that could sustain the relationship and help it grow. Breaking up from a romantic relationship where sex is involved can result in depression and precipitate an emotional crisis. In extreme cases it can lead to self-destructive behavior or to violent rage against the former partner and his or her new lover. A sexual betrayal can create lasting issues of trust that can make it very difficult to enter into or sustain subsequent relationships. The memory of former sexual partners can haunt a marriage and make it more difficult for the married couple to cultivate an exclusive bond. The habit of indulging sexual feelings before marriage makes it more difficult to resist the temptation to indulge in an affair that could wreck the marriage. Human sexual behavior is typically influenced . There are both explicit and implicit rules governing sexual expression. Examples of the former are prohibitions of extramarital sexual intercourse or marked the norm defining what culturally permissible sex is. As this norm was disregarded it was replaced by the age of consent. Thus three out of four Americans frown on teenagers having sex before marriage yet more than half believe it generally beneficial for adults to do it. Parents and teachers now give the message that sex is not for children. However young people can see the hypocrisy as adults practice a sexual norm that permits unmarried sex as long as the partners were consenting; furthermore including even advocates of character education have had great difficulty advocating a stand on sex for children that they were reluctant to practice themselves. Example is the strongest teacher and children tend to copy their parents' behavior. Living with a single parent is the strongest predictor of teenage promiscuity. Furthermore for the many children who are the victims of their first sexual experience is with adults. One study indicates that a majority of pregnant adolescent girls (66 percent) began their sexual activity as the result of being or abused by men 27 years old on average. all the lines become blurred. Indeed today's pervasive culture of sex outside of marriage construes shaping the environments in which people live. Sexuality in the media is often expressed in advertising messages where it is distilled into and used to sell products. Critics claim that the media too often glamorizes adolescent sexuality and promiscuous lifestyles and creates unrealistic expectations about romantic love; and that these stereotypes impact people's love life in negative ways. Implicit rules governing sexual expression have to do with cultural expectations such as dress and behaviors. Most traditional cultures frown on public expressions of sexuality especially in comparison with the liberal West. For example actor Richard Gere was arrested in laws after he embraced and kissed an actress in public. Gere apologized and claimed it was ""a naive misread of Indian customs."" Western woman's dress reveals too much for conservative which has led to a resurgence of the veil and other traditional dress. Cultural conflicts over permissible sexual expression are an important subtext in the current ""clash of civilizations."" There is no absolute borderline between the sexual and nonsexual enjoyment of touching or embracing. Short of genital intercourse there is a wide range of other behaviors that may or may not be socially or ethically considered as sexual relations. For example in Asia it is common to see men holding hands as an expression of non-sexual friendship but in America male hand-holding would be interpreted as signifying a homosexual relationship. Sometimes a society's norms and cultural expectations do not reflect the sexual inclinations of certain individuals. Those who wish to express a dissident sexuality have to form sub-cultures within the main culture where they feel free to express their sexuality with like-minded partners (or in the case of monastics Some people engage in various sexual activities as a business transaction. When this involves having sex with or performing certain sexual acts for . Other aspects of the ""adult industry"" include and the like. Most societies view these activities as disreputable and attempt to control or prohibit them at least as regards children. Some of these activities have been shown to have negative effects on marriage and they can fall under similar moral strictures as other extramarital sex. Autoeroticism is sexual activity that does not involve another person as partner; it may involve masturbation or use of certain paraphernalia. Wet dreams and waking sexual fantasies are also autoerotic. Masturbation in adolescence is normally harmless but should it become compulsive it can stunt the development of mature sexuality. In adulthood these behaviors can promote escapism and avoidance of the challenge inherent in building loving relationships; they can also detract from healthy sexual expression. is defined as romantic and erotic orientation towards one's own sex. It encompasses thoughts and overt sexual behavior. The causes of homosexuality are subject of considerable controversy and may be the complex result of many factors. Statistical data of the U.S. population 000 Americans in 1992 by the National Health and Social Life Survey (NHSLS) indicates that 1.4 percent of females and 2.8 percent of males are active homosexuals. erroneously reported the percentage of homosexual men at 10 percent due to sampling errors.) Same-sex attraction can be a powerful force that neither religious teachings nor will-power can defeat. Some who have chosen to pursue a heterosexual lifestyle despite experiencing homosexual desire have succeeded with the support of specialized therapies. circumstances can impair human sexual function. These manifestations can be in the form of diminution or performance limitations. Both males and females can suffer from libido reduction which can have roots in or derive from medical conditions. Performance limitations may most often affect the male in the form of erectile dysfunction (ED). causes of ED may derive from the pathology of which can reduce penile blood flow along with supply of blood to various parts of the body. Environmental stressors such as prolonged exposure to elevated sound levels or over-illumination can also induce cardiovascular changes especially if exposure is chronic. Sexual behavior can be a dangerous vector. Sexual behaviors that involve exchange of bodily fluids with another person entail some risk of transmission of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). These include and human papilloma virus (HPV) "" offers some protection from many STDs. However a condom is ineffective against many common infections which can be transmitted through contact with the skin around the genitals outside the condom's latex barrier. condoms have a 13 to 27 percent failure rate and many people in the heat of passion neglect to use them. Even among ""consistent"" adult condom users the rate of failure to prevent transmission of deadly HIV ranges from 10 to 30 percent according to five different studies. Asking one's partner whether they have an STD is also not reliable protection as people with AIDS and other serious STDs may lie to their partners—25 percent did so according to one California study. The odds of contracting a sexually transmitted disease increase with the number of sexual partners. Each sexual partner may also have a history of sex with a number of other partners from whom he or she might have contracted an infection thus multiplying the risk. Therefore reducing the number of sexual partners is the best protection against sexually transmitted diseases. Some sexual fetishes are dangerous. Partners who practice partial asphyxiation or sadomasochistic bondage to heighten sexual pleasure run the risk of injury and even death. Auto-asphyxiation as part of autoerotic sex is even more dangerous because there is no partner to rescue the person if he or she goes too far. Nearly all civilized societies consider it a serious crime to force someone to engage in sexual behavior or to engage in sexual behavior with someone who does not consent. This is called sexual assault and if sexual penetration occurs it is called the most serious kind of sexual assault. which can be classified as when the abuser is a close relative is the most serious form of rape. It has traumatic effects on the child that can cause a lifetime of psychological and emotional pain. Yet particularly when the abuser is a parent or close relative Precisely what constitutes effective consent is established as a matter of law which recognizes that children should be protected from the sexual activity appropriate to adults. Hence the law may set a minimum age at which a person can consent to have sex—the —and criminalize sex with an underage child even when he or she is a willing participant as statutory rape. The aim of age of consent law is to protect children from the emotional damage that results from sexual activity during their immaturity. occurs in a workplace or school environment where a person in a position of authority makes sexual advances on a subordinate. The coercive element is the implicit threat that the subordinate might be penalized for not complying with these advances. Sexual harassment can also occur when co-workers mock and deride a new employee with sexual language. Another form of abuse is the use of sexual language to demean women. While this has been a traditional pastime among men in private settings talk-show hosts have used coarse and demeaning language on the public airwaves denigrating women as sex objects and denying them their inherent dignity. Criminal non-consensual and consensual sexual behavior Other forms of abusive sexuality that are prohibited in many places include indecent and harassing phone calls and non-consensual exhibitionism (indecent exposure) and voyeurism. Certain consensual sexual actions or activities that are permitted (or not criminalized) in some societies may be viewed as crimes (often of a serious nature) in other societies. The clearest example of this is . Laws prohibiting same-gender sexuality are called from providing legal protection to homosexuals to the point of in others. Other sexual behaviors that are illicit in various jurisdictions include and the manufacture and sale of and pimping are illicit in most countries. While soliciting and obtaining the services of a prostitute may be consensual the situation of the women caught up in prostitution is often exploitative and coercive to the point of involving millions of human beings is the major form of slavery today.

If you have bookmarks or links to our site on your blog or website Write as if you are telling a story Many high school teachers use WHE for their courses. Always write with a high school student in mind as we want them to be able to understand and grasp our content. This should not lead to simplification though: we still want university students and academics to find our content useful at least for a general overview of the subject. “Story” is the key part in the word “history” and our content should reflect that. exciting and a pleasure to read. You can be funny too! Avoid jargon and try not to sound overly academic; we are not lecturing. Focus on being clear and easily understood. and treat every culture or belief system equally. Grab the reader’s attention from the beginning: your first paragraph should give the reader the most important information while encouraging him/her to read further. Tell the reader why he or she should care about your topic. Be straightforward. include a wrap-up at the end that discusses: legacy; influences on later events or ties to the modern world (what the site is like today or a popular movie in which the person is portrayed Definitions are an introduction to a topic. In your first paragraph be sure to specify what your topic is and include dates when applicable (birth and death of a person beginning and end of a war etc.). The title should be short and to the point and using the most common English spelling: “Constantine the Great” or “Hoplite” or “Ziggurat”. Articles usually provide a more detailed discussion of a topic and are often more academic. For example while the definition “Ziggurat” provides the basics about ziggurats an article could be “The Role of the Ziggurat in Mesopotamian Cities” or “An Analysis of Mesopotamian Ziggurats and Egyptian Pyramids”. When you submit a definition or an article we recommend that you also submit images to be used with them. If you want to use images in the text submit the images first. Refer to the “Images” section below for guidelines. All text submissions should be between 1500 and 3000 words in length. All content must be in English; non-English quotations must be translated. Check your spelling and grammar! We recommend which is free to use and it works directly on the AHE website. Use either British or American English (whichever you’re most comfortable with) “don’t” should be written “do not”. When referring to places or people always use their most commonly known English name: state the original names of places such as: Hammurabi (Akkadian from Amorite 'Ammurapi ""the kinsman is a healer"" use the Latin or Greek name. We expect all textual contributions to have a bibliography with a list of sources used. At least half of your sources should be from books or journals as sadly online sources still don't give our readers the same level of trust as print material does (even though there are some great online sources). Please use the bibliography/references section to create your bibliography and don't list it inside your article. Use the book search in the bibliography tool as this will create links to where readers can find the books. Numbers up to twelve should generally be written as words; numbers from 13 upwards should be written with digits. Use BCE / CE for dates instead of BC / AD. for example ""8th century BCE"" Every single date in a text must have a BCE or CE following it Approximate dates are given with circa or c. in front of them. If a date range is approximate add the c. in front of each date separated by a space: c. 1000 BCE to c. 800 BCE. ) as thousand-separator and (.) as decimal separator All measurements must be in metric units and have their approximate imperial equivalent written next to them in brackets. Use abbreviations for converted measurements in brackets. Do not use 'and' within measurements or decimals for imperial measures. Example: ""9 metres (29 ft 6 in)"". Units of measurement are written after each number separated by a space and without a full-stop. Correct is “16 km” not “16km.”. do not use pronouns – always use the names of the people or locations. In a timeline search the reader might see the entry out of context and “He conquers Persia” has no meaning within a random timeline. Instead write “Alexander the Great conquers Persia”. Use complete sentences and write in the present tense. Timeline events should never be longer than two short sentences. Images should always have a description that includes the name of what is depicted and if it’s not in its original location include where it is now (e.g. which Museum) if possible. Only add images that are your own or that have a copyright that allows you to use them (i.e. public domain or creative commons). Reviews should cover books which are currently available to buy on either Amazon or Book Depository. The recommended word length for a review is under 600 words and it should address most if not all of the following points (the preview snippet should include points 1 Who is this book aimed at (scholars young readers etc.) and does it succeed or not in that aim? What is the purpose of the book? (provide an overview examine one specific aspect of a culture Who is the author and what is their background? sections etc.) and review of its approach (archaeology Why the reviewer recommends or not this book? (style How does this book compare with others on the same subject? A description of particular edition features (images but no more than three Replace any spaces in a tag with an underscore always ask yourself: “What subjects does this help illustrate?” add tags of the major locations shown and the time period. add tags for the personalities add tags for which you believe this image is a useful illustration. Don’t overdo it though: A map of Greece would certainly get the tag “Greece” but a Greek vase should not be tagged with “Greece” as that tag is too unspecific. Instead it might be tagged with “Greek_Art”. make a guess. Our editors review all tags so we may change what you have added. In headlines and subheadings all names and nouns should have their first letter capitalized. Quotations are always enclosed by normal double quotes (""); replace any special quotes that might have been inserted by Word such as (“) or (”). The person that is being quoted (and the source of the quotation) must be indicated either in the sentence before or in brackets after the quote. Examples: In Genesis 1:3 God says: “Let there be light.” Punctuation marks of a quoted sentence are within the quotation marks Quotations of more than three lines of length should be quoted using the quote function of the online text editor The name of the person quoted should be included within the quotation block when they are used to as part of the name:  Emperor Augustus Queen Zenobia. Don’t capitalize these words when used on their own: Augustus was the Roman emperor; The queen issued an edict. Capitalize words like “empire” when they are used as part of the name: the Roman Empire. But do not capitalize them when used on their own: The empire grew as more territory was conquered. A common source of confusion: “Queen Zenobia ruled the Palmyrene Empire” but “The Mesopotamian king Gilgamesh was also said to have been buried beneath a river.” They are used to separate two independent clauses that are connected by ideas. So you could write: I walked to the Roman Forum today and it was much bigger than I expected it to be. I walked to the Roman Forum today; it was much bigger than I expected it to be. I walked to the Roman Forum today. It was much bigger than I expected it to be. But not: I walked to the Roman Forum today; and it was much bigger than I expected it to be. Do not use contractions with semicolon. Semicolons can be used to separate items in a complicated list. For example The House of the Faun at Pompeii was chock full of fascinating mosaics: the Alexander Mosaic now in the Naples Archaeological Museum; a depiction of masks also now in Naples; and some still in situ meaning “Hale” on the floor as you enter. Use Chicago style for references and citations. You only need to add in-text citations for direct quotations. Always add your bibliography using the references section of an article or image; do not include the bibliography in your text. Book titles should always be italicised both in the bibliography and in the text. Avoid underlines in your texts as they suggest a web link. You should aim to include at least one image in your articles. For definitions and you may also add additional images using the search We have also been recommended for educational use by the following publications: is a non-profit organization registered in Canada. is a non-profit company registered in the United Kingdom.

Therefore this page provides a listing of each of the computer firsts starting with the Difference Engine and leading up to the computers we use today. Early inventions that lead up to the computer are not accounted for on this page. When was the word ""computer"" first used? First mechanical computer or automatic computing engine concept.

The definition of a computer remained the same until the end of the 19th century when the industrial revolution gave rise to mechanical machines whose primary purpose was calculating. First mechanical computer or automatic computing engine concept which is considered the first automatic computing machine that could approximate polynomials. The Difference Engine was capable of computing several sets of numbers and making of the results. Babbage received some help with the development of the Difference Engine from considered to be the first computer Babbage was never able to complete a full-scale functional version of this machine. In June the London Science Museum completed the Difference Engine No 2 for the bicentennial year of Babbage's birth and later completed the printing mechanism in 2000. proposed the first general mechanical computer . The Analytical Engine contained an ALU ( . It is the first general-purpose computer concept that could be used for many things and not only one particular computation. Unfortunately this computer was also never built while Charles Babbage was alive. In was able to complete a portion of this machine and perform basic calculations. The first machine to record and store information developed a method for machines to record and store information on for the US census. Hollerith's machine was approximately ten times faster than manual tabulations and saved the census office millions of dollars. Hollerith would later form the company we know today as in his parents' living room between and 1938. It is considered to be the first electromechanical programmable computer and the first functional modern computer. First concepts of what we consider a modern computer and became the foundation for theories about computing and computers. The machine was a device that printed symbols on paper tape in a manner that emulated a person following a series of logical instructions. Without these fundamentals we wouldn't have the computers we use today. was the first electric programmable computer and was first demonstrated in December was created to help the British code breakers read encrypted German messages. . Its development continued until 1942 at the Iowa State College (now Iowa State University). The ABC was an electrical computer that used more than 300 (was not programmable). On October 19 US Federal Judge Earl R. Larson signed his decision that the ENIAC patent by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly was invalid. In the decision Larson named Atanasoff the sole inventor. at the University of Pennsylvania and began construction in 800 square feet and used about 18 weighing almost 50 tons. Although a judge later ruled the ABC computer was the first digital computer many still consider the ENIAC to be the first digital computer because it was fully functional. The first computer to electronically store and execute a program was the also known as the ""Baby"" or ""Manchester Baby and built by his protégée with the assistance of Geoff Tootill at the University of Manchester England. Kilburn wrote the first electronically-stored program which finds the highest proper factor of an using repeated subtraction rather than division. Kilburn's program was executed on June 21 The second stored-program computer was also British: the at the University of Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory in England. The EDSAC performed its first calculation on May 6 . It was also the first computer to run a graphical computer game "" an implementation of tic-tac-toe displayed on a 6-inch was another computer that could run stored programs. Built at the Victoria University of Manchester the first version of the Mark 1 computer became operational in April . Mark 1 was used to run a program to search for Mersenne for nine hours without error on June 16 and 17 that same year. by J.

Buckley spent much of the next year and a half touring to promote It seemed to be a tiring yet effective means for him to keep his independence from his record company with which he had a strained relationship. From the album's release he played in numerous countries to the UK (Glastonbury Festival and the Meltdown Festival at the invitation of Elvis Costello. In 1995 Buckley played a concert at the Paris Olympia a venue made famous by the French vocalist Édith Piaf that he considered the finest performance of his career. Sony has since released a live recording of that performance. his venues shrank as he returned to playing bars and cafés as he once had before fame hit. Buckley went on his ""phantom solo tour"" of cafés in the appearing under a series of aliases: The Crackrobats and A Puppet Show Named Julio. By way of justification Buckley posted a note on the Internet stating that he missed the anonymity of playing in cafes and local bars: There was a time in my life not too long ago when I could show up in a cafe and simply do what I do learn from performing my music explore what it means to me have fun while I irritate and/or entertain an audience who don't know me or what I am about. In this situation I have that precious and irreplaceable luxury of failure of surrender. I worked very hard to get this kind of thing together this work forum. I loved it and then I missed it when it disappeared. All I am doing is reclaiming it. Much of the material from the tours of 1995 and 1996 was recorded and has been released posthumously on albums such as Buckley often covered his songs during his café tours. Buckley started to write for a new album to be called In 1997 he moved to Memphis where he rented a shotgun house of which he was so fond he contacted the owner about the possibility of buying it. Buckley started recording demos on his own 4-track recorder. He went into the studio again and plans for the new album looked hopeful. Buckley went for an evening swim in Wolf River Harbor and singing along to a radio playing Led Zeppelin's ""Whole Lotta Love."" A roadie of Buckley's band watched from the shore and cautioned him not to swim too far out. Foti looked away for a few moments to move the radio and a guitar out of reach of the wake from a passing tugboat. When he looked up Buckley was no where in sight. Despite a determined rescue effort that night and the search was called off the following day due to heavy rain. Three days later his body was spotted by a tourist on a riverboat marina and was brought ashore. written about him and his father reveals that the night before his death Buckley reportedly admitted to several loved ones that he suffered from bipolar disorder. The autopsy confirmed that Buckley had taken no illegal drugs before his swim and a drug overdose was ruled out as the cause of death. He was 30 years old. A recent statement from the Buckley estate insists: Jeff Buckley's death was not ""mysterious . We have a police report and an eye witness to prove that it was an accidental drowning and that Mr. Buckley was in a good frame of mind prior to the accident. a collection of demo recordings and a full length album he had been reworking for his second album were released as Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk - the compilation being overseen by Chris Cornell.

According to a Buckley wanted to ""find his own voice "" to transcend the legacy his father had left and to produce unique original work which he alone could contribute. Jeff Buckley captivated and continues to enchant audiences not only with his talent and broad vocal range but with the degree of emotion and vulnerability exposed while performing.

It is located about two-thirds of the way from 430 km east). Wake Island is actually an atoll comprising three islands and is built upon a occupied under a caretaker permit from the U.S. Air Force administered by the Office of Insular Affairs U.S. Department of the Interior. Access to the island is restricted and all current activities on the island are managed by the United States Air Force and Army. The and U.S. governments have competing claims over the island both of which are challenged by a separatist group of Marshall Island descendants who call themselves the Kingdom of EnenKio "" a concept commonly held in There has never been a settlement of an indigenous population on Wake Island though lore has it that Marshall Islanders traveled to the atoll in search of seabirds and the human history of the atoll has for the most part been exclusive to military use. The island was of strategic importance in was the scene of a crucial meeting between U.S. President in the early months of the camp for tens of thousands of refugees who fled their homeland after the fall of Saigon ended the USGS Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite image of Wake Island. Wake Island is located to the west of the International Date Line and is one day ahead of the Although Wake is officially called an it is actually an atoll comprising three islands (Wake and Peale) surrounding a central lagoon . Referring to the atoll as an island is the result of a pre- desire by the United States Navy to distinguish Wake from other atolls Coastline: Wake Atoll- 21.0 mi (33.8 km) Wake Proper-12.0 mi (19.3 km) Wake Island has no indigenous inhabitants its population consisting entirely of military and civilian contractors who maintain the airfield and facilities Wake Island lies in the tropical zone but is subject to periodic temperate storms during the winter. It receives little rainfall averaging fewer than 40 inches per annum; two water catchments and a distillation plant for seawater provide necessary water for inhabitants. The wettest season is from July through October. There is no wide variation in temperature on the island - yearly maximum is 95 degrees with the mean monthly temperatures running from 76 to 83°F. Typhoons occasionally pass over the island. All operations on the island were suspended and the United States Air Force evacuated all 188 residents (mostly American and Thai contractors for the Department of Defense who worked at the civilian base) on two C-17 Globemaster planes as Super Typhoon Ioke(category 5) headed toward Wake on August 28 the southwestern eyewall of the storm passed over the island with winds of more than 165 mph (265 km/h) gusting up to 185 mph (300 km/h) driving a storm surge and waves directly into the lagoon. A U.S. Air Force assessment and repair team returned to the island in September and restored limited function to the airfield and facilities leading ultimately to a full return to normal operations. The surface of the three islands is a smooth roll of disintegrated most numerous on Wilkes and the southern leg of Wake Island where they range to five or six feet in diameter. thick tropic shrub growth (often with thorns) and grasses are scattered through the islands and provide much opportunity for natural concealment. Vegetation is densest on the south leg of Wake Island west and south of the airfield. Trees sometimes reach a height of 20 to 25 feet palms found on most atolls are missing. The atoll's beaches are of white coral sand. At many places along the shoreline the beaches are strewn with jagged coral rocks and king-size boulders. Beaches vary in width from 20 to 170 yards but average 100 yards. The narrowest beaches are located on the north coast. Beach slope is quite gradual. Natural terraces or embankments exist only along the north coast except along the south shore of Wilkes. At the coastline or vegetation line there is frequently a moderate rise in elevation. Exits from the beaches are available at all points. The flightless Wake Island Rail was the island's only known nearly flightless ground-nesting shore/beachgrass land bird endemic to Wake Island. Last seen in the 1940s it is believed to have became cut off from resupply in 1944-1945 suggests that prior to European exploration traveled to what is now Wake Island (Kio) said to have been found on the atoll. rituals surrounding the tattooing of tribal chiefs were done using certain fresh human bones which required a human sacrifice. A man could save himself from being sacrificed if he obtained a wing bone from a certain very large seabird said to have existed on Small groups would therefore brave traveling to the atoll in hope of obtaining and returning with this bone for any man who completed the trip was rewarded; his life was spared and honor was bestowed by the chief. along with concepts of first-usage lands rights claims commonly held in as legitimate for settling indigenous land disputes a small separatist group of Marshall Island descendants who call themselves the Kingdom of EnenKio lay claim to Wake Island. The Marshall Islands and who also have competing claims over the island No evidence suggests there was ever a permanent settlement of Marshall Islanders on Wake Island for the land is too dry and not suitable for habitation. Álvaro de Mendaña de Neyra judged to be eight leagues in circumference "" to which he gave the name of ""San Francisco."" Originally searching to replenish their supplies of food and water Mendaña fixed it accurately in latitude and very badly in longitude placing it east of the Hawaiian group. The island was eventually named for Captain Samuel Wake the United States Exploring Expedition commanded by Commodore Charles Wilkes of the U.S. Navy landed on and surveyed Wake. Wilkes described the atoll as ""a low coral one of triangular form and eight feet above the surface. It has a large lagoon in the centre which was well filled with fish of a variety of species among these were some fine mullet."" He also noted that Wake had no fresh water and that it was covered with ""the most abundant of which was the "" (or tree heliotrope). The expedition's naturalist from a short-tailed albatross and various marine life specimens. Wake Island first received international attention with the wreck of the On the night of March 4 struck the eastern reef of Wake Island during a gale. The ship was under the command of Captain Tobias and en route from San Francisco with a cargo of over $300 singer Anna Bishop and three other members of an English opera troupe. the 30 stranded passengers and crew set sail in a 22-foot longboat and a gig for the then Spanish island of containing the opera troupe and other passengers arrived on Guam 18 days later. The gig was lost at sea. Once aware of their disappearance a schooner was sent out in search of the vessel. While stranded on Wake Island Captain Tobias had buried valuable cargo including 1 and precious stones worth approximately $145 and at least five ships conducted salvage operations in their recovery. The plight of the and cargo was reported by many newspapers. under the command of Captain Henry Vandervord en route to Sydney. On August 31 ""the weather was very thick and it was blowing a heavy gale from the eastward and a tremendous sea."" At 10:30 p.m. breakers were seen and the ship struck the reef at Wake Island. Overnight the vessel began to break up and at 10:00 a.m. the crew succeeded in launching the longboat over the leeward side. In the chaos of the evacuation the captain secured a chart and nautical instruments but no compass. The crew loaded a case of wine some bread and two buckets but no drinking water. Since Wake Island appeared to have neither food nor water the captain and his 12-man crew quickly departed crafting a makeshift sail by attaching a blanket to an oar. With no water each man was allotted a glass of wine per day until a heavy rain shower came on the sixth day. After 31 days of hardship drifting westward in the longboat they reached Kosrae (Strong's Island) in the Caroline Islands. Captain Vandervord attributed the loss of to the erroneous manner in which Wake Island ""is laid down in the charts. It is very low and not easily seen even on a clear night."" Wake Island was annexed by the Pan American Airways constructed a small village "" to service flights on its U.S.- clipper route. The village was the first human settlement on the island and relied upon the U.S. mainland for its food and water supplies; it remained in operation up to the day of the first Japanese air raid in the United States Navy constructed a military base on the atoll. On August 19 the first permanent military garrison elements of the 1st Marine Defense Battalion and Marine Fighting Squadron (VMF) 211 totaling 449 officers and men were stationed on the island commanded by Commander Winfield Scott Cunningham. Others on the island were 71 sailors a six-man Army signal detachment and about 1 They were armed with six used 5 inch (127 mm) cannons removed from a scrapped cruiser; twelve 3 inch (76.2 mm) M3 anti-aircraft guns (with only a single working anti-aircraft sight among them); 18 Browning M2 heavy machine guns; and 30 heavy in various conditions but all operational.

Even though Wake Island and Peale received numerous bomb salvos all of the Marine garrison's defensive emplacements were left intact by the raid which primarily targeted the naval aircraft. repelled several Japanese landing attempts. An American reported that after the initial Japanese amphibious assault was beaten back with heavy losses the American commander was asked by his superiors if he needed anything to which the commander sent back the message ""Send us more Japs! "" a reply which became a popular legend. However when Major Deveraux learned after the war that he was credited with that message he pointed out that he was not the commander and denied sending that message: ""As far as I know it wasn't sent at all. None of us was that much of a damn fool. We already had more Japs than we could handle."" USN was in charge of Wake Island Cunningham ordered that coded messages be sent during operations and a junior officer had added ""send us"" and ""more Japs"" to the beginning and end of a message to confuse Japanese code breakers. This was put together at Pearl Harbor and passed on as part of the message. The bombing raids - launched from Roi in the Kwajalein atoll some 700 miles south - continued for the next three days taking their toll on the island's defenders and grinding the Marine's fighter squadron down to four flyable planes. With these planes six 5-inch and twelve 3-inch anti-aircraft guns the Marines greeted the Japanese landing force that appeared early December 11. the garrison was eventually overwhelmed by the determined and numerically superior Japanese invasion force. They were captured and most were shipped to while 98 men were left on Wake to construct defenses for the Japanese. American casualties were 52 military personnel killed along with approximately 70 civilians. Japanese losses exceeded 700 killed with some estimates ranging as high as 900; in addition the Japanese lost four destroyers and 20 aircraft which much of the remnants can be found along the coastline and scattered about the island. In the aftermath of the battle some of the captured civilian laborers were pressed into service by the Japanese and tasked with improving the island's defenses. After a successful American air raid on October 5 the Japanese garrison commander Rear Admiral Shigematsu Sakaibara ordered the execution of the 98 prisoners on the pretext that they were . One prisoner escaped the mass execution but was later personally beheaded by Sakaibara. After the war Sakaibaira was tried for war crimes in 1947; his subordinate was sentenced to life in prison. one of the pilots from VMF-211 was awarded the United States posthumously for shooting down two out of twenty-two Japanese Zero fighters executing repeated bombing and strafing runs at extremely low altitude and close range succeeded in inflicting deadly damage upon a large Japanese vessel thereby sinking the first major warship to be destroyed by small caliber bombs delivered form a fighter-type aircraft. Many of his comrades were also highly decorated for their roles in the fighting. The Wake Island Device was created for American veterans of the battle. The Japanese-occupied island was bombed several times by American air forces; one of these raids was the first mission for future United States President Bush and another pilot received credit for sinking a small cargo ship. the remaining Japanese garrison surrendered to a detachment of the United States Marine Corps. In a brief ceremony the handover of Wake was officially conducted. began with the United States leading United Nations forces against a North Korean invasion of the Korean Airlift was started and the Military Air Transport Service (MATS) used the airfield and facilities at Wake as a key mid-Pacific refueling stop for its mission of transporting men and supplies to the Korean front. On October 15 and General MacArthur met at the Wake Island Conference to discuss progress and war strategy for the . They chose to meet at Wake Island because of its close proximity to so that MacArthur would not have to be away from the troops in the field for long. The island was used for strategic defense and operations during the . It was administered by the United States Army Space and Missile Defense Command (formerly known as the United States Army Space and Strategic Defense Command From late April until the middle of August 1975 Wake Island was used as a refugee camp temporary residence and processing center for tens of thousands of refugees who fled their homeland after the fall of Saigon ended the the island's airstrip has been used by the U.S. military and some commercial cargo planes as well as for emergency landings. There are over 700 landings a year on the island. There are also two offshore anchorages for large ships. On September 16 the World War II-related resources on Peale and Wake Islands were designated a National Historic Landmark and thereby also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Due to the U.S. Army's continued use of the atoll for various missile testing programs the U.S. Army Space and Strategic Defense Command (USASSDC) assumed administrative command of Wake Island under a caretaker permit from the U.S. Air Force. On October 1 administrative control and support of Wake Island was transferred from the U.S. Army to the U.S. Air Force's 15th Wing an aviation unit of Pacific Air Forces based at Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii. The 15th Wing had previously been in control of Wake from July 1 1994. Although the Air Force was once again in control the Missile Defense Agency would continue to operate the Wake Island Launch Center and the U.S. Army's Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site would continue to maintain and operate the launch facilities and also provide instrumentation Wake Island has no permanent inhabitants and access is restricted. However there are approximately 100 Air Force personnel and American and Thai contractor residents at any given time. The island remains a strategic location in the North and serves as an emergency landing location for transpacific flights. Many historic World War II facilities remain the most significant being the ""98 rock "" a large piece of coral standing in the lagoon inscribed ""98/U.S./P.W/5-10-43 "" a message carved by one of the 98 POW's later executed on Wake Island. Other significant remains include the U.S. Marine Corps command post and hospital bunkers the Japanese command post bunker tank traps and aircraft revetments. Only one artillery piece remains; an 8-inch British–made gun captured by the Japanese in and relocated to Wake Island. Ruins of the partially completed U.S. Naval Air Station also remain on Peale Island. Wake Island has no indigenous inhabitants but approximately 100 military personnel and civilian contractors maintain and operate the airfield and communications facilities.

Roy Frank Larson (thanks to Cynthia Larson Kline) Informal History of the Independence Hall Association Published by the National Park Service This history describes the efforts of the association to bring about Independence Mall and Independence National Historical Park. It also describes the roles of the key individuals in the association. The piece was written about 1951 who was the daughter of D. Knickerbacker Boyd. She played a major role in the association for 20 years first as an assistant to her father and after his death as the primary worker in the association. Source: Independence National Historical Park archives In 1941 Judge Edwin 0. Lewis was President of the Pennsylvania Society of Sons of the Revolution. Immediately after the Pearl Harbor attack and this country was in World War II Judge Lewis decided that some steps should be taken to protect Independence Hall Carpenters' Hall and other historic old buildings in downtown Philadelphia. He appointed a Committee on the protection of historic buildings and named as Chairman the late D. Knickerbacker Boyd well known as an architect and city planner together with a group of other distinguished citizens members of the Sons of the Revolution. The Insurance Company of North America which was organized in Independence Hall agreed to contribute the cost and arrange for the work of providing an underground steel and concrete pit and elevator so that the Liberty Bell could be quickly protected in the event of an air raid. It was then determined that the priceless historic buildings were subject to a great fire hazard due to the proximity to a large number of inflammable old buildings the district being counted a conflagration risk by the fire protection interests. Judge Lewis then determined to encourage the Committee to undertake a more ambitious program of eliminating the greater part of the fire risk by creating a historic park east of Independence Square. Later this was amplified to provide for the State Mall north of Independence Square to connect up with the Delaware River Bridge approach both for fire protection purposes and to facilitate the movement of out of town visitors to the historic shrines of old Philadelphia; as well as to beautify their enshrinement. This project was more ambitious than could be successfully undertaken by the Pennsylvania Society of the Sons of the Revolution alone and Judge Lewis and Mr. Boyd planned a larger organization of civic historic and patriotic organizations. Mr. Boyd sent out notices calling a meeting of representatives of 52 such organizations to plan for the ""conservation and improvement of historic Philadelphia."" Judge Lewis as President of the Sons of the Revolution presided at this meeting which was held in the Hall of the American Philosophical Society; a Committee of three members was appointed to make recommendations for the formation of a permanent organization and to present a slate of officers to be elected. Roy F. Larson was appointed Chairman of this Organization Committee the other two members being Dr. William E. Lingelbach and D. Knickerbacker Boyd. in the hall of the American Philosophical Society "" came into being with the officers elected in accordance with the slate presented by the Organization Committee. The Honorable Edwin 0. Lewis was elected President; the other officers included Miss Frances A. Wister Vice Presidents; Joseph F. Stockwell Treasurer; and D. Knickerbacker Boyd The newly formed Independence Hall Association at once set out with zeal to seek cooperation with City State and Federal authorities and to arouse public interest. By-laws were drawn stated meetings held in the buildings of its member organizations memberships increased from the 52 Founders to 275 individuals and organizations. Close collaboration was established with the City Planning Commission created by City councils in December 1942 and with the Philadelphia Chapter with full recourse to its valuable compilation of data on historic buildings in the city. Distinguished plans of the proposed development of the Independence Hall area plans which have served as a basis for all subsequent state and federal planning were drawn by the eminent Architect and Vice President of the Association Through the untiring efforts of Judge Lewis the Board of Directors and the small but inspired nucleus of members many of the dreams of city patriots and planners of the past 50 years have already been or are in the process of being enacted into state and federal laws. The Independence Hall Association thus organized was completely non-political Judge Lewis immediately opened negotiations with the Mayor and City Council to have the Independence Hall group of buildings declared a national shrine under the Act of Congress; and the Department of the Interior agreed upon a form of contract and this was signed in 1943. The contract continued in effect until January when a new contract became effective by which the custody of the Independence Square and the Independence Hall group of buildings was legally transferred to the National Park Service of the Department of the Interior; this has resulted in immediate substantial improvements made for the preservation and beautification of Independence Hall Congress Hall and the Federal Court House at Fifth and Chestnut streets. Arrangements are now being consummated for the Federal Government to spend $50 000.00 in erecting suitable public conveniences underground adjacent to Congress Hall; thus filling a long time need to accommodate visitors. long disturbed by the dangerous congestion of buildings that threatened the safety of Independence Hall envisaged a beautiful Mall; one a full block wide that should sweep from these sacred portals clear to the entrance of the Delaware River Bridge one that should eliminate fire hazards and provide a suitably dignified approach to this most treasured Landmark. In the words of Dr. William Lingelbach distinguished historian and vice president of the Independence Hall Association Governor Martin and the Legislature at Harrisburg already concerned about the lack of dignified approaches to Independence Hall and the fire hazards from antiquated buildings on the north were induced to set aside a sum of from four to eight million dollars for a great Concourse between Fifth and Sixth Streets from Race Street at the Delaware River bridgehead to Independence Square. By the acquisition of the properties in these nine city blocks and their demolition to make room for landscaping and the reconstruction of historic buildings an appropriate and dignified approach to the National Shrine from the north will be created. ""The federal park to the east of Independence Hall to be known as the Independence National Historical Park Project ""as a means of reclaiming some of the neighborhood around the old State House now a decaying commercial area ridden with parking lots. Under the leadership of Judge Edwin 0. Lewis as president of the Independence Hall Association and Chairman of two special Federal Commissions widespread public interest and support were aroused. Bills passed by Congress in 1948 and 1949 established the project appropriated a half million dollars in cash and authorized contracts to the extent of $3 000 more for the purchase of land. The area will officially become a national historical park and ready for the reception of visitors by the National Park Service when certain important historic buildings and two-thirds of the total of the lands have been acquired."" Members of the original Federal Commission to which Mr. Peterson refers or Advisory Board of eleven members working with the National Park Service was appointed by Secretary of the Interior Krug in 1949 upon the recommendation of three by the Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania three by the Mayor of the City of Philadelphia and one each by the Carpenters' Company and the Independence Hall Association. The members are: Chairman Judge Edwin 0. Lewis; Vice-Chairman Michael J. Bradley; Members: Thomas Buckley In the nine years since the formation of the Independence Hall Association Judge Lewis and the supporters o this great civic project have been called constantly to Washington to appear at hearings directed by Dr. Drury Dean of the National Park Service department of Public Lands and other Legislative Committee Hearings. With groups of the officers and directors of the Independence Hall Association and leaders of affiliated civic City Planning and Patriotic organizations the Judge has made many trips to Harrisburg to present testimony before Legislative Committees and Sub-Committees; before the Joint State Government Commission; Chief Engineer of the Department of Highways E. L. Schmidt; and the Secretary Department of Forests and Waters Admiral Milo Draemel; and before the Governors of the State of Pennsylvania the Honorable Edward G. Martin the Honorable James H. Duff and the Honorable John S. Fine. Judge Lewis has testified repeatedly before Philadelphia City Councils and has organized open meetings o interested Citizenry in the Chambers of his Honor as Honorary President of the Independence Hall Association has been a staunch and active supporter from its formation.

From 1942 to the present date as the project has become recognized as one of the utmost importance to city President Lewis and Vice-President Roy Larson have given generously of their time to address interested civic and patriotic groups on the plans and progress of both the State and Federal Malls. the Association has arranged numerous Exhibits particularly outstanding that in 1943 of early Philadelphia prints and documents in old Congress Hall under the supervision of Historians Mrs. Joseph Carson and Mr. Joseph McCosker. had a large landscaped model made of the proposed Park Areas which aroused wide-spread public interest when displayed on the main aisle of the John Wanamaker Store again when in the great city Planning Exhibit in the Gimbel Store later when in the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society's Flower and Landscaping show and finally when placed on permanent exhibition in the Old Congress Hall. Several times during its nine years the Association has arranged to have printed and widely distributed to interested groups and to legislative Committees certain pamphlets depicting its activities. Particularly influential was the distinguished brochure prepared and financed in 1945 by the Fairmount Park Art Association under the direction of its President in the Independence Hall Movement. In spite of slow and often disappointing progress and in the face of many seemingly unsurmountable obstacles Judge Lewis has maintained the same enthusiastic zeal and indomitable spirit that has characterized his leadership from the start. Many of the buildings in the block to the north of the Hall have already been demolished. Within the next twelve months due to the unfailing efforts of the Independence Hall Association and in a mere ten years from its formation many significant changes will actually become visible in the historic area of the Nation's foremost Shrine.

1620763555.629152,33428849,https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Nicholas_II_of_Russia,") was the last tsar of Russia and Grand Duke of Finland. He ruled from 1894 until his forced abdication in 1917. Nicholas proved unable to manage a country in political turmoil and to command its army during . His rule ended with the after which he and his family were executed by Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias though his full title was “We by the grace of God Emperor and Autocrat of all the Russias and Grand Duke of Smolensk and other territories; Lord and Grand Duke of Nizhny Novgorod and all northern territories; Ruler of Iveria and the Kabardinian lands and territories; hereditary Ruler and Lord of the Cherkess and Mountain Princes and others; Lord of Turkestan He is sometimes referred to as due to his execution and as because of the Khodynka Tragedy during his coronation and his government's suppression of dissent. Subsequent to his he has been regarded as Nicholas was born in Saint Petersburg the second eldest son of Tsar and Maria Fyodorovna (born Princess Dagmar of Denmark). His paternal grandparents were and his first consort Maria Alexandrovna of Hesse. His maternal grandparents were Christian IX of Denmark and Louise of Hesse-Kassel. His older brother Alexander who would have been Tsar Alexander IV had he lived Nicholas did not have an easy childhood. He was constantly bullied by his father who did not appreciate Nicholas's shy and sensitive disposition. In front of his friends his father called him a ""girly girl."" His mother was a clinging possessive woman who spoiled Nicholas. Nicholas fell in love with the Princess Alix a daughter of Louis IV and Princess Alice of the United Kingdom the latter a daughter of Queen and Prince Albert. Alexander III did not approve of this match; hoping to cement Russia's new alliance with he had hoped that Nicholas would marry Princess Hélène the daughter of Count Philippe of the House of Orleans. Nicholas did a considerable amount of traveling. During a notable trip to the Empire of Japan a failed assassination attempt by a sword-wielding man left him with a scar on his forehead. The quick action of his cousin who parried the second blow with his cane possibly saved his life. The motivations for this attack remain unclear. Coronation: Anointing of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia. Painting by Valentin Serov Deemed overly soft by his hard and demanding father Nicholas received little grooming for his imperial role. When Alexander died at the age of 49 in 1894 of kidney disease after an unexpectedly rapid deterioration of health Nicholas felt so unprepared for the duties of the crown that he tearfully asked his cousin ""What is going to happen to me and all of Russia?"" He nevertheless decided to maintain the conservative policies favored by his father. While Alexander had concentrated on the formulation of general policy Nicholas devoted much more attention to the details of administration. Historians including Binjamin Segel in his book A Lie and a Libel: The History of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion have stated that during this period Nicholas commissioned the publication of the anti-Semitic book The Protocols of the Elders of Zion to discredit Nicholas's political opponents as members of a worldwide Jewish conspiracy. Under the pressure of the Russian Revolution of 1905 issued a manifesto about the convocation of the Duma (Legislature) initially thought to be an advisory organ. In the subsequent October Manifesto Nicholas pledged to introduce basic civil liberties provide for broad participation in the and endow the Duma with legislative and oversight powers. Nicholas's relations with the Duma were not good. The First Duma with a majority of Constitutional Democratic Party almost immediately came into conflict with him. Although Nicholas initially had a good relationship with his relatively liberal prime minister and as the political situation deteriorated Nicholas dissolved the Duma. Witte unable to grasp the seemingly insurmountable problems of reforming Russia and the monarchy wrote to Nicholas on April 14 other accounts have said that Witte was forced to resign by the tsar). Nicholas was not ungracious to Witte and an imperial rescript was published on April 22 naming Witte a Knight of the Order of Saint (The last two words were written in the tsar's own hand followed by ""I remain unalterably well-disposed to you and sincerely grateful After the second Duma resulted in similar problems (whom Witte described as “reactionary”) unilaterally dissolved it and changed the electoral laws to allow for future Dumas to have a more conservative content and to be dominated by the liberal-conservative Octobrist Party of Alexander Guchkov. Stolypin had ambitious plans for reform. These included making loans available to the lower classes to enable them to buy land with the intent of forming a farming class loyal to the crown. His plans were undercut by conservatives at court who had more influence with the tsar. By the time of Stolypin's assassination by Dmitry Bogrov a Jewish student (and police informant) in a theatre in Kiev on September 18 he and the tsar were barely on speaking terms and his fall was widely foreseen. Further complicating domestic matters was the matter of the succession. Alexandra bore Nicholas four daughters before their son was born on August 12 1904. The young heir proved to be afflicted with a hereditary disease that prevents the blood from clotting properly. At the time hemophilia was virtually untreatable and usually led to an untimely death. As a granddaughter of Queen Victoria mutation that afflicted some of the imperial houses of Europe known as ""the royal disease "" and thus had passed it on to her son. Silver Coin of Tsar Nicholas II with the Romanov crest on the reverse. Because of the fragility of the autocracy at this time Nicholas and Alexandra chose not to divulge Alexei's condition to anyone outside the royal household. In fact there were many in the imperial household who were unaware of the exact nature of the tsarevich's illness; they merely knew that he suffered from some serious malady. Alexandra sought help from a mystic . Rasputin seemed to help when Alexei was suffering from internal bleeding and Alexandra became increasingly dependent on him and his advice which she accepted as coming directly from . It has been widely speculated that Rasputin was able to use hypnosis on the young boy as a means of calming him and thus helping to stem the flow of blood to the injured body part. Rasputin was known to have been studying hypnosis in St. Petersburg as late as 1913 but he was discovered by Stephen Beletsky the head of the Special Police detachment that monitored all of Rasputin's activities. He was expelled from the city by the police. Rasputin was murdered by Grand Duke Dmitri and other conspirators in December 1916 and drowned in the river. It was the latter which became the cause of his death. Following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria by Gavrilo Princip a member of the Serb nationalist association known as the Black Hand in Sarajevo on June 28 Nicholas was hesitant about what Russia's course of action would be. The rising ideas of Pan-Slavism had led Russia to issue treaties of protection to Serbia. Nicholas wanted neither to abandon nor to provoke a general war. In a series of letters exchanged with the German Kaiser (the so-called ""Willy and Nick correspondence"") the two proclaimed their desire for peace and each attempted to get the other to back down. Nicholas took stern measures in this regard demanding that Russia's mobilization be only against the Austrian border in the hopes of preventing war with the German Empire. It proved too late for personal communications to determine the course of events. Nicholas II of Russia painted by Earnest Lipgart The Russians had no contingency plans for a partial mobilization under political pressure from abroad and military pressure at home took the fateful step of confirming the order for a general mobilization. As Germany and Austria-Hungary had mutual defense treaties in place this led almost immediately to a German mobilization and declaration of war The outbreak of war on August 1 yet an immediate attack was ordered against the German province of East Prussia. The Germans mobilized there with great efficiency and completely defeated the two Russian armies which had invaded. The Russian armies later had considerable success against both the Austro-Hungarian armies and against the forces of the Gradually a war of erosion set in on the vast Eastern Front where the Russians were facing the combined forces of the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires and they suffered staggering losses. Nicholas feeling that it was his duty and that his personal presence would inspire his troops decided to lead his army directly. He assumed the role of commander-in-chief after dismissing his cousin from that position the highly respected and experienced Grand Duke Nicholas following the loss of the Russian Kingdom of His efforts to oversee the war left domestic issues essentially in the hands of Alexandra. Being of German heritage she was unpopular and the Duma was constantly calling for political reforms. Political unrest continued throughout the war. Cut off from public opinion Nicholas did not understand how suspicious the common people were of his wife who was also the victim of destructive rumors about her dependence on . Nicholas had refused to censor the press and wild rumors and accusations about Alexandra and Rasputin appeared almost daily. Angry at the damage that Rasputin's influence was doing to Russia's war effort and to the monarchy led by Prince Felix Yusupov murdered Rasputin on December 16 The government's inability to maintain constant supplies and an active economy over a prolonged period of warfare led to mounting national hardship. The army's initial failure to maintain the temporary military successes up to June 1916 led to renewed strikes and riots in the following winter. With Nicholas away at the front in 1915 and St. Petersburg was left in the hands of strikers and mutinying conscript soldiers. At the end of the February Revolution of 1917 Nicholas II was forced to abdicate. He issued the following statement: In the days of the great struggle against the foreign enemies who for nearly three years have tried to enslave our fatherland the Lord God has been pleased to send down on Russia a new heavy trial. Internal popular disturbances threaten to have a disastrous effect on the future conduct of this persistent war. The destiny of Russia the honor of our heroic army the welfare of the people and the whole future of our dear fatherland demand that the war should be brought to a victorious conclusion whatever the cost. The cruel enemy is making his last efforts and already the hour approaches when our glorious army together with our gallant allies will crush him. In these decisive days in the life of Russia We thought it Our duty of conscience to facilitate for Our people the closest union possible and a consolidation of all national forces for the speedy attainment of victory. In agreement with the Imperial Duma We have thought it well to renounce the Throne of the Russian Empire and to lay down the supreme power. As We do not wish to part from Our beloved son We transmit the succession to Our brother the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich and give Him Our blessing to mount the Throne of the Russian Empire. We direct Our brother to conduct the affairs of state in full and inviolable union with the representatives of the people in the legislative bodies on those principles which will be established by them and on which He will take an inviolable oath. In the name of Our dearly beloved homeland We call on Our faithful sons of the fatherland to fulfill their sacred duty to the fatherland to obey the tsar in the heavy moment of national trials together with the representatives of the people to guide the Russian Empire on the road to victory and glory. May the Lord God help Russia! Grand Duke Michael declined to accept the throne which then theoretically fell vacant pending a decision on the next rightful heir. Contrary to popular belief as he was never formally crowned. The abdication of Nicholas II and the subsequent revolution brought three centuries of the Romanov dynasty's rule to an end. The provisional Russian government at first kept Nicholas and their children confined in the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoe Selo 15 miles south of St. Petersburg. Attempting to remove them from the vicinity of the capital and so from possible harm government moved them east to Tobolsk in Siberia in August 1917. They remained there through the Bolshevik but were then moved to Red Army and Bolshevik-controlled Yekaterinburg. The tsar and his family Kharitonov and Trupp were executed at 2:33 A.M. on the morning of July 17 1918. According to Yakov Yurovsky he read to Nicholas a letter from the Presidium of the Ural Regional Soviet saying: In view of the fact that your relatives continue their offensive against Soviet Russia the Presidium of the Ural Regional Soviet has decided to sentence you to death. oh my God! Oh my God! What is this? I can't understand you. The bodies were disposed in a truck which Yurovsky ordered at midnight and taken to the forest to be disposed. The execution was covered up as a disappearance for a while.
Soon after the Bolsheviks announced that only Nicholas had been shot but that the members of his family had been spirited away to another place. Most reports showed that they had all been executed by a detachment of Bolsheviks led by Yakov Yurovsky a watchmaker from Perm. Other witnesses swore to have seen the tsarina and her daughters in Perm. King Alfonso XIII of Spain negotiated with the new Soviet government interceding for the remaining members of the family that he thought to be alive. The last known photograph of Nicholas II taken after his abdication in March 1917 Yakov Yurovsky's own report was published which seemed to show conclusively what had happened that night. The execution took place as units of the Czechoslovak Legion making their retreat out of Russia approached Yekaterinburg. Fearing that the Legion would take the town and free him jailers pursued the immediate liquidation of the imperial family arguing that there was ""no turning back."" The telegram giving the order on behalf of the Supreme Soviet in Moscow was signed by Jacob Sverdlov after whom the town was subsequently renamed. Nicholas was the first to die. He was executed with multiple bullets to the head and chest. The bodies of Nicholas and his family after being soaked in acid and burned were long believed to have been disposed of down a mine shaft at a site called the Four Brothers. Initially this was true — they had indeed been disposed of there on the night of July 17. The following morning when rumors spread in Yekaterinburg regarding the disposal site Yurovsky removed the bodies and concealed them elsewhere. When the vehicle carrying the bodies broke down on the way to the next chosen site and buried most of the bodies in a sealed and hidden pit on Koptyaki Road a cart track (now abandoned) 12 miles north of Yekaterinburg. Their remains were later found in 1991 and reburied by the Russian government following a state funeral. The process to identify the remains was exhaustive. Samples were sent to Britain and the United States for DNA testing. The tests concluded that five of the skeletons were members of one family and four were unrelated. Three of the five were determined to be the children of two parents. The mother was linked to the British royal family. The father was determined to be related to Grand Duke George Alexandrovich younger brother of Nicholas II. British scientists said they were more than ninety-eight percent sure that the remains were those of the tsar his family and their attendants. Relics from the Otsu Scandal (the failed assassination attempt in Japan on Tsarevich Nicholas future Nicholas II) proved unhelpful due to contamination. A ceremony of Christian Burial was held in 1998 and the bodies were laid to rest with State honors in a special chapel in the Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg. the 13-year-old heir to the throne; and one of his sisters either Maria or Anastasia. Grand Duchess received worldwide notoriety before the bodies were even found when rumors spread that she alone had survived the execution. has made films based on this legend. Anna Anderson who helped to fuel these rumors and gained a measure of notoriety through her claims to be Anastasia and her supporters claimed she knew information about the Romanovs that only an intimate member of the family would know. However DNA testing on Anna Anderson's remains indicated she was an imposter. The Russian Orthodox Church refused to acknowledge the remains as genuine. During the interment of the bones in 1998 the remains were referred to by the Church as “Christian victims of the Revolution” rather than as the royal family. One reason for this dispute was the absence of any mark from Nicholas's saber wound he received in Japan. Tests done by Japanese scientists showed that the blood of Nicholas's nephew Tikhon did not match with the published profile of Nicholas. A Stanford study done in 2003 suggested some sort of contamination. forensic anthropologist William Maples stated that he discovered the skeletons of the royal family. The authors of a 2004 have stated that the DNA results to date have not been conclusive. The children of Tsar Nicholas II and Tsarina Alexandra as follows: executed at Yekaterinberg by the Bolsheviks executed at Yekaterinberg by the Bolsheviks executed at Yekaterinberg by the Bolsheviks executed at Yekaterinberg by the Bolsheviks executed at Yekaterinberg by the Bolsheviks Icon of the Romanov Tsar family In 1981 Nicholas and his immediate family were by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia as martyrs. On August 14 2000 they were canonized by the synod of the . They were not named martyrs since their death did not result immediately from their Christian faith; instead they were canonized as passion bearers. According to a statement by the Moscow synod they were glorified as saints for the following reasons: In the last Orthodox Russian monarch and members of his family we see people who sincerely strove to incarnate in their lives the commands of the Gospel. In the suffering borne by the Royal Family in prison with humility and in their martyrs deaths in Ekaterinburg in the night of July 17 1918 was revealed the light of the faith of Christ that conquers evil.

Doug had the unique talent of being able to size up a problem and present it in a coherent and thoughtful way. Certainly his most enjoyable part of ushistory.org is the section. Tired of Congress constantly proposing a Flag Desecration constitutional amendment Doug set out to ask the question ""What is a flag?"" By pointing out all the different interpretations of the U.S. flag that are used in our society and the way most of them violate the (unenforceable) U.S. Flag Code Doug felt that he helped change the national conversation about flag desecration.

Ironically the actual location of the house and the slave quarters is just steps from the building that houses the Liberty Bell. Doug and Ed worked with local advocacy groups including Avenging the Ancestors Coalition to bring attention to this information. In December 2010 the National Park Service opened an interpretation of the President's House including a full discussion of the slaves who lived there. Doug was a very ""behind the scenes"" man using his many talents to educate and help people through his websites. His work was done on a volunteer basis for many years.

There are also public virtues that characterize the spirit of a nation and peace. Every culture has its lists of virtues such as the biblical ""fruits of the (忠; loyalty). These define what people regard as most valuable in a human being. dealt with virtues in terms of character traits of the . They held that virtues are conducive to personal and social while lack of virtue leads to suffering and downfall. The world's universally encourage people to cultivate virtues and attribute their source to ultimate reality ( ). Plato likewise rooted virtue in a higher reality . Every culture on earth is grounded in teachings and practices that cultivate personal virtue in order to promote social and moral so that people may be able to live peacefully on earth and beyond. Virtue as a concept in philosophical ethics the notion of virtue played a central role in ethical theory up until the virtues took something of a back seat after the emergence of as philosophers focused less on dispositions of character and more on the rightness or wrongness of actions. Recent years have seen a revival of what is called following the Greek tradition of Plato and Aristotle. in the world recognize the importance of and all cultivate a self-discipline and social and moral for the sake of happiness and peaceful living on earth and beyond. (the path of righteousness) as the first chief aim of human life encouraging us to cultivate virtues and do good deeds in order for us to be liberated from the chain of teaches: ""O Arjuna there never exists destruction for one in this life nor in the next life; since dear friend anyone who is engaged in virtuous acts never comes to evil.""

Virtues are modes of is a course on virtuous living on the path of righteousness which would lead to the cessation of ). Buddhism has a few other ways of classifying virtues. It has the four known also as the four ""immeasurables"" ( (equanimity); and they may be more properly regarded as virtues in the European sense. has developed the Ten Perfections ( shown in the second chapter of the (equanimity). A stress on the importance of such virtues can be seen in the following passage in the part of the Pali Canon: ""Sandal-wood or Tagara among these sorts of perfumes the perfume of virtue is unsurpassed."" Mahayana Buddhism lists the Six Perfections ( (wisdom). Four more Perfections are listed in Mahayana Buddhism's is an important concept in Chinese religions originally meant normative ""virtue"" in the sense of ""personal character "" but semantically changed to moral ""virtue or morality."" Note the semantic parallel for English ""virtue "" with an archaic meaning of ""inner potency or divine power"" (as in ""by virtue of"") and a modern one of ""moral excellence or goodness."" In Daoism referring to the lifestyle of (無為; non-action) that an individual is expected to realize in order that he may return to nature and allow the (""The Way"") to unfold in the manner that it is meant to unfold. This non-action is reflected in the three basic virtues called (三寶; three jewels) in the 67th chapter of (不敢為天下先; not daring to be ahead of all under heaven or humility in a concise form). Confucianism played a key role by presenting its teaching of virtues to Far Eastern countries such as as they built their social systems. Confucian moral manifestations of virtue include had the archaic meaning of ""virility"" in the Confucian Book of Poems and then progressively took on shades of ethical meaning. Confucius considers these virtues to be connected with the without whose knowledge one cannot become a superior man. One important normative value in much of Chinese thinking is that one's social status should result from the amount of virtue that one demonstrates rather than from one's birth. is not simply about following rules. When teaching these commandments it actually aims at fostering moral virtues in the hearts of people so that human relationships may become more for the betterment of the world. So one striking virtue taught in Judaism is compassion . It is indicated in the repeated injunctions in the Hebrew Bible that the widow and the stranger shall be protected. Kindness to the poor is another example and it is considered to be repaid by God ( 19:17). In the teaching that ""you shall love your neighbor as yourself"" ( ""neighbor"" can be a stranger and does not mean an Israelite exclusively (Leviticus 19:34). and impartiality are stressed (Leviticus 19:15 ethics involves virtues such as reverence for parents (Exodus 20:12) and . Renowned in the Jewish tradition as a sage and a scholar he is associated with the development of the one of the most important figures in Jewish history. Asked for a summary of the Jewish religion in the most concise terms Hillel replied (reputedly while standing on one leg): ""What is hateful to you do not to your neighbor: That is the whole Torah while the rest is the commentary thereof; go and learn it."" as the word of God the great repository of all virtues in earthly form is the exemplar of virtue in human form. The very name of Islam "" proclaims the virtue of submission to the will of God the acceptance of the way things are. Foremost among God's attributes are mercy and compassion or in the canonical language of Arabic . Each of the 114 chapters of the Qur'an ""In the name of God the Compassionate the Merciful."" A good Muslim is to commence each day and each significant action by invoking God the Merciful and Compassionate urge compassion towards captives as well as to widows a toll tax to help the poor and needy was obligatory upon all Muslims (Qur'an 9:60). One of the practical purposes of fasting or is to help one empathize with the hunger pangs of those less fortunate to enhance sensitivity to the suffering of others and develop compassion for the poor and destitute. The list of Muslim virtues is a long one: prayer there are three theological virtues: among which the greatest is love ( 13:13). The ""theological"" virtues are so named because their immediate object is . The Bible also lists several virtues as the ""fruit"" of the These biblical lists of virtues are accepted to all Christians. and additionally comes up with what it calls ""natural"" virtues as adopted by theologians such as . These four virtues from Plato are called ""cardinal"" virtues ( ""hinge""). The three theological virtues and the four cardinal virtues together constitute the so-called ""seven virtues"" of Catholic theology. These seven virtues are to be distinguished from the seven holy virtues ( which the poet Prudentius (348-c.410 ) in his descriptions of battles between the virtues and vices contrasted with the corresponding the supernatural virtues differ from all other virtues in that they can be obtained only by being supernaturally ""infused"" through divine grace and not by human effort. According to Thomas Aquinas non-Christian people can not display the supernatural virtues although they can manifest the other natural virtues such as fortitude. However Aquinas seems to hold that all the natural virtues are subordinate and grounded in the virtue called charity which is the supernatural queen of the virtues. specific lists of virtues became influential in various (the Roman Way). They gave the citizens of the the moral strength to conquer and civilize the world. Private virtues (truthfulness). Distinguished from personal virtues were public virtues to be shared by all of society in common (safety). Many of the public virtues were personified as Traditional schools of Chinese martial arts base martial arts on a system of has two aspects: the morality of deed and the morality of mind which is meant to cultivate inner harmony within oneself and whose ultimate goal is to reach (無為; non-action). This martial morality spread to . The morality of deed includes virtues such as (信用; trust). The morality of mind includes virtues were developed as the code of the samurai in the (武士道; way of the warrier) during the The central seven virtues of the Bushido code were: (忠; loyalty). Others that were sometimes added to these were which he called ""moral perfection."" He kept a checklist in a notebook to measure each day how he lived up to them. They became known through his autobiography and inspired many people all around the world. Authors and speakers in the self-help movement report being influenced by him. For example Anthony Robbins based a part of his ""Date with Destiny"" seminar on Franklin's concept. Franklin's list is as follows: . Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation. Silence. Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation. Order. Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time. Resolution. Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve. Frugality. Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e. Industry. Lose no Time; be always employ'd in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions. Sincerity. Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly . Wrong none by doing injuries or omitting the benefits that are your duty. Moderation. Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve. Cleanliness. Tolerate no uncleanness in body Tranquility. Be not disturbed at trifles or at accidents common or unavoidable. . Rarely use venery but for health or offspring or the injury of your own or another's peace or reputation. there are a number of that promote virtues for the betterment of society. For example founded in 1991 based on the conviction that ""Virtues are the very meaning and purpose of our lives the content of our character and the truest expression of our souls"" is a worldwide organization with some inter-religious flavor so that they may be helped ""to live authentic to raise children of compassion and idealism and to create a culture of character in our schools and communities."" Virtue as a concept in philosophical ethics one of the two central concepts in ) are character states of the etc. Each virtue ensures that its possessor acts in the correct ways pertaining to a situation that he or she might encounter over a life. Possessing the virtues ensures that one practices good ( 's writings was the first in the Western intellectual tradition to make a serious investigation into the subject matter of virtue. What is known of Socrates' philosophy is almost entirely derived from Plato's Socratic dialogues. Scholars typically divide Plato's works into three periods: the early and late periods. They tend to agree also that Plato's earliest works quite faithfully represent the teachings of Socrates and that Plato's own views which go beyond those of Socrates appear for the first time in the middle works such as professional rhetoricians who promoted moral one of the major Sophists argued that good and evil are a matter of interpretation. Some Sophists even held a arguing that good and evil are determined by a winner. Thus the Sophists generally promoted a view of value based upon power consists in the world of eternal beyond the world of everyday reality. It transcends human interpretations. Eternal truth is both transcendent of and immanent in the at the same time because people cannot really grasp it while they are aware of it. The soul is not some kind of ghostly at all but rather the the structure of which is at least aware of eternal truth so that it may have true of eternal truth. Virtue indeed consists in the cultivation of the soul in this sense. Therefore virtue means knowledge of eternal truth on the part of the soul. Conversely virtue relates to the form of the Good; to truly be good and not just act with ""right opinion "" one must come to know the unchanging Good in itself. Socrates seems to have maintained that there is strictly only one virtue which is knowledge of eternal truth. This is sometimes called his doctrine of the unity of the virtues. In Plato's dialogue Protagoras defends the view that virtues are distinct traits so that a person can possess one virtue without possessing the others (329d-e). For example and some are wise without being courageous. Socrates argues against this maintaining that apparently separate virtues such as wisdom are in some way one and the same thing. His view seems to be that the distinction between virtues is nothing other than the distinction between different spheres of application of the same state of knowledge. Given this unity of the virtues it follows that a person cannot possess one virtue independently of the others: If he possesses one he must possess them all. 's view of virtue may be understood as a development of Plato shows his tripartite conception of the which he developed from common experience of internal confusion and conflict within the soul. Reason seeks the true goal of human life in view of eternal and spirit is the drive that is neutral at first but responds to the direction of reason. But for the things of the body. The soul can achieve order and peace only if the rational part is in control of the irrational parts of spirit and appetite. But after the soul enters the body the body stimulates the irrational parts to defeat the rulership of reason. Hence disorder happens of eternal truth is lost. Plato calls the regaining of this knowledge ""recollection"" ( ) and relates it to the regaining of reason's control over spirit and appetite. So Plato believes that knowledge is virtue. Corresponding to the three parts of the soul there are three distinguishable virtues: and temperance. The virtue of wisdom is achieved when reason remains undisturbed by the irrational parts of the soul to see eternal truth in the Forms especially the Good. The virtue of courage is achieved when the energy of will follows the direction of reason aggressively yet defensively even in situations of trial avoiding headlong or rash action. The virtue of temperance is attained when appetite is kept within limits and in its measure avoiding excesses in pleasures and desires so that they may not dominate the other parts of the soul. Plato also talks about a fourth virtue . The virtue of justice is attained when each part of the soul fulfills its function. For justice means giving to each part its own due. The attainment of justice means that the soul achieves not only inner is by far the most influential of the ancient accounts of the virtues. The fact that many modern thinkers consider themselves to be ""neo-Aristotelians"" is testimony to this fact. Unlike so that it can not only be known by studying human nature but also be attained through practice. According to Aristotle of the human self has three parts: the rational (which is distinctively human) the appetitive (which is shared with and the vegetative (which is shared with ). What is pertinent to human is the relationship between the rational and appetitive parts of the soul. Although the appetitive part in and by itself is irrational nevertheless it is also rational as long as it is under the control of the rational as long as there is the rational ability of the soul to control appetitive desires. Indeed moral virtues consist in various forms of the rational ability of the soul in this sense. So ""in the continent man it obeys the rational principle and presumably in the temperate and brave man it is still more obedient."" These moral virtues are each not but learned through teaching and practice to become a habit ( a slight linguistic variation of which has given rise to the word "" ). Unlike Plato's idea that virtue is basically knowledge alone Aristotle's understanding is that each virtue involves the self-control of the soul in addition to rational knowledge. Aristotle considers many more moral virtues than Plato and includes virtues such as magnificence moral virtues are character traits. Most moral virtues are to be understood as falling at the mean between two vices the two extremes of defect and excess. For example the virtue of courage is the mean between cowardice (defect) and rashness (excess). This is called the doctrine of the mean. Aristotle posits virtues of another kind which consist in purely rational abilities of the soul unrelated to controlling the appetitive part. They are intellectual virtues and they include ""philosophical wisdom"" of first principles ( ) and ""practical wisdom"" of the good ( ). While the moral virtues can lead us to the intellectual virtues constitute even higher forms of happiness. moral theorizing has shifted its focus from the issue of what sort of person one should be to that of what one ought to do. Thus the main questions to be addressed have become: What actions should one perform and which actions are right and which ones wrong? Questions such as: Which traits of character ought one to develop? and Which traits of character are virtues have been ignored. For instance one ought to do actions that promote the greatest for the greatest number of people. The principle of utility is a criterion of rightness and one's motive in acting has nothing to do with the rightness of an action. Similarly one ought to act only on maxims that can consistently be willed as universal laws. Kant does give motivation a central place in his theory of according to which the morally virtuous person is someone who is disposed to act from the motive of of someone who always does the right thing from the desire to do the right thing may not be an accurate picture of the virtues of the moral agent's character. This trend after the Enlightenment continued until the middle of the twentieth century. Interest in the concept of virtue and ancient ethical theory more generally has enjoyed a tremendous revival in the twentieth century. This is largely as a result of "" which argues that duty-based conceptions of morality are incoherent because they are based on the idea of a law but without a lawgiver. Her point is roughly that a system of morality conceived along the lines of the as a system of rules for action depends on someone having actually made these rules. However which is unwilling to accept that morality depends on a rule-based conception of morality is stripped of its foundation. Anscombe recommends a return to the the interests and well-being of human moral agents and can do so without appeal to any questionable metaphysics. The primary focus of this virtue ethics is not discrete actions but rather: What sort of person should one be or want to be? The focus is the agent's character. Many philosophers today follow ancient ethical thinkers such as in situating virtue at the centre of their ethical theories. They criticize by stating that both neglect the importance of moral motivation or provide a distorted conception of moral motivation. As a result has come to be recognized as a promising alternative to utilitarianism and Kantianism in the sphere of normative theory. . Most modern thinkers adopt Aristotle's view that virtues are flexible traits of character which are displayed in specific types of actions as well as cognitive and emotional reactions. This conception of virtues may be explained by considering its various components in turn. virtues are states of a person's character. Judging someone to be is to make a judgment targeted at the character of a person rather than specific actions. One calls actions right and wrong but when one says that a person is generous one is making a claim about the moral worth of the person concerned. One is saying that he or she possesses a certain virtuous trait of character. a virtue is a disposition of a person's character. A disposition is a tendency to have certain responses in particular situations: Responses such as emotions . It is important to notice that the idea of a disposition is made out in terms of the situations in which certain characteristics would be displayed. To say that a person is a generous man is to say more than he has behaved generously in the past. If he has the virtue of generosity then he will very likely behave generously in situations in which generosity is called for. This has something to do with enduring patterns of response which characterize a person when he or she is in situations of a given type. the possession of a virtue entails a wide range of responses including actions attitudes and emotions. In this vein Rosalind Hursthouse helpfully characterizes virtues as multi-track dispositions. She says: ""A virtue is not merely a tendency to do what is morally desirable or required. Rather it is to have a complex mindset. This includes emotions A person who fully possesses a virtue is effortlessly moved by the range of considerations pertinent to the situation in which he or she acts and displays the emotions particular to the virtue in question. This is to recognize a distinction drawn by Aristotle between the virtuous person and the strong-willed person who acts correctly but has to control his desires and emotions which are not properly tuned to the display of the virtue in question. The main point is that a full virtue requires a between one's actions and emotions and attitudes. Someone who does not possess this harmony may act correctly but will nonetheless fail to be (fully) virtuous. the contemporary account diverges from 's conception in a number of ways. Firstly the scope of virtue in the contemporary account is not as broad as that in Aristotle's conception. The Greek word is usually translated into English as ""virtue."" One problem with this translation is that we are inclined to understand virtue in a moral sense which is not always what the ancients had in mind. For the Greeks pertains to all sorts of qualities we would not regard as relevant to of a woman and the high speed of a . So it is important to bear in mind that the sense of virtue operative in ancient ethics is not exclusively moral and includes more than moral states such as the contemporary conception is not as teleological as Aristotelian ethics. According to Aristotle virtuous activity is to achieve well-being or happiness and for that purpose we have to have our virtue in the sense of rationality is peculiar to human beings of a human being will involve the exercise of his rational capacities to the highest degree to attain well-being. The contemporary account contemporary virtue theory seems to take account of the fact that what counts as a virtue is influenced by it does not necessarily agree with Aristotle's list of the virtues. A particularly conspicuous example of this is (""greatness of soul"") Aristotle regards as a virtue. Contemporary theory would not accept it as a virtue. Another example is the virtue of kindness which Aristotle does not have on his list of virtues but which contemporary virtue theory accepts from the Christian tradition. contemporary theory is more hesitant about ' doctrine of the unity of the virtues than Aristotle. Of course Aristotle diverges from Socrates in that he recognizes the real difference of the virtues; but he at least endorses the Socratic idea that one cannot have one virtue without having them all based on the intellectual virtue of practical wisdom ( ) he emphasizes. Aristotle thus maintains that one cannot properly possess any of the virtues unless one has developed practical wisdom. Conversely if one has practical wisdom then one has all the virtues. Most contemporary thinkers will not recognize the strong sort of dependency between practical wisdom and courage Virtues have been talked about and encouraged to be practiced in almost all places and although they may have been treated in a variety of ways because of the diversity of cultures and places. Virtues have not been seen as something accidental but rather something purposeful. Major world have derived human virtues from some ultimate existence that provides a purpose. Indian religions such as which in case of Hinduism is apparently the projection of divine order from . Chinese religions find virtues to be originated ultimately from and Christianity see human virtues as coming from . All religions seem to teach that practicing virtues leads to liberation or salvation. virtues are character states of the in its harmony and are related to which is derived from eternal which is a revival of this Greek virtue ethics after its interruption by is basically in agreement with this point. Various virtues developed in ordinary human life and community such as the Roman virtues the virtues of martial arts and the virtues listed by also tend to point to something meaningful. This kind of universal assessment of virtues which says that they can be attributed to something ultimate is unacceptable to critics such as the nihilist rejecting conventional universal standards for virtues believe that virtues should be invented by humans themselves. But Alasdair MacIntyre in his highly regarded book refutes this Nietzchean criticism among others.

1620763605.871967,14034601,https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Korean_literature,"Hunmin Jeongeum (lit. The Correct/Proper Sounds for the Instruction of the People) is the body of literature produced in or by Korean writers. For much of history it was written both in classical Chinese and in Korean first using the transcription systems idu and gugyeol and finally using the Korean script hangul. It is commonly divided into classical and modern periods although this distinction is sometimes unclear. The development of Korean Literature is quite unique due to the creation of a complete new language and writing system by the great the hangul. Sejong wanted that everyone could have access to culture but by that time Chinese characters were essential in philosophy and literature. Therefore hangul remained neglected by the literati and were considered useful only for women and for low class people. A tension always existed between those preferring hanmun and those trying to give its value to the Korean language. In consequence a debate arose on what should be considered as truly Korean Literature. Under the Japanese occupation from 1910 to 1945 some Korean scholars aimed at recovering what was purely Korean in language and literature. They hoped to remove what was foreign. After the liberation others tried to focus on what was the true spirit of Koreans without excluding the works written in Chinese characters. Today there is a common agreement to accept both types of works in and in hangul as part of the Korean literature heritage. Furthermore interesting researches are done on the traditional oral literature of the early period since Korean literature was first orally transmitted and sometimes written much later either in mixed form particularly in its form of short novels is much more appreciated today and translated into foreign languages the classical part is substantial and of great value. Like in other world literature poetry was one of the first literary forms. Koreans always loved to sing and dance and the first poems were sung. Other literary Gentry like historical and autobiographical appeared around the thirteenth century but the novel genre took slowly shape only around the fifteenth century. The Confucian atmosphere long predominated either in poetry or the beginning of novels but scholars played a role in infusing new ideas through satirical short stories opening people to modernity. Women also were very creative in poetry and autobiographic genres and made the feminine voice heard particularly from the beginning of the twentieth century. The role of women in literature during the Choson period The dimension of ""han"" 恨 in Korean literature Reflections on modern and contemporary literature The appreciation of Korean literature requires a balance in the exploration of classic autobiographies and novels. Some long novels although they are not known are of great value. Furthermore Koreans have excelled in certain genres like Sijo poetry and short novel that express more adequately their mind and emotion. Classical Korean literature has its roots in traditional folk beliefs and folk tales of the Korean peninsula. Other influences include was established at the same time as the Chinese script arrived on the peninsula. Korean scholars were writing poetry in the classical Chinese style as early as the fourth century. Some historians exclude these forms of literature from Korean literature arguing that they were merely forms of Chinese literature. that the fact that Chinese characters were used is not reason enough to exclude the literature from the classical Korean canon particularly since it reflects Korean thought and experience. Under a national academy was founded to promote Korean literature. For most of the era Korean upper educated classes were bilingual speaking Korean but writing in Classical Chinese like Japan The word hyangga means ""native songs "" from Korea in opposition to the Chinese songs.
Hyangga poetry was written in Korean using modified Chinese characters in a system that is called [idu]이두 吏讀 the variety of idu used to write hyangga was sometimes called ""hyangchal향찰 鄕札."" Under the Hyangchal system Chinese characters were given a Korean reading based on the syllable associated with the character. The Hyangchal writing system is often classified as a subgroup of Idu. Idu was a clever system whereby Koreans who spoke a language much different from Chinese to express Korean. The key to the system was to use some Chinese characters for their intended purpose and others for their pronunciation ignoring their pictographic meaning. On the surface it appears to be a complicated but after using the system one become comfortable with certain characters consistently standing for Korean words Such texts were deciphered only in the first half of the twentieth century. The deciphering of the hyangga is comparable to an archaeological work. Hyangga was the first uniquely Korean form of poetry. Only twenty five survive. The 三國遺事 Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms by the monk Iryon (1206-1289) contains fourteen poems and the ""Gyunyeojeon "" a set of biographies of prominent monks contains eleven poems. Both these classic works were written much after the Silla dynasty yet the record appears to be based on no-longer-extant records actually from the Hyangga are characterized by a number of formal rules. The poems may consist of four eight or ten lines. The ten-line poems are the most developed structured into three sections with four and two lines respectively. Many of the ten-line poems were written by Buddhist monks. And Buddhist themes predominate the poems. If most of the hyangga are they contain also a broad range of themes which are reflected in a variety of poems such as folk songs elegies to heroic hwarang knights Shaman exorcism or Buddhist prayer-poem. Many of the poems are elegies to monks and to family members. The especially before unification (668) was a time of warfare and the hyangga capture the sorrow of mourning for the dead while provided answers about where the dead go and the afterlife. A typical hyangga is the Ode for Life Eternal the Ode for Nirvana. The poem is a song that calls upon the moon to convey the supplicant's prayer to the Western paradise the home of Amita (or Amitabha—the of the Western paradise). The poem's authorship is somewhat unclear; it was either written by a monk or As you go to the west this night go before the eternal Buddha And tell him that there is one here Who adores Him of the deep oaths And chants daily with hands together can any of the 48 vows be kept While still trapped in this mortal frame? tone like this poem describing the unflinching and noble spirit of the hwarang. The moon that pushes her way Knight Kip’a once stood by the water Reflecting his face in the Iro Henceforth I shall seek and gather The depth of his mind among pebbles. you are the towering pine are called long poems in contrast with the later period Sijo that included only three lines. Only twenty one of these poems have been transmitted. Differently of the hyangga which often had a religious tone these changga anonymous were mostly secular songs expressing the life of ordinary people but their transmission has become complex due to the use by the court with some modifications. They were first transmitted orally and later on written down at the end of the fifteenth century and at the beginning of the sixteenth century. songs are considered as the oldest Korean songs. Experts have it that these songs which were transcribed into hangul giving not only the sense but also the sound. They give the impression that one hears the people of that time. The themes of these poems deal with simple life close to nature but they focus mainly on the theme of love which can be ordinary love the parting of someone or special forms of love like the mother's love. Though a hoe too is an edged blade It does not cut like a scythe. Though father too is a parent . There are two distinct forms: (연잔체). The former is a shorter form in which the entire poem was put into a single stanza whereas the latter is a more extended form in which the poem is put into several stanzas. The Goryeo songs are characterized by their lack of clear form and by their increased length. Most are direct in their nature and cover aspects of common life. Sijo and gasa are closely linked to the development of hangul in the early Joseon period. As hangul was created was developed as a way to note musical scores using the Korean script. himself is credited with a compilation of Buddhist songs. The word sijo is made of time and harmony. This form of poetry is also called tan-ga 短歌 by opposition to changga since it is short made only of three lines with a pause in the middle of each line. ) was common in the Joseon period. Although its poetic form was established in the late Goryeo period it did not become popular until the Joseon period. Many of the sijo reflected Confucian thought; the theme of loyalty is common but many other themes are dealt with: Regrets about aging sorrow over spurned love or loss of power and honor reaffirmation of loyalty to a lost cause. Sijo are characterized by a structure of three stanzas of four feet each. Each foot contains three to four syllables except on the third stanza where the 1st foot is supposed to have 3 syllables and the 2nd foot can have as many as seven. Sijo are thought to have been popular with common people. Among the sijo most cherished by the Koreans is this poem written by Chong Mong-ju who expressed his loyalty to the last king of Koryo and refused to serve the new dynasty created by General Yi Song-gye in 1392.
It movingly expressed the value of an unchanging heart. Were I to die a hundred times With all my bones no more than dust My soul gone far from men. Shall witness that my heart was true. although its content can include more than the expression of individual sentiment such as moral admonitions. Gasa is a simple form of verse with twinned feet of three or four syllables each. Some regard gasa a form of essay. Common themes in gasa were nature or love between man and woman. Besides poetry other genres were taking shape during the mostly during the age of the military under the dictatorship of the family Ch’oe. There are several activities related to different literary genres: 1. Historical writing: Kim Pu-sik (1075-1151) Samguk sagi 三國史記 with a view and later on Iryôn (1206-1289) a Buddhist monk Samguk yusa 三國遺事 . As previously mentioned part of the hyanggya were included in the 2. Biographical works like the Tongmunsôn 1518) with various texts such as memorials inscriptions and critical writings. Tongmunson 東文選 is an anthology with an encyclopedic dimension going back as far as Koguryo but mostly written during the Koryo period. Another text is the kongbangjôn 孔方傳 of Im Ch’un (1170). Chuk puinjôn 竹夫人傳 the story of Madame Bamboo of Yi Kok (1297-1351) speaks of objects or animals as if they were human beings. It was a way to criticize the king’s court and social problems. It makes us think of the fables of in Greece or La Fontaine in We are used to read all-made books of literature or well printed novels but the appearance of Korean novels and world literature novels are quite recent. They are the fruits of many attempts and gropes during history. Therefore the genre of Korean ""novel” slowly took shape. It is first spoken not of novel but of “romance.” Among the pioneers of this genre we find Kim Si-sup (1435-1493) with his Kûmho sinhwa among them the story of Student Yi peers over the Wall. People spoke too quickly about novel. The genre influenced by Chinese literature still remains at that tome within the atmosphere of with the dimension of fantastic reality and dreams. Like Rabelais (1494-1553) in Kim Si-sup was an eccentric monk and both were trying to bring new ideas into society. Both used the fantasy and imagines to awaken the mind of their contemporaries. Often Kim Si-sup counted tales of wonder and love affairs between mortals and ghosts and dream journeys to the underworld or to the dragon palace. A special place must be made for Hô Kyun (1559-1618) and the story of Hong Kilton. Although this short work is considered as the first real Korean novel it is closer to a “short story.” It is the fictive biography of the bastard of an aristocrat in the style of a Chinese story. The hero gathers around him rebels to correct social ills. As an illegitimate son he fights to be recognized and accepted as a legitimate member of the literati. The utopian place he built resembles the Confucian society. Hô Kyun lived at the time of The research in the direction of novel within the classical atmosphere is best illustrated by Kim Man-jung (1637-1692)'s story A Nine Cloud Dream 구운몽(九雲夢). This story of a young Buddhist novice dreaming in his cell of achieving the worldly life of a Confucian scholar and coming back to his cell as a monk to be chastised by his master because of his desires was very popular. It was popular for the many adventures amorous encounters but also for its poetry. It carried two contradictory dreams that usually people have one for wordless success and the other for a withdrawal from the world to find serenity and peace. Kim Man-jung relies in fact on the three spiritualities of "" as its name indicates was all about dreams it did not present fable characters true concrete situations to which the reader can rely. The hero has already achieved at 16 years of age scholarship family… the story is not related neither to T’ang China or to the seventeenth century . It is just a blend of romance and fairy tale as it was described. As a consequence this story does not qualify yet as a modern novel. The role of women in literature during the Choson period Women unfortunately were discouraged to get educated like men families. The worst situation was for women belonging to the working classes because they had to assume the hard tasks in the fields and at home even weaving. The condition of yangban wives was better materially but they were forced to stay home to serve unconditionally their in-laws and were not allowed to write and certainly not to publish. Despite this condition imposed under rigid principles that would require discussion not a few women during the Choson dynasty have proven a strength of independent character of revendication and of of literary creativity which draw admiration today. Some of those women remain as a model like Lady Yun mother of Kim Man-jung (seventeenth century) and Lady Shin Saimdang (sixteenth century). Yulgok's mother is not just remembered as an excellent educator of her son but as a creative woman in delicate painting and moral direction. Two other women are recently rediscovered for her talents in writing and the expression of Korean emotions Ho Nansorhon (1562-1590) and Lady Hyegyong (1735-1805). Ho Nansorhon was a very talented young woman who suffered to be constantly left alone by her yangban husband. Often in despair she poured out her sorrows and dreams in her poetry. Every Korean remember the beginning of her 50 lines kasa: The day before yesterday I was young But today I am already aging. the joyful days of my youth. Although she lost her two children she was able to share the pains of other suffering people surrounding her. She weaves through the night without rest. The rattling of the loom sounds lonesome. This roll of silk in the loom Whose dress will it make when it is finished? Her hand clasps the metal scissors. The chill of the night stiffens all her fingers. For others she has made bridal clothes Year after year alone in her room. Lady Hyegyong (1735-1815) is now known worldwide for her Records made in distress 恨中錄. Born in a family she was chosen at a young age as a princess the future wife of prince Sado son of king Yongjo (1724-1776). The relation between prince Sado and his father deteriorated and was embittered by the intrigues of rival political factions. Pushed by anger Yongjo ordered his son put into a rice chest. Sado died in this horrible condition after a few days. Traumatized by the event Lady Hyegyong tried to commit suicide then worked at protecting her son's life the future great king Chongjo. First she buried these memories deep in her soul until the day she decided to write about it. In this way started to take shape her famous memoirs. Lady Hyegyong wrote her memoirs four times starting with the happy memories of her childhood in her family the difficult separation to enter the palace and the good moments near the royal family. It was so far a writing of personal matter. Only in 1805 was she able to face the horror of the past and to tell the truth that the king's son had been really murdered. Nobody was allowed to express views on historical matters outside the official records. Those records did not mention any murder of prince Sado. The memoirs of Lady Hyegyong take a a great significance in going over the individual level and daring to point out to a great injustice. In doing so Lady Hyegyong was opening a way of truth which can be still meditated today and was showing the power of literature. movement is well known for his contributions in politics economy and philosophy at a time of encounter with new ideas coming from the West as early as the seventeenth century but which were in full swing from the middle of the eighteenth to the middle of the nineteenth century. See articles on Sirhak Song-ho Yi Ik and Jeong Yak-young it is less known that prominent members of the Sirak had real talents in literature and particularly contributed with their satirical stories. These authors used their pen with humor to attract the attention of the readers amusing them by caricaturing people of society particularly the yangban but in fact depicting the situation of a sick society and insulating ideas of reform. One of the most popular Sirak writer was Yonam Park Chi-won (1737-1805) known for his Jehol Diary giving account of his travel in . Park Chi-won wrote a series of powerful short novels such as The Life of Mrs Park of Hamyang Moving into the nineteenth century and beginning of the twentieth century we enter a period of trouble in Korea with the severe persecution against and Western ideas in 1801 which repeated itself several times until the last part of the century. The (1864-1871) was opposed to any opening of the West and was known ass the hermit kingdom. Is only at the end pf the nineteenth century that Korea signed treaties with Western nations and thought seriously about modernization. A lot of debates were taking place among the intellectuals as to open or not to the West. Yi Hang-no (1792-1868) was for a continuation of traditional Confucianism considered higher morally against the Western science and religion considered as barbarians whence his motto repelling the barbarians and praising the Chinese wijong ch'oksa. Modern Korean literature developed against the background of the 's fall. This first period of modern Korean literature is often called (Enlightenment). This period was to a large extent influenced by the 1894 Gabo Reforms which introduced Western-style schools and or even serial novels and led to the emergence of professional writers. and contributed to the formation of modern free verse poetry . Sinchesi abandoned the fixed meter found in classical Korean poetry influenced by the French verse libre. Ch'oe Nam-son (1890-1957) played an important role with a literary magazine called Ch'oe inaugurates the new poetry movement by his From the sea to children 1908 inspired by Byron. Many biographical works were published in the late Joseon period where the main character was often depicted as a hero. These works cultivated The dimension of ""han"" 恨 in Korean literature The concept of han 恨 which appears in the title mentioned of Lady Hyegyong's memoirs has been emphasized a lot by Koreans. Han was expressed in various ways through poems autobiographies and novels but is not easy to define. Important researches are done today to precise this concept like Lee Younghee's Ideology culture and han: traditional and early modern Korean women's literature. Han is a difficult term to translate into English… For example it has been seen as resentment hatred and regret… All writers conclude that han is a sentiment that can be transcended defining han as a willingness to overcome difficulties and not to give in when faced with an unhappy situation. has both negative and positive aspects. Analyses have it that the accumulation of rejections despises and refusals under the rigid ruling of Neo-Confucian society have caused individuals to build up inside huge resentments. At the same time people looked for easing and defusing these resentments. Shamanist rituals of kuts and later on Christian beliefs played an important role in this positive undoing. Han has been expressed through poems called 내방가사(內房歌詞) like this young woman dreaming to visit her parents what she was not allowed to do by her in-laws. I would fly in the sky with grand movements of wings. I would pay a visit to my hometown to see my parents. It is no better than that of a no account beast. Kim Myeong-sun 김명순 (金明淳 1896∼?) is supposed to have written in 1917 one of the first novels The Suspicious girl 의심의 소녀 that confronts directly the social problems of Korea. There are no dream and happy ending but a description of bland facts. The story portrays a young mother who kills herself because of the injustices of the concubinage system. Kim Myeong-sun is among the first women to refuse to blame herself or summit obediently to unjust rules like concubinage and to denounce the responsibility of men who freely abuse younger women when they impose chastity to their wives at the cost of sacrifice. Her novel makes heard Korean women’s voice. she received none; she yearned for freedom but in vain. She even requested a separation but he would not grant her wish. And so she continued to suffer his suspicions and abuse. Thus imprisoned her despair had deepened…. On a blossoming April day when even tiny nameless pieces of grass trampled by horses hoofs seemed to awaken she ended with a dagger what would have been the flowering of her young twenty-four years. Reflections on modern and contemporary literature With the modern and contemporary periods Korean literature went a complex path due to its East Asian heritage and his encounter with the West. Attempts have been done in various ways to adapt to the West or imitate it or to create in a specifically Korean manner. Debates are still going on. It was the heritage of both the evolutions of Silhak and Tonghak that three sources of Korean culture—the Northeast Asian heritage the substructure of the native tradition and the knowledge given by Western impact intermingled with each other and transformed themselves into a firm base for Korean modern humanities. During the Japanese rule of Korea (1910–1945) speech and the press were restricted affecting the Korean literature of the time. Many expressions of the late Joseon period with their focus on self-reliance and independence were no longer possible. With the Samil Movement in 1919 a new form of Korean literature was established. Many writers exhibited a more positive attitude trying to cope with the national situation at the time. Literature focused on self-discovery and increasingly on concrete reality. Artistic endeavors were supported by national newspapers. Many novels of the 1920s centered around the themes of the suffering of intellectuals who drift through reality. The lives of farmers were often depicted as pathetic. As the Japanese government strengthened Korean literature was directly affected. Many novels of the time experimented with new literary styles and techniques. Under the Japanese occupation Koreans had to imitate Japanese adaptation of Western civilization. But despite this situation many Korean scholars achieved a lot in history combining what was Korean and Western. Yi In-jik (1862-1916) is considered as the one of the father of modern novel and a precursor of modern theater. He is specially remembered for his Tears of blood Hyoruinunmul of 1906. Two other important writers are Yi Kwang-su (1892-1945) with his Mujong The heartless and Kim Tong-in (1900-1951) with his historical novels. In the 1920's a literary naturalist trend is launched by writers like Yom Sang-op (1897-1963) and Yi Sang (1910-1937). Han Yong-un (1879-1944) and Kim So-wol (190201934) are the poets depicting the during that period the plight of colonization. Maturity was reached in poetry in the 1930's with Chong Chi-won (b.1903) there was a good start of genuine Korean studies but it was lost again with the Korean War. After the War academic researches were much influenced by the U.S. There has been a continuing argument that even in Korean humanities general theories of a non-empirical scientific background had to be imported from the West. Modernization meant Westernization. After the liberation from Japan in 1945 Korea soon found itself divided into led to the development of literature centered around the wounds and chaos of . Much of the post-war literature in South Korea deals with the daily lives of ordinary people and their struggles with national pain. The collapse of the traditional Korean value system is another common theme of the time. In the post-war period a traditionalist movement emerged: going back to the roots of traditional rhythms and folk sentiments. Other poets are linked to an experimentalist movement attempting to bring new experiences to Korean poetry. In the 1960s many writers started to reject post-war literature as sentimental escapism. While some Korean authors reflected traditional humanism writings by many others reflect deep alienation and despair. They sought to engage the readers with the political reality of the time. This led poetry and literature in general to become an important means of political expression. Also remarkable for the development of literature in 1960s was the influence of Western modernism. The 1970s saw the emergence of literature that was anti-establishment and dealt with the concerns of rapid industrialization such as the neglect of farmers. At the same time literature concerned with the national division became more popular. At the beginning of the twenty-first century the national division is still a common theme but classic stories are also popular. Some North Korean writers are very highly appreciated in the South and in 2005 writers from both Koreas held a joint literary congress. Korean literature was largely unknown outside of the peninsula. The kind of works translated has become increasingly diverse and the quality of the translations has improved. was one of the first anthologies of Korean literature published in English. In non-English-speaking countries there are fewer Korean works translated. The increased popularity of Korean film has increased interest in Korean literature.

1620763636.350502,65521019,https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Book_of_Mormon,"Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints of the Latter Day Saint movement. It is regarded by most Latter Day Saint groups as divinely revealed and is named after the prophet compiled most of the book. It was published by the founder of the LDS movement in March 1830 in Palmyra Origin of the Book of Mormon Role within the Community of Christ Church the Book of Mormon is esteemed as part of the canon of sacred scripture by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and other churches that claim Joseph Smith as their founder. In 1982 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints added the subtitle to its editions of the book to help clarify and emphasize its purpose. Origin of the Book of Mormon the book is a translation of gold plates which contained the writings of in ancient Meso-America between approximately 600 The plates were said to be buried by Moroni the last of these prophets at a hill called Cumorah. published the first edition of the Book of Mormon in 1830 in Palmyra Smith claimed that on September 22 1827 he received the plates from an named Moroni and was directed to translate them using two stones called the Urim and Thummim that were deposited with the plates. In addition to Smith's account eleven others signed affidavits that they had seen the gold plates for themselves. Their written testimonies are known as The Testimony of Three Witnesses and The Testimony of Eight Witnesses. These affidavits are published as part of the introductory pages to the claim that the book was either the original creation of Joseph Smith (with or without the assistance of one or more of his associates) or was based on a prior work such as Unresolved issues of the book's historicity and the lack of supporting archaeological evidence have led some adherents to adopt the position that the Book of Mormon may have been the creation of Joseph Smith but that it was nevertheless divinely inspired. as stated on its title page is ""to show the remnant of the House of Israel what great things the Lord has done for their fathers"" and to convince ""Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ manifesting himself to all nations."" The format of the Book of Mormon is a compilation of smaller ""books."" Each of the books is named after the prophet or leader noted in the text as the author. The Book of Mormon is composed of the following books: First Book of Nephi: His Reign and Ministry Book of Jacob: The Brother of Nephi Book of Alma: The Son of Alma Third Nephi: The Book of Nephi Who Was the Son of Helaman Fourth Nephi: The Book of Nephi Who Is the Son of Nephi One of the Disciples of Jesus Christ The book's sequence is primarily chronological based on the narrative content of the book. Exceptions include the Words of Mormon and the Book of Ether. The Words of Mormon contains editorial comment by Mormon. The Book of Ether is presented as the narrative of an earlier group of people to have come to America before the immigration described in First Nephi. The books of First Nephi through Omni are written in first-person narrative as are Mormon and Moroni. The remainder of the is written in third-person historical narrative compiled and abridged by Mormon (with Moroni abridging the Book of Ether). The version published by the LDS Church is known as The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ. In addition to the main body of the work A modern day introduction written by church leaders "" the ""Testimony of Eight Witnesses "" and the ""Testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith"" (as it concerns the Book of Mormon) A brief explanation of the contents of the book A pronouncing guide to names and places in the Book of Mormon Footnotes and cross-references to the Bible The books from 1 Nephi to Omni are described as being from ""the small plates of Nephi."" This account begins in ancient at roughly the same time as the in the Bible. It tells the story of Lehi and several others as they are led by from Jerusalem shortly before the fall of that city to the and then to the promised land (the Americas) by ship. These books recount the group's dealings from approximately 600 the community split into two main groups the Nephites and the Lamanites and grew into separate sizable civilizations which warred against each other. said to be written in 385 is a short introduction to the books of Mosiah and 4 Nephi. These books are described as being abridged from a large quantity of existing records called ""the large plates of Nephi"" that detailed the nation's history from the time of Omni to Mormon's own life. The book of 3 Nephi is of particular importance within the because it contains an account of a visit by from heaven to the Americas sometime after his and ascension. During his American ministry he repeated much of the same doctrine and instruction given in the of the Bible and established an enlightened peaceful society which endured for several generations but which eventually broke into warring factions again. is an account of the events during Mormon's life. Mormon received the charge of taking care of the records that had been hidden once he was old enough. Mormon writes an account of the wars his leading of portions of the Nephite army and his retrieving and caring for the records. Mormon eventually is killed after he hands down the records to his son Moroni. Moroni then makes an abridgment (called Ether) of a record from a previous people called the Jaredites. The account describes a group of families led from the headed by a man named Jared and his brother. The Jaredite civilization is presented as existing on the American continent long before Lehi's family arrived in 600 and it was much larger and more developed. The book of Moroni then details the final destruction of the Nephites and the state of the remaining society. He adds a few spiritual insights and mentions some important doctrinal teachings then closes with his testimony and an invitation to to God for a confirmation of the truthfulness of the account. The central event of the Book of Mormon is the visitation of the Jesus to the Nephites around 34 shortly after his ministry in Galilee (3 Nephi 11 to 3 Nephi 26). Many of the writers in the book teach about . There are 239 chapters in the Book of Mormon and 233 include Jesus Christ in some way. An angel prophesied to Nephi that Jesus' birth would be 600 years from the time he and his family left 1 Nephi 19:8; also 3 Nephi 1). Many beginning with Lehi and Nephi saw in visions the birth and death of Jesus (1 Nephi 11) and were told his name (Mosiah 3:8). At the time of King Benjamin the Nephite believers were called ""the children of Christ"" (Mosiah 5:7). The faithful members of the church at the time of Captain Moroni (73 ) were called ""Christians"" by their enemies because of their belief in Jesus Christ (Alma 46:13-15). For nearly 200 years after Jesus' appearance at the temple in the Americas (4 Nephi 22-23) the land was filled with peace and prosperity because of the people's obedience to his commandments (4 Nephi 1). Mormon worked to convince the faithless people of his time (360 ) of Christ. Moroni buried the Many other prophets in the book also wrote of the reality of the Church members officially regard the Book of Mormon as the ""most correct"" book of scripture. Joseph Smith told of receiving a revelation condemning the ""whole church"" for treating the Book of Mormon and the former commandments lightly —""former commandments"" being understood to mean the Holy Bible. The importance of studying the Book of Mormon in addition to the Bible has been stressed by every church president since Joseph Smith. ’s significance was reiterated in the late twentieth century by Ezra Taft Benson Apostle and 13th President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints then LDS President Gordon B. Hinckley challenged each member of the church to reread the Book of Mormon before year's end. The book’s importance is commonly stressed at the twice-yearly general conference and at special devotionals by general authorities. Role within the Community of Christ Church The Community of Christ views the Book of Mormon as an additional witness of Jesus Christ and publishes two versions of the book through its official publishing arm Herald House. The Authorized Edition is based on the original printer's manuscript and the 1837 Second Edition (or Kirtland Edition) of the Book of Mormon. Its content is similar to the Book of Mormon published by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints but the versification is different. Community of Christ also publishes a 1966 ""Revised Authorized Edition "" which attempts to modernize some of the language. Community of Christ President W. Grant McMurray reflected on increasing questions about the Book of Mormon: ""The proper use of the Book of Mormon as sacred scripture has been under wide discussion in the 1970s and beyond in part because of long-standing questions about its historicity and in part because of perceived theological inadequacies including matters of race and ethnicity."" At the 2007 Community of Christ World Conference President Stephen M. Veazey ruled out of order a resolution to ""reaffirm the Book of Mormon as a divinely inspired record."" He stated that ""while the Church affirms the Book of Mormon as scripture and makes it available for study and use in various languages we do not attempt to mandate the degree of belief or use. This position is in keeping with our longstanding tradition that belief in the Book of Mormon is not to be used as a test of fellowship or membership in the church."" challenge the historicity of the text and raise several major issues that undermine the text's authority: Few scholars identify any correlation between locations described in the and any Mesoamerican or other American plants and technologies named in the did not exist in the Americas before the arrival of Europeans at the end of the fifteenth century. There is no linguistic connection between any language or language family and any Near Eastern language or language family. Mayan writing has no relationship to any Near Eastern writing system. records from the time period identified in the Book of Mormon make no mention of people or places named in the evidence shows no Near Eastern component in the Native American genetic makeup. The Book of Mormon is now published by the following: Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ The Book of Mormon - Revised Authorized Version The Book of Mormon - Authorized Version The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite) as The Book of Mormon: An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates taken from the Plates of Nephi —an original edition compiled by a committee made up of Church of Jesus Christ apostles: Thurman S. Furnier Charles Ashton and William H. Cadman Wisconsin for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite); a photo-enlarged facsimile of the 1840 edition The Book of Mormon - Restored Covenant Edition The University of Illinois Press as The Book of Mormon: A Reader's Edition (2003) (this edition is based on the 1920 LDS edition) The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ Herald Heritage (Herald House) (1970) - a facsimile of the 1830 edition. Church critics claim that the original versions of the Book of Mormon contained substantial evidence that Joseph Smith fabricated the Book of Mormon and that the church has revised the The Tanners have documented almost 4 between the 1830 edition and modern editions. These revisions include wording changes such as ""King Benjamin"" to ""King Mosiah"" (Mosiah 21:28) adding the phrase ""or out of the waters of baptism and correction of spelling and grammatical errors. The contention is that many of the changes were systematic and are signs of fabrication. Supporters of the Book of Mormon maintain that correctness refers only to the content notably the doctrine. Since Joseph Smith later made corrections to the text of the Book of Mormon on both copies of the manuscript (the original and the copy prepared for the printer) and in later editions he did not consider the book to be an infallible translation as it first appeared in print. The Book of Mormon itself indicates that it may contain errors made by the men who wrote it (Title Page; 1 Nephi 19:6; Jacob 1:2; 7:26; Mormon 8:1 17; 9:31-33; 3 Nephi 8:2; Ether 5:1). The vast majority of the changes noted by the Tanners have been discussed in official Church publications including the and are consistent with early pre- and post-publication edits made by Joseph Smith. Some corrections were made due to earlier print or copy errors the LDS Church's Brigham Young University has been publishing a critical text edition of the contain transcriptions of all the text variants of the English editions of the Book of Mormon from the original manuscript up to the newest editions. Volume 3 describes the history of all the English-language texts from Joseph Smith to today. Volume 4 published in parts from 2004-2006 contains a critical analysis of all the text variants. has been translated into 80 languages. Selections of the have been translated into an additional 27 languages. In 2001 the LDS church reported that all or part of the text was available in the native language of 99 percent of Latter-day Saints and 87 percent of the world's total population. Translations into languages without a tradition of writing (such as Cakchiqel Tzotzil) are available on audio cassette. Translations into American Sign Language are available on videocassette and DVD. translators are members of the LDS Church who are employed by the church and translate the text from the original English. Each manuscript is reviewed many times before it is approved and published. the LDS Church stopped translating selections from the Book of Mormon. The church announced that each new translation it approves will be a full edition.

World History Encyclopedia was founded in 2009 by Jan van der Crabben. He realized that the internet was missing a reliable and comprehensive resource for ancient history which is why the website was called Ancient History Encyclopedia until it changed its name to World History Encyclopedia in 2021. What was available online was either scattered across various websites illegible due to poor presentations or tainted with a distinct nationalist agenda. Jan also had the idea that history was not linear (as it is taught in most school coursebooks) but rather a very parallel type of story where everything is interlinked. After much programming on a netbook during daily train rides from London to Horsham in the United Kingdom the site was launched to the public in August 2009. Since then it has grown from a small history website to the largest and most popular history encyclopedia on the internet.

1620763668.564788,92019254,https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/History_of_North_Korea,"formally begins with the establishment of In the aftermath of the Japanese occupation of Korea which ended with divided Korea at the 38th parallel responsibility to administer the north of the 38th parallel and the to the south. The Soviet Union] refused to follow the UN mandate for democratic elections nation wide leading the United Nations to declare the democratically elected government of as the sole legitimate government of the . That led to a divided nation in 1948 dictatorship in the north rejecting the United Nations proclamation and claiming sole right to rule Korea. began to prepare his plan of attack on the south from that time. The split of Korea into north and south has precedent in . The northern regions of the and the Sea of Japan (known as ""Korean East Sea"" in North Korea and ""East Sea"" in South Korea) times been within the Korean borders. The distinction in Korea between the northern and southern cultures. Even though Korea is considered 100 percent homogeneous the case has been made that Koreans in the southern part of the peninsula originated in indigenous and northern part of the Korean Peninsula originated from 's Soviet-backed communist dictatorship declared the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on September 9 1948. The communist government claimed sole legitimacy to rule the entire as its capital. The DPRK controlled the Soviet-occupied northern parts of Korea with Pyongyang as the capital. Since the entry of Soviet forces in 1945 a provisional government structure had been imposed in the occupation zone with at its helm. Kim became the prime minister of the DPRK. The Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland with the communist Workers Party of North Korea as its leading force although supported by the Soviets possessed only partial political control at the time. Within his own party (the Workers Party) four separate factions existed his own 'guerrilla' faction standing as the smallest. Kim Tu-bong held the party chairmanship while Kim Il-sung shared the vice chairmanship with Chu Nyong-ha. The three men belonged to different fractions. Moreover non-communist political forces held significant sway in North Korea at the time. Two non-communist parties the Democratic Party and the Chondoist Chongu Party belonged to the Democratic Front and had a mass following of their own. Kim Il-sung gradually strengthened his control over the state and party affairs eliminating fractional enemies within the party and neutralized the non-communist parties. On June 30 the Workers Party of North Korea merged with the Workers Party of South Korea (whose leadership had shifted to Pyongyang after a crackdown on their illegal activities in the south) forming the Workers Party of Korea. became the chairman of the unified party whereas veteran Korean communist leader Pak Hon-yong (the leader of WPSK) became the vice chairman. Kim's government moved rapidly to establish a political system styled on the Soviet system with political power monopolized by the WPK. The establishment of a command economy followed. Most of the country's productive assets had been owned by the Japanese or by Koreans who had been collaborators. The nationalization of those assets in 1946 placed 70 percent of industry under state control. By 1949 that percentage had risen to 90 percent. Since then finance and internal and external trade has been conducted by the state. the government moved more slowly towards a command economy. The ""land to the tiller"" reform of 1946 redistributed the bulk of agricultural land to the poor and landless peasant population effectively breaking the power of the landed class. In 1954 the dictatorship commanded a partial collectivization with peasants being urged into agricultural co-operatives. By 1958 collectives conducted virtually all farming and the co-operatives increasingly merged into larger productive units. Like all the postwar communist states North Korea undertook massive state investment in heavy industry state infrastructure and military buildup neglecting the production of consumer goods. By paying the collectivized peasants low state-controlled prices for their products and using the surplus thus extracted to pay for industrial development the state carried out a series of three-year plans bringing industry's share of the economy from 47 percent in 1946 to 70 percent in 1959 despite the devastation of the . Huge increases in expenditures for electricity production steel production and machine building resulted. The government focused on producing tractors and other agricultural machinery in large numbers with little increase in agricultural production. North Korea's economy still depended largely on aide from the Soviet Union and China the its standard of living lagging dramatically behind South Korea. As a result of those dictatorial changes the population suffered malnutrition and food shortages while the state controlled press painted a rosy picture. Any one contradicting the state line that North Korean agriculture surpassed South Korea's and that the North Korean standard of living surpassed South Koreans dramatically received a night time visit from the Kim Il-sung's secrete police force often never heard from again. Standards of living suffocated by the collectivization of farms rapidly decreased in North Korea in the later 1950s and into the 1960s. Only Kim's tight dictatorial control of the police and media kept the North Korean farmer from rebelling in a classic Peasant Revolt. Consumer goods always in chronic shortage from the state-controlled mandate for production rather than consumer-driven production as in the South led to serious discontent. Still few dared protest or even voice their discontent for fear of arrest and death in a work camp. In the cities a life of severe forced labor and constant demands for greater productivity plagued the workers. Kim's worker's paradise apart from the state controlled propaganda to the contrary resembled more a worker's hell. fire their weapon at Chinese Communist position on Hill 200 's government in the South by United Nations mandate and receiving the full support of the United States government led to the establishment of a fledgling democracy. A communist instigated insurrection in October 1948 successfully controlled by joint South Korean police and United States military action led Kim Il-sung to abandon hope of gaining control over South Korea by revolution from within. From early 1949 Kim sought Soviet and support for a military campaign to reunify the country by force. The withdrawal of most U.S. forces from South Korea in June 1949 left the southern government defended only by a weak and inexperienced South Korean army that served as a police force. The South Korean government also had to deal with a citizenry of uncertain loyalty. The North Korean army had been the beneficiary of the and had a core of hardened veterans who had fought as anti-Japanese guerrillas or with the Chinese Communists. but in late 1949 the victory of the Communists in China and development of the Soviet nuclear weapons made him re-consider Kim's proposal. In January 1950 Stalin finally gave permission to stage an invasion. The Soviet provided limited support in the form of advisors who helped the North Koreans as they planned the operation and Soviet instructors trained some of the Korean units. From the very beginning Stalin made it clear that the Soviet Union would avoid a direct confrontation with the U.S. over Korea and would not commit ground forces even in case of some major military crisis. Kim and Stalin set the stage for a civil war between two rival regimes on the Korean peninsula. Hungnam is blown up as USS For over a year before North Korean forces attacked the southern government on June 25 the two sides had been engaged in a series of bloody clashes along the 38th parallel especially in the Ongjin area on the west coast. On June 25 1950 the northern forces escalated the battles into a full-fledged offensive crossed the parallel enforce with an invasion plan. Due to a combination of surprise and a poorly armed South Korean army the Northern forces quickly captured forcing Syngman Rhee and his government to flee further south. The North Korean attacks falter due to decisive action by the United Nations and the United States forces stationed in Japan. Due to a Soviet boycott of the United Nations Security Council over a rejection of China's application for membership a unanimous vote put the United Nations into the first test of collective security. In two days after declaration of war against the North Korean invaders units from United States forces arrived in Korea and stationed directly in the path of the invading North Korean forces. Virtually a suicide mission the action led North Korea to halt and regroup long enough for United Nations forces to arrive in mass. Gen. Douglas MacArthur led a bold attack behind North Korean lines in Incheon driving North Korean forces in retreat. By October the U.N. forces had retaken Seoul and captured Pyongyang and it became Kim's turn to flee. But in November Chinese forces entered the war and pushed the U.N. forces back retaking Pyongyang in December and in January 1951. In March U.N. forces retook Seoul and the war essentially became a bloody stalemate for the next two years. The front stabilized in 1953 along what eventually became the current Armistice Line. After long negotiations the two sides agreed on a border formed by the and a truce was declared. Note that the warring nations never signed an official peace treaty leaving the two Koreas technically at war since 1950. Kim tightened control of North Korean politics with the support of the armed forces whom he made sure they received pay and benefits. Pak Hon-yong party vice chairman and Foreign Minister of DPRK received blamed for the failure of the southern population to support North Korea during the war suffered execution after a show-trial in 1955. Most of the South Korean leftists who defected to the North in 1945–1953 also received charges of espionage or other crimes against the state imprisoned or exiled to remote agricultural and mining villages. Kim continued to purge his rivals such as Kim Tu-bong clearing the way to absolute power and the creation of a god-like status enforced by secrete police. The 1954–1956 three-year plan proclaimed the goal of repairing the massive damage caused by the war bringing industrial production back to prewar dismal levels. Kim followed that with a five-year plan of 1957–1961 and the seven-year plan of 1961–1967. Those plans brought failed to bring growth in industrial production and substantial development of state infrastructure. By the 1960s North Korea's state controlled organs proclaimed the North Korea had become the second most industrialized nation in East Asia trailing only Japan. In fact Kim's war adventures and total state control of the economy had put North Korean on the brink of economic ruin. Only massive aid by Russia and China for ideological reasons kept North Korea for collapse. All the while Kim used his police force to increase his image as a god and to demand worship by the people of North Korea or suffer imprisonment and death. North Korea's economy followed the Soviet Union's pattern. Instead of letting the market place determine what factories produced the state mandated production quotas without consulting the real needs of consumers. As a result goods that consumers did not want languished on shelves while goods in high demand had long waiting lists. North Korea's living standards fell below most third world countries while the state controlled press painted a picture of economic prosperity. Visitors to North Korea received state appointed guides; they traveled arranged routes and could never set out on their own. Any North Korean citizen who spoke with an international visitor without permission suffered imprisonment or death. The North Korea press presented North Korea as an alternative to the capitalist model of development sponsored by the . The state-controlled press announced that by the late 1960s North Korea provided all its people with medical care and livable housing. In fact North Korea had the highest spending on military forces per capital in relationship to GNP while the population lived in poverty. a slogan he began to develop in the late 1950s ultimately proclaiming that North Korea's official ideology . Juche advanced the goal of self-reliance through military force enabling North Korea to advance communism throughout the Korean peninsula. Juche aimed to make North Korea self-sufficient. Ironically had an insatiable appetite for quality and luxury products from Japan and the West while the people of North Korea suffered without adequate food or housing. The dictatorship of the proletariat approved that practice as the communist ruling government served as a transition to the Worker's Paradise. Although the state-controlled press worked hard to secure the truth of the common person's life in North Korea the word of their real living circumstances came to South Korea the West and Japan through defectors. The philosophy of Juche served to support Kim Il-sung's communist dictatorship but did nothing to improve the life of common North Koreans. Kim used to urge the North Korean people to resist foreign invasion by launching a series of mass-campaigns designed to strengthen the country economically The Sino-Soviet split placed North Korea's communist dictatorship in jeopardy from 1960. Relations between North Korea and the Soviet Union worsened when the Soviets concluded that Kim Il-sung supported the Chinese side although Kim hoped to use the split to play China and the Soviets off against each other while pursuing a more independent policy. That resulted in a sharp decline in Soviet aid and credit which the Chinese lacked to wealth to compensate. Kim's enthusiasm for despite his rhetorical denunciations of ""revisionism."" While he supported Chinese campaigns such as the as destabilizing and dangerous. In that way Kim Il-sung showed his determination to mark an independent path for North Korea when possible. Due to the inherent contradictions in the massive expenditures on military without Chinese and Russia aide the failure of the collectivization program and the rejection of free enterprise North Korea suffered declining economic fortunes as have all communist dictatorships. North Korea's lack of foreign reserves and the prohibition many Western nations had placed on trade and investment in North Korea spiraled the country into economic depression. During that time Kim strengthened his grip on the country looking for every opportunity to overthrow the South Korean government. North Korea's economic condition became dire. Even the tight control by the state media had a hard time presenting a rosy picture of North Korean life the official line becoming one of ""slight economic reverse."" The Soviet Union's cutoff of subsidized oil dealt a staggering blow to North Korea. At the same time the price of oil on the international markets had reached an all time high combined with North Korea's depleted reserves of foreign currencies especially US dollars to create emergency conditions. The North Korean regime began to turn to weapon sales and counterfeiting United States dollars as ways of dealing with a shortage of US dollars. Still Kim continued to maintain one of the largest standing armies in the world. Kim Il-sung advanced the idea through his communist-controlled press that he needed to build up his military to establish independence from Chinese and Russian aid. In reality China and Russia increasingly cut North Korea off for military and economic aid and moving into the 1980s and 1990s the two governments increasing found Kim to be an embarrassment. His attempt to assassinate Park Chung-hee to build invasion tunnels under the DMZ and to provoke war with the United States and South Korea through incidents like the left both China and Russia unenthusiastic. Stalin's legacy had been denigrated in Russia and Kim ruled in the Stalinist fashion. Imjingang Railroad between North and South Korea using forced labor in the mines and borrowed capital to purchase equipment. Even if the international community had decided to buy Kim's minerals his plan fell apart with the collapse of the price of minerals. That failure he passed on to the people who already suffered famine and a lack of even basic necessities. Those lacks never affected Kim's military or the New Class of North Korean leadership. Kim still trumpeted the state line of the Worker's Paradise in North Korea. Kim's centrally planned economy emphasizing heavy industry required capital that the North Korean communist dictatorship lacked. Kim continued to push the failed philosophy of forcing them to create a self-sufficient nation without the resources to do so. By the mid to late-1970s North Korea could no longer hide the fact that South Korea had left North Korea far behind in developing advanced technology and a diversified economy. Kim Il-sung continued his ideology that he had successfully duped the world with even when the world press had caught wind of the true dire plight of North Korea's economy. Having failed at their earlier attempt to turn to the market and conduct market-economy reforms such as those carried out in China by Kim opted for continued ideological purity. The DPRK by 1980 faced the choice of either repaying its international loans or continuing its support for military buildup and lavish living by the New Class. Given Kim's commitment to hold power at all costs he decided to default on its loans while maintaining funding of the military. By the late 1980s with the collapse of the Berlin Wall the Soviet Union's and China's transformation from communist nations to capitalist Kim felt his world closing in. An official portrait of Kim Jong-il succeeded him as General-Secretary of the Korean Workers Party. Although Kim Il-sung left the post of President vacant Kim Jong-il became Chairman of the National Defense Commission a position described as the nation's ""highest administrative authority head of state. His succession had been decided in the late 1980s with the support of the most important interest group the armed forces led by Defense Minister Oh Jin-wu. During the decade of Kim Jong-il's rule North Korea's economy standard of living declined precipitously for its twenty-three million people. From 1996 to 1999 the country experienced a large-scale 000 people dead and a generation of children suffering from the long term effects of malnutrition. Yet Kim's lifestyle and the lifestyle of the New Class of North Korean leaders diminished not in the least. Faced with a transformed Russia and China North Korea no longer received the gifts of aid that propped the country for 40 years. With his nation in Kim Jung-il faced a desperate task to keep North Korea as a communist dictatorship. Only survived with him as an old school communist nation. North Koreans bowing to the statues of Kim Jong-il and his father at the Mansu Hill Grand Monument The inefficiency of North Korea's Stalinist-style collective agricultural system contributed to the disaster. North Korea spends about a quarter of its GDP on armaments including the development of nuclear weapons and keeps nearly all able-bodied males aged 18–30 in uniform while the basic infrastructure of the state is allowed to crumble. As a result North Korea now depends on international food aid to feed its population. Unspecified (but apparently large) amounts of aid in the form of food oil and coal are provided by China every year. the government announced a new policy called ""Songun "" or ""Military First."" Some analysts suggested that this meant the Korean People's Army was now more powerful than the Workers' Party. of South Korea actively attempted to reduce tensions between the two Koreas under the "" as the President of the United States in 2000 North Korea faced renewed pressure over its nuclear program. In July 2002 Kim announced some limited reforms. The government devalued the currency and allowed food prices to rise in the hope of stimulating agricultural production. Kim announced that food rationing systems as well as subsidized housing would be phased out. He introduced a ""family-unit farming system"" on a trial basis for the first time since collectivization in 1954. The government also set up a ""special administrative zone"" in Sinuiju a town near the border with China. The Central Committee granted the local authority near-autonomy especially in its economic affairs. Kim attempted to emulate the success of such free-trade zones in China but attracted little outside interest. Despite some optimistic talk in the foreign press the impetus of those reforms has not been followed with a large-scale decollectivization such as occurred in China under of South Korea actively attempted to reduce tensions between the two Koreas under the but that produced few immediate results. North Korea has faced renewed external pressure from the United Nations over its nuclear program reducing the prospect of international economic assistance. By labeling North Korea as a member of the ""axis of evil put the already embattled Kim in a dire situation contributing to his duplicity in on again agreements to end nuclear weapons building. Kim resorted to drug sales as well as highly expert counterfeiting of United States currency as a way to keep his dictatorship alive. North Korea missile launch July 5 Kim Jong-iI declared that ""money should be capable of measuring the worth of all commodities "" followed by some small market economy relaxations and announcing the creation of the Kaesong Industrial Region with transport links to . Experiments to allow factory managers to fire underperforming workers and give bonuses have begun. China’s investments in North Korea increased to $200 million in 2004. China has counseled North Korea’s leaders to gradually open the economy to market forces and Kim might successfully follow that path as well as China's policy of keeping political control firmly in the hands of the communist party. North Korea declared on Feb. 10 2005 that it had nuclear weapons bringing widespread calls for the North to return to the six-party talks aimed at curbing its nuclear program. Initially disputed by outside sources whether or not North Korea has nuclear weapons many Russian sources denied that North Korea has the technology necessary to build a nuclear weapon. On Monday North Korea has announced that it had successfully detonated a nuclear device underground at 10:36 am local time without any radiation leak. An official at South Korea's seismic monitoring center confirmed a magnitude-3.6 tremor felt at the time North Korea said it conducted the test had occurred unnaturally. North Korea has a very active missile development program although they have yet to successfully test their longer-ranged missiles. In 1998 North Korea tested a Taepondong-1 Space Launch Vehicle which successfully launched but failed to reach orbit. On July 5 they tested a Taepodong-2 ICBM that reportedly could reach the west coast of the U.S. in the 2-stage version or the entire U.S. with a third stage. However the missile failed shortly after launch. North Korea signed into an agreement with South Korea which stipulated North Korea would shut down its Yongbyon nuclear reactor in exchange for economic and energy assistance. However in 2009 the North continued its nuclear test program. the sinking of a South Korean naval ship allegedly by a North Korean torpedo and North Korea's shelling of Yeonpyeong Island escalated tensions between North and South. Kim and Moon meet at the DMZ in 2018 Kim Jong-il died on December 17 2011 and was succeeded by his son Kim Jong-un. In late 2013 Kim Jong Un's uncle Jang Song-thaek was arrested and executed after a trial. According to the South Korean spy agency Kim may have purged some 300 people after taking power. the United Nations Commission of Inquiry accused the government of crimes against humanity. North Korea tested the Hwasong-15 capable of striking anywhere in the United States of America. Estimates of North Korea's nuclear arsenal indicate it could have over 60 bombs probably including hydrogen bombs. In addition it is believed to possess chemical and biological weapons. North Korea sent an unprecedented high-level delegation to the Winter which passed on an invitation to South Korean President Moon Jae-in to visit the North. In April the two Korean leaders met at the where they announced their governments would work towards a denuclearized Korean Peninsula and formalize peace between the two states. North Korea announced it would change its time zone to realign with the South. Kim met American President Donald Trump at a summit in Singapore and signed a declaration again affirming a commitment to peace and denuclearization. South Korean President Moon visited Pyongyang for a summit with Kim. a second summit between Kim and Trump broke down without an agreement. On June 30 and Kim met at the DMZ. Talks in Stockholm began in October between US and North Korean negotiating teams but broke down after one day.

The pinkish red area is the Kamchatka Krai (Peninsula) plus some of the mainland to the north is a long body of land jutting dramatically from with a length of 1 250 km and an area of 270 000 km². It hangs off eastern Siberia along a general north-south axis each an arm of the it is one of the largest peninsulas in the world. Its shape has also been compared to a giant fish with the head at the south. The population density is one of the lowest in the world less than a person per square kilometer. The peninsula's isolation and abundance of wildlife make it a very likely long-term candidate for tourism development particularly for an environmentally minded and adventurous clientele. Great differences in climate appear along the length of the Kamchatka Peninsula. While the northern reaches clearly lie in the subpolar zone the central area has four distinct seasons and the seacoasts are likewise moderate. The longest stream is the Kamchatka River running nearly 700 kilometers from south to north creating what's called the peninsula's central valley which is flanked by large volcanic ranges. It is claimed that here are the world's highest density of volcanoes and associated volcanic phenomena. The highest of these is Klyuchevskaya Sopka (4 while the most striking is Kronotsky the perfect cone of which is considered by some the world's most beautiful volcano. In the center of Kamchatka is the increasingly renowned Geyser Valley Most inhabitants live in the regional capital Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky (named for saints Peter and Paul) a seaside city of about 220 000 founded on the southeastern side of the peninsula by the explorer Vitus Bering but a traditional way of life can still be seen in many scattered fishing and mining villages. chain runs from the southern tip of the peninsula to a short distance from Japan's northern Hokkaido Island. The arc thousands of kilometers from southern toward Asia. The westernmost islands in the chain are Russian territory and lie about 200 km from the middle coast of the Kamchatka Peninsula. with a depth of 10 similar to but not as deep as the trench that parallels the southern coast of the Aleutian chain. There have been very strong earthquakes that have shaken Kamchatka in the past all centered in the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench. A pair of megathrust earthquakes occurred off the coast on October 16 with magnitudes of ≈9.3 and 8.2 respectively. A chain of shallower earthquakes were recorded as recently as April 2006. A significant 7.7 magnitude earthquake with a shallow depth of 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) occurred in the Pacific Ocean 202 km (126 mi) ESE of Nikolskoye Kamchatka is the land of volcanoes. The part of the Kamchatka Peninsula that connects in the north to the rest of is only about 400 km south of the "" the belt of seismic and passes directly through the peninsula. The Kamchatka River and the surrounding central side valley are flanked by large volcanic belts containing around 160 volcanoes 29 of them still active. The peninsula has a high density of volcanoes and associated volcanic phenomena with 19 active volcanoes included in the World Heritage Sites. The cold climate and the volcanic rumblings and eruptions have given the peninsula the name of the ""Land of Fire and Ice."" A volcano is probably at least smoking or steaming somewhere on Kamchatka at any given moment and though there are some huge explosions they produce very few human victims because of the summits' remoteness and the sparseness of the peninsula's population. Opala volcano in the southern part of Kamchatka. seen here from the north with Karymsky volcano in the foreground. One of the most elegant Kamchatka volcanoes – Kronotsky the Russians began exploring what they claimed as the eastern reaches of their dominions. The first Russian maps showing Kamchatka as a peninsula appeared in the 1680s and continued to improve in the next decades following Bering's expeditions to eastern Russia and Alaska. Russian fur traders first established posts on the Kamchatka River but they nearly brought the indigenous tribes they were trading with to extinction via encroachment and disease. Small native groups still exist dispersed around the peninsula and some tourism for their livelihood. Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky missionaries were close behind the traders and worked in a large area that included all the Aleutians. The faith and the language they spoke remain the ones in use on Kamchatka today. several military bases were located across the peninsula which prevented all foreigners and even most Soviet citizens from visiting. In addition the military tested the range and reliability of their missiles by launching them from other sites using the peninsula as the target area. When a Korean Air Lines flight strayed deeply into Soviet airspace in 1983 it first crossed the Kamchatka Peninsula before being shot down near Sakhalin. The fighter jets that brought its demise and that of all 269 aboard were scrambled from a base on the peninsula. It was not until 1991 and the fall of the that Kamchatka started opening its doors for tourism. As in Alaska the contrasts of nature—the snow and heat the sea and the clear sky—make the peninsula a near-certain growing draw for tourists and other visitors. A large military presence remains on Kamchatka and is blamed by some as the source of small but growing pollution. a Russian Navy submarine was disabled in a submarine accident near the peninsula and sank to the seafloor requiring an international effort to rescue the crew. A Kamchatka Brown Bear in the spring Kamchatka has been called one of the last untouched places on earth. Its wildlife includes brown bears and golden eagles. The peninsula is also the breeding ground for Stellar's sea eagles The world's largest and densest population of brown bears makes Kamchatka home with a count estimated around 10 000. They are comparable in size to American grizzlies but are known as relatively docile. The largest animals in the world are abundant near the coastline. As early as 1882 the peninsula's sea otter population came under protection. Currently about 2 000 sea otters inhabit parts of southern Kamchatka's shoreline. The peninsula is thought to include the world's greatest diversity of fish in the is recognized as the largest spawning ground for salmon in Eurasia.

A truce has been in effect since 1953 yet the two Koreas are at war. Their weapons are formidable and war has been a possibility at any time since 1953. In the midst of that awful tension shrugging off a humiliating experience under Japan's colonial government rising from the rubble of the South Korea now belongs among the world's developed nations maintaining diplomatic relations with almost all nations in the world. subject to the approval of the National Assembly. The Constitution requires the president and prime minister to report periodically to the legislature on foreign affairs. The president appoints envoys without confirmation; legislative consent is required for treaties and stationing foreign troops within the national borders (Article 60 of the Constitution). The president directs the Agency for National Security Planning which is comparable to a combination of the United States Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation. National Assembly of South Korea located in Yeouido The National Assembly maintains the Foreign Affairs Committee which reports regularly in plenary sessions of the assembly. The assembly may also establish ad hoc committees to consider questions of special importance to the state. Prime Minister and Minster of Foreign Affairs and has actively participated in United Nations agencies and international forums. South Korea belongs to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) as well as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. the former foreign minister of South Korea sits as the incumbent Secretary-General of the United Nations. Korean demilitarized zone on the North Korean side. relations between North and South Korea have been strained. Official though irregular and highly secret contact did not occur until in 1971; these meetings led to contacts and family reunification projects but not to a peace treaty or lessening of military tensions. Subsequent inter-Korean relations may be divided into five periods: The first stage between 1972 and 1973; the second stage P'yongyang's delivery of relief goods to South Korea after a typhoon caused devastating floods in 1984; the third stage the exchange of home visits and performing artists in 1985; the fourth stage activated by Nordpolitik under Roh. Roh's initiative built upon the 1972 three basic principles for Korean reunification: 1) Reunification by peaceful means 2) by transcending ideological differences (nationalism) and 3) without external interference (self-determination). The fifth stage followed the 1997 election of and his ""Sunshine Policy"" of engagement with North Korea. continued by the following administration of president Roh Moo-hyun economic ties between the two countries increased sent to North Korea and some divided families have been briefly reunited. Military ties remain fraught with tension and in 2002 a brief naval skirmish left four South Korean sailors dead leaving the future of the Sunshine policy uncertain. North Korea cut off talks but the South remained committed to the policy of reconciliation and relations began to thaw again. The resurgence of the nuclear issue two years later would again cast relations in doubt but South Korea has sought to play the role of intermediary rather than antagonist and economic ties at the time seemed to be growing again. Despite the Sunshine Policy and efforts at reconciliation the progress was complicated by North Korean missile tests in 1993 2006 and 2009. As of early 2009 relationships between North Korea and South Korea were very tense; North Korea had been reported to have deployed missiles Ended its former agreements with South Korea and threatened South Korea and the United States not to interfere with a satellite launch it had planned. As of 2009 North Korea and South Korea are still opposed and share a heavily fortified border. 2009 North Korea media declared that the armistice is no longer valid due to the South Korean government's pledge to ""definitely join"" the Proliferation Security Initiative. To further complicate and intensify strains between the two nations is the sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan in March 2010 killing 46 seamen. A team of researchers around the world claimed it was caused by a North Korean torpedo which the North denied. South Korea agreed with the findings from the research group and president Lee Myung-bak declared in May 2010 that Seoul would cut all trade with North Korea as part of measures primarily aimed at striking back at North Korea diplomatically and financially. As a result of this North Korea severed all ties and completely abrogated the previous pact of non aggression. the Unification Ministry officially declared the Sunshine Policy a failure thus bringing the policy to an end. On November 23 North Korean artillery shelled Yeonpyeong with dozens of rounds at Yeonpyeong-ri and the surrounding area. Moon Jae-in was elected President of South Korea with a promise to return to the Sunshine Policy. Beginning with North Korea's participation in the 2018 Winter Olympics the relationship has seen a major diplomatic breakthrough and become significantly warmer. In April 2018 the two countries signed the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace Prosperity and Unification of the Korean Peninsula. In 2018 a majority of South Koreans approved the new relationship. The summits between North and South Korea have also facilitated positive relationships between North Korea and the United States. However tensions between the two countries remain. when the U.S. helped establish South Korea and fought on its (1950–1953). During the following four decades South Korea experienced tremendous economic South Korea has become a partner rather than a dependent nation opening new opportunities and new strains in the United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met with South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun March 20 2005 at the presidential house in Seoul. the United States stood as South Korea's largest and most important trading partner while South Korea ranked as the seventh-largest market for United States goods and the second largest market for its agricultural products. United States congress under pressure to find a cure for an imbalance in trade with South Korea and other nations sought to improve the balance. A free trade agreement (FTA) between South Korea and the United States became controversial leading to fears among the Korean people of a loss of the rapid gain in quality of life and increased per-capita income. South Koreans protested against FTA talks. Security renegotiations also tried the new partnership. Most Koreans believed that United States forces should remain in South Korea as long as Seoul needed them 94 percent of South Koreans supported the presence of United States forces. Stability in the peninsula required a strong Seoul-Washington military cooperation to deter North Korean aggression. A small faction voiced the demand that United States troops should gradually leave South Korea. In Washington an increasing number of United States policymakers supported that view. Consultations on restructuring the Washington-Seoul security relationship took place in February 1990 marked a shift in U.S. policy to a supporting role in South Korea's defense and increasing support of defense expense. The United States' role in the May 1980 Gwangju uprising was the single most pressing South Korean political issue of the 1980s. Even after a decade Gwangju citizens and other Koreans still blamed the United States for its perceived involvement in the bloody uprising. Washington's policymakers applauded Nordpolitik as a necessary adjustment of the relationship between Seoul and Moscow. However the South Korean press contributed to a distorted zero-sum notion of the situation—if ties with the Soviet Union improve then it must cause strains in the relationship with the United States. In his February 1989 speech to the South Korean National Assembly defined continuity and change as the guideposts in Seoul-Washington relations. The relations between the United States and South Korea greatly strengthened under the Lee Myung-bak administration. At the 2009 G-20 London summit called South Korea ""one of America's closest allies and greatest friends."" South Korean President Moon Jae-in with U.S. President Donald Trump in November 2017 In a June 2010 open letter from President of South Korea Lee Myung-bak published in the he expressed gratitude for the 37 000 Americans who were killed in the Korean War defending South Korea saying that they fought for the freedom of South Koreans they did not even know. He stated that thanks to their sacrifices the peace and democracy of the South Korean state was protected. Active South Korean-Chinese people-to-people contacts have long been encouraged. Academics and particularly families divided between South Korea and the (PRC) were able to exchange visits freely in the late 1980s. Trade between the two countries has continued to increase. Furthermore China has attempted to mediate between North Korea and the United States and between North Korea and Japan. China has also initiated and promoted tripartite talks between North and South Korea and the United States. South Korea had long been an ally of Taiwan. Diplomatic ties between Seoul and Taipei were nevertheless severed in 1992. Formal diplomatic relations were established between Seoul and Beijing on August 24 (by then only in control of the island of Taiwan and a few outlying areas) severed diplomatic relations with South Korea in advance of its announcement of formal recognition of the People's Republic of China based in said in 2002 that since then relations between the two governments have been ""in a rut."" 1882 Map of Japan and Korea South Korea's relations with Japan still deal with the aftermath of Japan's occupation of Korea including the Sea of Japan naming dispute visits by successive Japanese Prime Ministers to the Yasukuni Shrine and the disputed ownership of Liancourt Rocks (known as in Japan). Since normalizing relations in 1965 Seoul and Tokyo have held annual foreign ministerial conferences to discuss trade the status of the Korean minority population in Japan the content of textbooks dealing with the relationship and Tokyo's relationship with North Korea. Japan's government officials have been issuing statements of regret and apology for actions during the colonization of Korea. Those remarks began with ambiguous apologies that seemed to lack sincerity in 1965 to clear unambiguous apologies in 2003. Prime Minister Koizumi Junichiro's statement made in Pyongyang constitutes the clearest statement of apology: in a spirit of humility the facts of history that Japan caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of Korea through its colonial rule in the past and expressed deep remorse and heartfelt apology. Roh's Nordpolitik helped ease tensions with Tokyo over their approach to P'yongyang. In 1996 announced that the South Korea-Japan would jointly host the 2002 FIFA . The next few years would see leaders of both countries meet to warm relations in preparations for the games. The year 2005 was designated as the ""Japan-South Korea Friendship Year."" the Liancourt Rocks controversy erupted again when Japan's Shimane prefecture declared ""Takeshima Day "" inciting mass demonstrations in South Korea. A political cartoon by Georges Ferdinand Bigot (1860-1927) titled fishing for the rights to own Seoul-Moscow relations entered a new era in the 1980s. Roh's Nordpolitik and 's ""New Thinking"" had much in common as they attempted to reverse their nations' courses. Gorbachev had signaled Soviet interest in improving relations with all countries in the Asia-Pacific region as set forth his July 1986 Vladivostok and August 1988 Krasnoyarsk speeches. Improved Seoul-Moscow relations occurred in three arenas: Sports and political relations. The Seoul Olympics provided a major catalyst. The Soviets eager to participate in the games received honored treatment at the Olympics from South Korea. Seoul and Moscow have been natural partners. South Korea sought trade with the Soviet Union even before Gorbachev came to power. Gorbachev desired foreign capital and high technology as well as Seoul's help in alleviating the Soviet economic crisis through direct investment and trade. South Korea offers a source of badly needed consumer goods and managerial skills. and fish—that South Korea desperately needs. The United States encouraged South Korea's expanding trade with Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union initially although Washington later expressed concerned over high-technology transfers to Russia. Seoul and Moscow began trading directly from facilities near Vladivostok and Pusan. Several major South Korean businesses including Daewoo and Lucky-Goldstar traded directly with the Soviet Union in 1990. The Korean Trade Promotion Corporation (KOTRA) and the Soviet Chamber of Commerce and Industry exchanged a trade memorandum in 1988 pledging mutual assistance in establishing trade offices in 1989. South Korea's wealth and technology Roh Tae-wo and Kim Young Sam visited Moscow in the late 1980s. Kim Young Sam participated in talks with the newly elected chairman of the Supreme Soviet academician Yevgeni Primakov. In a joint statement the Reunification Democratic Party (RDP) and IMEMO pledged to promote closer trade and cultural ties between the two nations. The Kremlin announced that it would allow some 30 since the end of World War II to return permanently to South Korea—clearly a reflection of the continuing improvement in Seoul-Moscow relations. Moscow arranged a Seoul-P'yongyang meeting. Kim met with Ho Tam chairman of the Committee for Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland (CPRF) in Moscow. In June 1990 Roh held his first summit with President Gorbachev in San Francisco. These relations continued by the Russian Federation on December 27 1991. Russian president Vladimir Putin visited Seoul in February 2001 while South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun visited Moscow Russia in September 2004. Russian Federal Space Agency and the Korean Astronaut Program cooperated together to send South Korea's first astronaut into space. Yi So-Yeon became the first South Korean national as well as the third woman to be the first national in space on April 8 South Korea has been active in the becoming a member in 1991 at the same time as assumed the post of UN Secretary-General serving in that post until December 31 In addition to holding membership in the United Nations South Korea is a member of the WTO and G-20.

The ingredients of discontent seemed lacking — at least on the surface. The colonies were not in a state of economic crisis; on the contrary they were relatively prosperous. Unlike the Irish no groups of American citizens were clamoring for freedom from England based on national identity. was not particularly despotic — surely not to the degree his predecessors of the previous century had been. the colonies were not unified. discovered this quite clearly when he devised the "" would have brought the colonial rivals together to meet the common threat of the French and Indians. Much to Franklin's chagrin this plan was soundly defeated. Ben Franklin sketched this cartoon to illustrate the urgency of his 1754 Albany Plan of Union. He unsuccessfully tried to bring the colonies together to defend themselves against Indian and French threats. in a few short years did everything change? What happened to make the American colonists most of whom thought of themselves as English subjects want to break the ties that bound them to their forebears? What forces led the men and women in the 13 different colonies to set aside their differences and Much happened between the years of 1763 and 1776. The colonists felt unfairly taxed and ignored in their attempts to address grievances. Religious issues rose to the surface economics were the essence of many debates. the British found the colonists unwilling to pay their fair share for the administration of the Empire. After all citizens residing in England paid more in taxes than was asked of any American during the entire time of crisis. The 1770 Boston Massacre was only one in a series of events that led American colonists to revolt against Britain. This was not the first time American colonists found themselves in dispute with Great Britain. But this time the cooler heads did not prevail. Every action by one side brought an equally strong response from the other. The events during these important years created sharp divisions among the English people and between the English and the Colonists. the geographic distance between England and the colonies became more and more noticeable. It took England time to respond to Colonial provocations and to administer the settled areas of America. Further some now questioned how it could be that a tiny island nation could contain and rule the American continent. the point of no return was reached. and spent many millions ... We were only reimbursed ... a very small part of what we spent. -Benjamin Franklin.

It is signed by activists and academics from Syria and more than forty other countries in Africa and appears in multiple languages: English Since the beginning of the Syrian uprising ten years ago and especially since Russia intervened in Syria on behalf of Bashar al-Assad there has been a curious and malign development: the emergence of pro-Assad allegiances in the name of “anti-imperialism” among some who otherwise generally identify as progressive or “left ” and the consequent spread of manipulative disinformation that routinely deflects attention away from the well-documented abuses of Assad and his allies. Portraying themselves as “opponents” of imperialism they routinely exhibit a highly selective attention to matters of “intervention” and human rights violations that often aligns with the governments of Russia and China; those who disagree with their highly-policed views are frequently (and falsely) branded as “regime change enthusiasts” or dupes of western political interests. The divisive and sectarianizing role played by this group is unmistakable: in their simplistic view all pro-democracy and pro-dignity movements that go against Russian or Chinese state interests are routinely portrayed as the top-down work of Western interference: none are autochthonous none are of a piece with decades of independent domestic struggle against brutal dictatorship (as in Syria) and none truly represent the desires of people demanding the right to lives of dignity rather than oppression and abuse. What unites them is a refusal to contend with the crimes of the Assad regime or even to acknowledge that a brutally repressed popular uprising against Assad took place. These writers and outlets have mushroomed in recent years and have often positioned Syria at the forefront of their criticisms of imperialism and interventionism which they characteristically restrict to the west; Russian and Iranian involvement is generally ignored. In doing so they have sought to align themselves with a long and venerable tradition of internal domestic opposition to the abuses of imperial power abroad not only but quite often issuing from the left. But they do not rightfully belong in that company. No one who explicitly or implicitly aligns themselves with the malignant Assad government does. No one who selectively and opportunistically deploys charges of “imperialism” for reasons of their particular version of “left” politics rather than opposing it consistently in principle across the globe — thereby acknowledging the imperialist interventionism of Russia Often under the guise of practicing “independent journalism ” these various writers and outlets have functioned as chief sources of misinformation and propaganda about the ongoing global disaster that Syria has become. Their reactionary inverted Realpolitik is as fixated on top-down anti-democratic “power politics” as that of Henry Kissinger or Samuel Huntington just with the valence reversed. But this maddeningly oversimplifying rhetorical move (“flipping the script” as one of them once put it) as appealing as it might be to those eager to identify who the “good guys” and “bad guys” are at any given place on the planet is really an instrument of tailored flattery for their audiences about the “true workings of power” that serves to reinforce a dysfunctional status quo and impede the development of a truly progressive and international approach to global politics one that we so desperately need given the planetary challenges of responding to global warming. The evidence that US power has itself been appallingly destructive especially during the Cold War is overwhelming: all across the globe from Vietnam to Indonesia to Iran to Congo to South and Central America and beyond the record of massive human rights abuses accumulated in the name of fighting Communism is clear. And in the post-Cold War period of the so-called “War on Terror ” American interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq have done nothing to suggest a fundamental national change of heart. America is not central to what has happened in Syria despite what these people claim. The idea that it somehow is all evidence to the contrary notwithstanding is a by-product of a provincial political culture which insists on both the centrality of US power globally as well as the imperialist right to identify who the “good guys” and the “bad guys” are in any given context. The ideological alignment of rightwing admirers of Assad with this kind of authoritarian-friendly “leftism” is symptomatic of this and indicates that the very real and very serious problem lies elsewhere: what to do when a people is as abused by their government as the Syrian people have been held captive by those who think nothing of torturing and murdering people for even the slightest hint of political opposition to their authority? As many countries move closer and closer to authoritarianism and away from democracy this seems to us a profoundly urgent political question to which there is yet no answer; and because there is no answer all across the globe there is growing impunity on the part of the powerful and growing vulnerability for the powerless. these “anti-imperialists” have no helpful words. About the profound political violence visited upon the Syrian people by the Assads the Russians? No words. Forgive us for pointing out that such erasure of Syrian lives and experiences embodies the very essence of imperialist (and racist) privilege. These writers and bloggers have shown no awareness of the Syrians including signatories to this letter who risked their lives opposing the regime who have been incarcerated in the Assads’ torture prisons (some for many years) had friends and family forcibly disappeared fled their country – even though many Syrians have been writing and speaking about these experiences for many years. Syrian experiences from the Revolution to the present pose a fundamental challenge to the world as it appears to these people. Syrians who directly opposed the Assad regime did not do so because of some Western imperialist plot but because decades of abuse and corruption were and remain intolerable. To insist otherwise is to attempt to strip Syrians of all political agency and endorse the Assads’ longstanding policy of domestic politicide which has deprived Syrians of any meaningful say in their government and circumstances. We Syrians and supporters of the Syrian people’s struggle for democracy and human rights take these attempts to “disappear” Syrians from the world of politics and partnership as quite consistent with the character of the regimes these people so evidently admire. This is the “anti-imperialism” and “leftism” of the unprincipled and only reinforces the dysfunctional international gridlock exhibited in the UN Security Council. We hope that readers of this piece will join us in opposing it.

There will be a panel on April 17 at 5 p.m. Eastern on this subject called “Denouncing the Anti-Imperialism of the Asses”.  It will be a bit broader than this letter condemning also the “leftists” tyrants of Latin America as well as his Highness Assad.  Speakers include Michael Karadjis Linda Quiquivix and Shiyam Galyon.  Robert Cuffy will moderate.  See rpm.world for details. Excellent statement ! Thanks for doing this. How do we sign on? Right on! Death to imperialism from all fronts and any country that thwarts the aspirations for self-determination of any people anywhere and death to dictators who target civilian populations. This is one of the most bizarre articles i have read about Syria. To say that US does not play central role hear is so absurd. Without US war machine and its support of Israel Saudis and ISIS Syria might still be a livable country. This is exactly the kind of foolish comment the letter was pointing to. What role did US support for Israel have in the Syrian debacle? And what US support was there for ISIS? Most US aid to Syrian rebels was on condition that they don’t fight Assad and at the same time Washington made sure that the rebels didn’t get the defensive weapons they needed most — anti-aircraft weapons to challenge Assad’s decisive advantage in the air. Washington’s involvement was not nearly as significant as that of Russia and Iran. I’m really impressed by the arguments in the widely-supported statement against the anti-imperalism of some western left commentators about the political situation in Syria. Up until reading this piece I situated myself in that ‘camp’ too. I certainly have a big bias against the imperial role that the US plays out around the world…in a way that China Russia as imperial powers do not. They seem focused at the moment on their immediate historic spheres of influence. So for me it was a case of the enemy of my enemy is my friend which is problematic I know but there you have it;) What I do find problematic about the statement is its position of the role that the US has played in the Syrian conflict from the very beginning. From what I read at the time the US was promoting regime change in Syria because it wanted to establish another ‘coloured revolution’ on Russia’s border like it is currently carrying out in the Ukraine. To bring that about they were financing and arming the democratic resistance against Assad. Is this not true? If it isn’t true then why are US troops occupying parts of Syria at the moment except for its own imperial designs? It’s also my understanding that Iran is supporting Syria because it knows it’s next on the US list for regime change. And I sure don’t support the Iranian religious state and how it is suppressing the more secular democratic movements there but I sure do understand it doesn’t want to taken over by a US supporting regime either. It seems odd to me to lump Iran in with Russia and China as imperialist because it is trying to protect itself from the US.

1620763873.410521,68415555,https://newpol.org/review/the-occlusion-of-political-economy/,"(New Politics Vol. XVIII No. 2 Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents Isabel Wilkerson is by trade a journalist and a storyteller. In her previous book which garnered scores of awards she traced the Great Migration of Blacks escaping the yoke of oppression in the South to less perilous lives in Northern cities. She narrates this history through the lives of three people perhaps a record for what Clifford Geertz coined “thick description.” Tomes have been written by historians and sociologists documenting the Great Migration but none with a riveting title like which conveys the human ramifications and drama of this turning point in African American history. With her genius for storytelling Wilkerson narrated “the untold story” of the Great Migration. Wilkerson breaks out of the lexical stranglehold associated with the term “race.” Her revelation was that there are compelling affinities among different forms of subjugation and domination ranging from centuries of slavery in the United States to the untouchables in India and Jews in Nazi Germany. I am going to sidestep the debates among critics who insist that these systems of hierarchy are not comparable. For Wilkerson the affinities provide stark proof that subjugation and domination take varied forms. And with her trademark as a wordsmith in the United States is the visible agent of the unseen force of caste. Caste is the bones race the skin. Race is what we can see the physical traits that have been given arbitrary meaning and become shorthand for who the person is. Caste is the powerful infrastructure that holds each group in place.” This is the acuity and captivating prose that speak to Wilkerson’s readers as she brings to light the multifarious ways in which caste and race are the twin toxins of the human spirit. Her penetrating optic and voluminous research allow her to ferret out a deep and detailed account of the lived experience of the victims of race and caste. Ultimately her storytelling engenders a reluctant awareness of muted complicity. This is where thick description allows readers—and white readers in particular—to bear witness to the horrors and soul-killing facets of race and caste. Her adroit storytelling jumps off the page and we should not be surprised that Ava DuVernay has found the raw material for her next film. Few Americans have more than flimsy knowledge that slavery existed for almost two centuries before the colonies revolted against English rule. Indeed Gerald Horne has persuasively argued that the American Revolution of 1776 was precipitated by fear that the English were on the verge of eliminating slavery in the colonies. Nor is it generally known that the Constitution that declared in its Preamble that “all men are created equal” also sanctioned slavery which persisted for eight decades until finally dismantled by a Civil War that culminated with the emancipation of slaves through the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865—though without any restitution whatsoever for centuries of unpaid labor. Our culture and political institutions do little to raise consciousness of the extent that racism is baked into the fabric of American society. Against this background the unexpected uprising of youth after the police murder of George Floyd was a rare wake-up call that the shadow and legacy of slavery still sully American society and make a chimera of our flawed democracy. Let me provide an example of Wilkerson’s wordcraft as it pertains to the recent scourge of police killings of Black men even when they pose no threat to police. What is this if not lynching by another name? These murders are meted out with impunity and rarely exposed in newspapers much less courts of law. Against this background consider Wilkerson’s understated but breathtaking depiction of a “lynching tree”: In the middle of Main Street in a southern American town there stood a majestic old tree an elm or an oak or a sycamore that had been planted before modern roads were paved. It held a sacred place in the hearts of the townspeople though it was an altogether inconvenient location for a shade tree. It blocked traffic and motorists were forced to curve around it to get through town. It was the potential cause of many accidents given that motorists could not always see past it or know for sure who had the right of way. And yet it could not be cut down. It was the local lynching tree and it was performing its duty to “perpetually and eternally” remind the black townspeople of who among them had last been hanged from its limbs and who could be next. The tree was awaiting its appointed hour and the white townspeople were willing to risk inconvenience to keep the tree and the subordinate caste in their places. The tree bore silent witness to black citizens of their eternal lot it whispered reassurances to the dominant caste of theirs. Wilkerson does not spare her readers graphic and gory portrayals of the savage mutilation of Black bodies and even the prize collection of body parts as souvenirs. Her account resonates with Eric Lott’s provocative analysis of lynching postcards that were sent to loved ones. Wilkerson singles out one such postcard from Waco “This is the Barbecue we had last night. My picture is to the left with the cross over it. Your son I noted above that Wilkerson is by trade a journalist and a storyteller though I hasten to add that she has taught and lectured at hundreds of colleges and universities across the nation. It is noteworthy that this 500-page book centered on race and caste has climbed to the top of the it behooves us to pick up the other end of the stick and engage another version of storytelling. Wilkerson is not oblivious to the uses of caste both to elevate and enrich the higher caste and to consign the lower castes to perpetual subordination and degradation. The problem is that she ambiguously attributes this disparity to “history” and “tradition.” As a result and therefore when she reaches the end of book she has no vision for eliminating caste beyond an exhortation to dispense with the atavisms of the past and to cultivate our common humanity. Readers are left to lament the horrors and injustices of caste without stopping to contemplate the extent to which domination and suppression are anchored in major political and economic institutions. No doubt many readers like it that way lest they are confronted with their own complicity and expected to forgo the advantages and privileges of caste. Or lest they are called upon to pay reparations for centuries of plunder of Black labor as is advocated by Black activists such as Manning Marable William A. Darity and A. Kirsten Mullen. capitalism and colonialism receive only peripheral treatment in Wilkerson’s narrative. To be sure slavery receives copious treatment in but the book stops short of addressing the of slavery and its relevance to the present which would lead to a critique of how the legacy of slavery is embedded even today in our retrograde democracy. Instead readers are left to ponder and to envision “A World Without Caste In 1847—15 years before the Civil War—Karl Marx offered another narrative that shed light on the political economy of slavery. Marx wrote “Without slavery there would be no cotton without cotton there would be no modern industry.” In one epigrammatic sentence Marx summed up the relationship of slavery to the emerging industrial revolution in the United States and England. Cotton provided the raw material that was exported to nascent textile industries in New York and Birmingham which exploited the labor of women who produced clothing for global markets. Indeed one can trace the entire history of the slave trade as providing the labor that spawned the early phases of both capitalism and colonialism. Thus it can be said without hyperbole that American capitalism was built on the backs of slaves. Small wonder that America’s founders shrugged off the two congenital evils—slavery and colonialism—as “a necessary evil.” Wilkerson has delivered on her promise to tell the story of caste with vibrant and revelatory prose. I am less impressed with the professional reviewers who fell over each other with vacuous encomiums about this “instant classic.” Sadly missing are thoughtful critiques that challenge readers to think beyond their comfort zone. consider the following review in the a left publication with a focus on issues of race and racism. The reviewer is an organizer with Philadelphia’s Saturday Free School and a radical and activist. To quote Monteiro reviewer called Isabel Wilkerson’s new book Caste: The Origins of Our Discontent “an instant American classic and almost certainly the keynote nonfiction book of the American century thus far.” It is neither. Oprah says it “might well save us.” It won’t. … Wilkerson’s arguments turn attention away from actual racial and class conditions to a non-material and made-up reality she calls caste. … In the name of caste she flips reality on its head from working people to their alleged deeply held beliefs; beliefs so deep in their consciousness that they seldom recognize them. Such analysis works in polite parlor discussion or in university faculty lounges but is completely meaningless to the lived experiences of Black folk and workers. Monteiro has “picked up the other end of the stick.” He brings to light the limits of storytelling despite its compelling optic on the wrongs of the past. Beyond that it is imperative that we shift the focus from the sins of the past to the powerful structures and institutions that to consign Blacks disproportionately to the fringes of American society and its system of rewards. My contention is that the high point of the civil rights revolution was the passage of landmark legislation in 1964 and 1965 and that we have been moving backward ever since. As early as 1968 Where Do We Go from Here Martin Luther King Jr. conveyed his apprehension that the Civil Rights Movement was moving backward not forward. As he wrote The step backward has a new name today. It is called the “white backlash.” But the white backlash is nothing new. … The white backlash is an expression of the same vacillations the same search for rationalizations the same lack of commitment that has always characterized white Americans on the issue of race. King already feared that the writing was on the wall: “Blacks got their rights and they should ask for nothing more.” the three major initiatives of the civil rights era—school desegregation and voting rights—have all been eviscerated or rolled back thanks in large part to the perversity of the Federalist Society in conjunction with the increasingly reactionary Supreme Court. The euphoria over the election of the first Black president was quickly extinguished with the election of Donald Trump and the surge of the far right. Yet to be seen is whether this is the dying gasp of white supremacy or whether racism has emerged with renewed force regardless of the outcome of the 2020 election. There is much political work to be done to repair the damage of Trumpism not to speak of the possibility of even more dangerous demagogues on the horizon. Just as Wallace was a premonition of Trump we cannot be sure that the American cocktail—of racism and other retrograde proclivities—is not also prone to recrudescence. is a longstanding contributor to New Politics.

At the same time Marx himself reminded us long ago in speaking of the development of classes in England where they were “most classically developed this class articulation does not emerge in pure form.” is much broader than those who are employed at any one time. Relying only on workforce figures obscures important aspects of the broader working-class life those in and out of employment form the core of the working class once seen as a male domain but today nearly half composed of women. Furthermore both space and research limitations dictate that this article will focus on the employed and near-employed sections of this global class. With these caveats in mind we look first at the growth of the global working-class labor force in the twenty-first century. The contemporary driving forces behind this dynamic have been the uneven globalization of capitalism generally with the simultaneous rise of multinational corporations following World War II; the falling rate of profit that began in the late 1960s drove capital beyond its older boundaries and produced recurring crises; the opening of the former bureaucratic “Communist” economies to capitalism; and more recently the deepening of global value chains (GVC). The last mentioned have been developing for some time but in the last couple of decades have shaped economic growth and change in many developing economies by pulling the formerly unpaid homework of reproduction and pre-existing domestic supply chains into the sphere of the value-producing chains of multinational capital. This has dislocated some industries and jobs in the developed economies but has mostly resulted in expansion into new areas. So although the share of world production in the developed countries has fallen both the United States and the EU produce more added value today than twenty or thirty years ago. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO) the world labor force grew by 25 percent from 2000 to 2019. Those “employed” for an income grew from 2.6 billion to 3.3 billion over those first two decades of the twenty-first century also by 25 percent. Of those “employed” in ILO terms 53 percent were wage or salary earners up from 43 percent in 1996; 34 percent were considered “own-account” workers up from 31 percent in 1996; 11 percent “contributing family” workers down from 23 percent in 1996; and 2 percent employers down from 3.4 percent in that year. Obviously not even all of the non-employers in this ILO count are working class. Many are salaried professionals or managers of various sorts and so on. Here it is likely that about two-thirds or a little over 2 billion of those considered employed by the ILO are working class. These working-class employed workers are not just those in the wage and salary sectors however. Many of those considered “own-account” or self-employed workers as well as “contributing family” workers are in fact locked into the capital-labor employment relationship via the expanded and deepened domestic and global value chains that have characterized capitalist growth for some time. “Own-account” or self-employed workers are often simply misclassified by employers to dodge taxes and responsibility for these workers. Women are far more likely than men to be informally employed. is a legal definition of workers outside of most forms of state regulation of employment. By this definition most workers in Marx’s time were “informal.” As Ursula Huws puts it concerning various forms of unpaid labor of reproduction or of “unproductive” (of surplus value) individual service provision “The history of capitalism can be regarded synoptically as the history of the dynamic transformation of each of these types of labor into another with (as Marx predicted) the overall effect of driving a higher and higher proportion of human labor into the ‘productive’ category where it is disciplined by the World Bank notes that “homebased” workers make up a considerable proportion of the lower end of global corporate value (supply) chains. Furthermore studies of the impact of such supply chains show that a huge involvement of “informal”-sector workers classified as “own-account” or “contributing family” employees in South Asia and across the developing world are commonly incorporated into GVCs. These corporate-dominated supply chains don’t just connect developing economies to multinational corporations. They reconfigure the local economy and workforce to corporate needs. Even if the majority of workers in a country are not directly connected to a corporate value chain and gender balance are set for most workers by the dynamics and speed of the multinationals’ “just-in-time” GVCs. As Bhattacharya and Kesar point out the growth of capitalist manufacturing in India has increased the informal sector because it is cheaper to source from formerly petty commodity producers and to deal with household workers where the women provide both (poorly) paid labor and the unpaid labor of reproduction that reduces the cost of each worker. Far from being “pre-capitalist ” such informal employment is a product of universalizing capitalism. GVCs grew from about 45 percent of world trade in the mid-1990s to almost 55 percent in 2008 before falling somewhat to about half. the fastest growing sectors have been those associated with the infrastructure and operation of these GVCs. According to ILO estimates employment in transportation and communications grew by 83 percent and that in construction by 118 percent in the first two decades of the twenty-first century faster than any other major sectors. In terms of direct employment these sectors are composed largely of male workers. Nevertheless an important result of the growth of GVCs has been the rise of women from 40 percent of the employed workforce in 2000 to almost half (49 percent) in 2019 while in manufacturing that depends on these value chains women increased from 41 percent to 44 percent by 2019. more and more workers have also been drawn “inside the knot” of capital’s social relations of production via the growing commodification of both public services and the previously unpaid labor of social reproduction via the capitalist organization of services previously performed by the state for wages or in the home or community without pay. Disproportionate numbers of these workers are women who compose two-thirds of workers in education An indication of this trend is the rapid increase in “market services ” from 20 percent of employment in the ILO’s definition in 1991 to 31 percent in 2018. Another is the decline of “public capital” and assets as a share of national wealth in all of the leading industrial countries to less than 10 percent for most. When looking at the recomposition of the working class in the developed countries it is common to point to the rise of services and the decline of goods production assuming this amounts to a diminution of the working class. In fact the line between the two is largely an obfuscation of how value is created by the global working class in contemporary capitalism. Service production is also increasingly dominated by giant corporations and involved in GVCs with its share of value-added trade rising from 31 percent in 1980 to 43 percent by 2009. It is important to bear in mind that goods production is essential to the provision of services and vice versa. There are no services performed without “things” and there are no goods produced without the input of “services.” The labor involved in both is meant to produce surplus value. The use value of the commodity it produces is secondary. While global service sector employment has grown by 61 percent in the first two decades of the twenty-first century the international industrial workforce has increased by 40 percent. This relative difference in growth is partly due to the continuing rise of productivity in global manufacturing at a faster rate than the world economy as a whole rather than a diminution of industrial output. even in this period of slower growth grew by 123 percent in current dollars or about half that in real terms from 2000 to 2019. Overall contrary to the notion of a “post-industrial” world the manufacturing workforce grew from 393 million in 2000 to 460 million in 2019 and mining) workforce grew from 536 million to 755 million over this period. This does not include workers in transportation who are also essential to goods production and composed an additional 226 million workers by 2019 up from 116 million two decades earlier. Together this industrial “core” amounted to 41 percent of the world’s nonagricultural workforce as of 2019. the industrial workers of the world remain a massive core of value production and the working population. The growth of the world’s production and was not evenly spread across the globe. While the developed countries still produce the largest share of manufacturing value added (MVA) the developing countries have increased their share from 18 percent in 1990 to about 40 percent in 2019 while that of the industrialized nations fell from 79 percent to 55 percent over that period. The EU share dropped from 33 percent of world MVA output in 1990 to 22 percent in 2018 while that of Asia rose from 24 percent to 37 percent over that period. China alone rose from about 5 percent of world MVA output in 2000 to 20 percent in 2018. Recently much of Asia’s increased share of MVAwent just four countries: China and the Republic of Korea. Employment followed suit with the industrialized nations’ share of manufacturing jobs dropping from 30 percent in 1991 to 18 percent in 2018. the growth of “informal” work and the growing role of women in both have occurred primarily in the developing world. and war-related dislocation and dispossession have produced a growing international migrant population. The number of people living outside their home country has grown from 173 an increase of 57 percent. Most of these migrants were of working age were women. About 111 million were classified by the International Organization for Migration as migrant workers in 2017 returning remittances to their homeland of $689 billion in 2018. At least a half billion people receive these remittances contributing significantly to the social reproduction of the global working class and thus lowering labor costs to international capital. As Ferguson and McNally have pointed out missing the role of migrant labor “loses sight of international processes of dispossession and primitive accumulation whose cross-border movements are at the heart of the worldwide production and reproduction of capital and labor.” Thus an additional 111 million workers move in and out of the ILO’s static figures on employment and the process of class formation particularly in important centers of production like the United States Capital as a whole has done extremely well by the geographic changes reorganization of production and the labor process and even the crises of the system as a whole. Overall in most developed and in developing economies whether real wages fell or rose of labor income in GDP fell from the mid-1970s with some ups and downs that of capital rose. As an indication of this the share of national income of the top 10 percent rose while that of the bottom 50 percent fell in all the major economies. Poverty remains a central feature of labor in developing nations despite claims of its reduction achieved largely by manipulating the definition of poverty. Even in Europe once the pinnacle of the welfare state social-democratic theorist Wolfgang Streeck notes “What follows will analyze the trajectory of European social policy over the as it has mutated from a projected federal social-democratic welfare state to a program for competitive adjustments to global markets.” the working class has lost out everywhere. Much of this increased inequality was due to the relative decline of unions and the subsequent wage stagnation in the developed economies the continued increases in manufacturing productivity across the world and the increasing incorporation of low-wage formal and informal workers in developing countries into the world’s production systems. These trends have contributed to increased rates of exploitation everywhere. As political economist Anwar Shaikh argues “The overall degree of income inequality ultimately rests on the ratio of profits to wages on the division of value added. Boosting this ratio for capital were advanced methods for the surveillance and standardization of work that ultimately impact workers everywhere. Technology and the Control of Labor For hundreds of millions of workers across the globe labor remains primarily a draining physical effort seemingly removed from the high tech regime of automation and digital management that has come to intensify work. No matter where or how a worker is employed their speed and effort are driven by this digital measurement and direction of work all along the vast “just-in-time” corridors of capital that now span the world. What has changed most in the nature of work in the last two decades is the degree and application of digital technologies that monitor and direct the work of individuals and groups. the efforts of Taylorism and lean production to quantify and thereby control individual and collective labor regardless of what product or service it produces. The digitalization of much work-related technology means work can be measured and broken down into nanoseconds as opposed to Taylor’s minutes and seconds and given a precision absent from lean production’s simple elimination of “waste” via “management-by-stress.” It also means that every aspect of work becomes quantified. Simplification via quantification enables speed and speed demands quantification. Stress can be measured but not emotion the effects of professional training or the tacit skills of all workers. All of this applies to services already transformed in the twentieth century from domestic service and jobs performed by local tradesmen or small firms to corporate providers then reorganized along lean lines and now digitally driven—from call centers to hotels to building maintenance. Today’s digitally driven measurements also apply to professional work in fields such as health care and education. Data is harvested from workers and then used against them in these fields as in a factory or warehouse. So teachers are measured by student grades (allegedly the teacher’s product) on standardized tests based on “standardized knowledge ” and they are forced to “teach to test.” Meanwhile hospital nurses can be tracked by GPS and directed by algorithmic Clinical Decision Support Systems that recommend standard treatments. Or they can be replaced by less qualified and less costly workers performing standardized tasks. Because these are mostly women workers performing “emotional labor ” the emotional content of the job is taken as an unacknowledged freebie for capital—the unpaid aspect of labor of social reproduction performed on the job rather than in the home. Amazon is the most-cited exemplar of digitally driven workers for good reason. A recent study of an Amazon fulfilment center in California described the context in which employees work: “In order to choreograph the brutal ballet that ensues once a consumer clicks ‘place your order’ for next-day delivery on Amazon Prime the company leverages its algorithmic and technical prowess within its massive network of communication and digital technology as it numerically ‘flexes’ its workforce up and down in sync with fluctuating consumer demand.” In identical facilities across the globe the work itself is guided by scanners and hand-held or wrist-mounted computers that track and guide workers to the correct product. Workers are allowed thirty minutes a shift of “off task” time time when they are not in motion. In addition they are pushed by Kiva robots who also pick products. It is the prototype of work everywhere unless worker resistance curbs it. Another dimension to today’s workplace technology is seldom mentioned: Like the global workforce itself that in the Amazon warehouse is multiracial and multinational. As the international Black Lives Matter upsurge of 2020 underlined while particularly deeply entrenched in the United States are worldwide and embedded since the days of slavery and colonialism. Racism under capitalism is not only a means of dividing working-class people but of imposing working-class status on those racial or ethnic groups whose “life chances” are limited by racial or ethnic barriers. It is a force in class formation. Hence African Americans are disproportionately working class and poor. While capitalism may have inherited racism from the era of slavery and colonial conquest it has nevertheless allocated work and workers on unequal racial and national bases for generations. the technology that sorts out workers by occupation and so on bears the marks of that heritage. Artificial intelligence and algorithms are programmed by human beings raised in this historic context who more often than not possess many of its age-old often unconscious assumptions while at the same time using data necessarily based in the past. As one analyst put it “The past is a very racist place. And we only have data from the past to train Artificial Intelligence.” A mathematician’s argument about the racial outcomes of AI programs used by police to “predict” high-crime areas applies in every aspect of life: Racially biased data “creates a pernicious feedback loop” reinforcing racial stereotypes and worker allocation and racial “life chances.” One of the more outrageous examples is that of facial-recognition technology which is used by employers and police departments and which routinely fails to distinguish dark complected individuals from one another. It is scarcely an accident that most of the poorly paid overworked workers in that California Amazon warehouse are Latinx or black. Racism is one of capital’s weapons of class struggle now embedded in its technology. The same applies to gender and sexism. For example the Clinical Support Decision Systems imposed on nurses are based on clinical studies that “systematically excluded women and minorities.” Labor and the Control of the Corridors of Capital and capital that characterize domestic production and shape the world of labor on a deepening international material infrastructure for moving products and value throughout of the world. These material corridors of capital consist mainly of familiar roads and traditional warehouses. But they now include massive urban-based logistics clusters of facilities and labor miles of fiber-optic cables employed widely only since the late 1990s data centers that are even newer in application and warehouses reconfigured for movement rather than storage and transformed by technology. This mostly embedded infrastructure is created by and dependent on the labor of millions of workers who build and maintain it. If technology imposes controls the dependence of infrastructure on continuous labor inputs provides workers with their own potential control—the ability to slow down or stop capital’s relentless movement of value and Marx saw transportation and communications as part of value production. the tens of millions of workers across the world in these embedded repositories of fixed constant capital and data centers that move commodities and finances across this infrastructure are production workers as much as those in factories or sites of service delivery. They make the circuits of capital function and provide much of the speed at which those circuits turn over. It is over and through these paths of transportation and communication that these circuits of capital move with Marx’s familiar formula being sequentially and simultaneously repeated millions of times a day. The speed at which this happens determines the potential profit. speed and “just-in-time” delivery have become major features of contemporary production and logistics. This is as true of those working in the movement of data and money as those driving on a road or working in a factory all those workers who are merging living labor power with accumulated dead labor to produce value. None of this infrastructure nor the capital equipment that runs over and through it comes to life without the hand and mind of labor. Even the most automated system requires constant maintenance and repair. For example Amazon’s 39 supposedly fully automated data centers in the United States and Ireland employed ten thousand workers to keep them humming. What is called “the cloud” or cyberspace is nothing more than an extended material complex of fiber-optic cables “People think that data is in the cloud but it’s not. It’s in the ocean.” Actually it’s also on and under the land as well as under the sea following paths originally laid in the mid-nineteenth century for telegraph cables. Today’s fiber-optic cables carry 95 percent of internet traffic. The whole connected material system and its parts are highly vulnerable and breaks or disruptions are frequent. The system is laid and repaired by workers on cable ships those in cable stations around the world workers employed by national telecom companies and those in the proliferating number of huge data centers that as James Bridle put it “generate vast amounts of waste heat and require corresponding quantities of cooling from acres of air conditioning systems.” require human labor to run. At every point in this seemingly immaterial movement of data and money there are workers of various kinds and differing skills without which there would be no motion. There is no digitalization without human manipulation. In a period of relatively low levels of capital investment countless billions have been poured into the extension and deepening of this infrastructure. Looking at a somewhat broader measure of infrastructure Price Waterhouse Coopers estimates that $1.7 trillion was invested by private sources in infrastructure from 2010 to 2017 in a sector in which government investment often plays the major role. harbors and canals dug or dredged As large as these new investments are they represent only the initial cost and labor input. As Akhil Gupta argues about the many new infrastructure projects around the world “As soon as the project is completed and officially declared to be open the “dead” labor involved in infrastructure requires the constant input of living labor over its entire functioning “life.” A major force of this infrastructure expansion has been Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative launched in 2013. This has funded a network of super highways rail lines (three from China to Europe) and airports that “spreads into the Pacific and deep into Africa” as well as the Middle East and Europe. By 2015 China had set aside $890 billion to spend on 900 projects. it was “focused on energy and transportation with an overall potential investment estimated at about $1.4 trillion—a scale never before seen ” according to analyst Daniel Yergin. Such ventures mean the employment of huge numbers of workers across the vast spaces of Central and South Asia who bring these projects to life and can shut them down as well. An Era of Rebellion: Class or Multitude? All of this has occurred in a period of economic turbulence and recurring crises a climate crisis that can no longer be ignored and most recently the COVID-19 pandemic. Each of these has contributed to one degree or another to a dramatic upsurge in social activism and mass mobilization in opposition to the status quo and mobilizations have resulted from economic change and distress sometimes exacerbated by war. But they have been political in that they were mostly directed at governments and the neoliberal policies and accompanying corruption that have inflicted pain on the majority of people across the globe. The international upsurge that began with the Arab Spring 2011 and continued and even accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 has been far too massive to be described in detail here. Rather I will try to analyze some of its major characteristics and the role of the working class in this general upsurge. According to an analysis of “civil unrest” in 2019 by the risk-assessment firm Versisk Maplecroft or almost a quarter of all nations saw major civil disruptions in 2019 alone. This count shows these protests sweeping every region of the world other than North America. it missed some important actions in North America the huge Black Lives Matter upsurge and the July mass street mobilizations and strikes in Puerto Rico. Adding to this “civil unrest” were new highly visible mass mobilizations and on-going demonstrations in 2020 in Belarus and Russia’s far east; mass strikes in Indonesia; as well as the Black Lives Matter upsurge across the United States and much of the world. Many of these mobilizations were started by students or activists of various class backgrounds so the question of just what role working-class people and organizations played in all of this “civil unrest” needs to be addressed. David McNally has analyzed “the return of the mass strike” in considerable detail. Looking at mass strikes since the 2008 recession Across the decade since the Great Recession we have witnessed a series of enormous general strikes (Guadeloupe and Martinique and many more) as well as strike waves that have helped to topple heads of state (Tunisia there have been mass strikes of various sizes around the world often linked to issues of social reproduction including the 2018-2019 teachers strikes in the United States. As McNally emphasizes the mass strike has also been adopted by the women’s movement notably in the International Women’s Strikes that swept 50 nations in 2017 and 2018 in the name of the “feminism of the 99 percent.” Some mass strikes have occurred in the midst of broader mobilizations in streets and squares across the world such as those in Hong Kong That working-class action has been at the center of the upsurge can be seen in a few general figures. The European Trade Union Institute calculates that between 2010 and 2018 there were 64 general strikes in the European Union almost half of them in Greece. looking at just 56 countries 000 work stoppages between 2010 and 2019 mostly in manufacturing. The ILO author notes the number of strikes “could be far greater than 44 694 strikes between 2015 and 2017 in a wide variety of industries. Lu Chunsen estimates 3 220 strikes by manufacturing workers in China from 2011 to May 2019 despite the precarious nature of work the mass internal migration to the cities and the government’s ban on strikes. Here we see a clear example of the merging of informal migrant workers with the formal workforce—and their subsequent actions. We know that unions played important roles in many of the recent struggles even where middle-class leaders put themselves in front of the masses. In Belarus an interview on the BBC with a union leader revealed he was one of the top leaders of the rebellion. Furthermore participants report that the demonstrations were “expanding into a wider working-class movement involving widespread workplace mobilizations.” In a detailed analysis of the Arab Spring Anand Gopal notes that while unionized workers played a key role of most Arab rebellions in the initial stages of the Syrian upsurge the fragmented working-class masses came first from the shanty towns and that “the movement’s rank and file consisted of precarious semi-employed workers who simply did not possess the structural power to threaten the Syrian elite.” much of the mass base of 2011 came from both the organized working class and the informal workers in most Arab countries would have been at one time or another drawn into the GVC of multinational capital working in the oil fields and in the many ports of the Middle East and North Africa. Gopal argues that their very precariousness and informal employment means they had little power. Yet such workers have organized themselves in their neighborhoods and through national trade unions as well as in workplaces to storm the streets and squares as workers have done for generations. The seemingly mixed-class appearance of many of the mass strikers and demonstrators was also a result of the “proletarianization” of educated people such as teachers and nurses whose jobs had been standardized and subjected to tighter management by the processes described above as well as the descent of many educated “millennials” into working-class jobs. Here the lines of class appear blurred but the social destiny of the majority of this generation and the next is clearly working class. Some of these show up in strikes of “platform” workers or delivery and other workers newly discovered as “essential” to social reproduction in the context of the pandemic which is likely to accelerate this social transformation. What seems clear is that whether or not students played an initiating role and middle-class professionals and politicians co-opted leadership roles the mass base of most rebellions of the last decade was working class in composition and that to a considerable extent they employed the traditional weapon of the mass strike. This was the case whether or not they were union members or held permanent employment much like the masses Rosa Luxemburg analyzed in the 1905 Russian Revolution whose strikes “display such a multiplicity of the most varied forms of action.” This whole period has been an example of working-class self-activity with both economic and political demands. nowhere did the strikes or mass mobilizations seek political power for the workers themselves or a program approaching socialism. Nowhere were the working class or mixed classes in transition organized for such goals. In some cases there did not appear to be recognizable leaders. Yet the participants were organized in “a multiplicity of the most varied forms of action” and organizations often through networks enabled by social media. The difficulty in analyzing the potential of this era of rebellion is compounded by the uncertain impact of the three crises of capitalism and in particular the effect of the pandemic on a variety of industries and the GVCs. Such speculation is for another article. The most useful understanding of the potential of the current upsurge is best described by McNally “The new strike movements are harbingers of a period of of militant working-class cultures of resistance the very soil out of which socialist politics can grow.” will help produce a general working-class upsurge is impossible to predict. But as United Electrical Workers representative Mark Meinster writes in “Working-class upsurges often happen in the context of deep social changes in society as a whole such as abrupt and widespread economic dislocation a profound loss of legitimacy by ruling elites That just about describes the situation labor faces across the world today.

If you have bookmarks or links to our site on your blog or website (also Krsna or Hari Krishna) is a major god and considered the eighth incarnation of . He is perhaps the most popular of all the heroes of Hindu . Krishna's adventures are recounted in the and the sacred collection of texts known as the where Krishna is described as the Supreme Being and creator of the universe. The most ancient tales of Krishna involve his adventures with the Pandava princes whilst later stories accumulated over the centuries which describe his eventful youth when Krishna used his proficient weapons skills to good effect to defeat a host of fearsome enemies According to tradition Krishna belonged to the Yadava - a pastoral race - and the god's birth is picturesquely described in the the great Hindu god pulled two hairs from his own head one white and one black. The black hair was planted into the womb of Devaki and so Krishna was born into the Pandava family his earthly father being Vasudeva. Unfortunately for Krishna his mother's brother had been warned that Devaki's eighth child would kill him and so Kamsa determined to murder the eighth child a crime he had already carried out seven times before Krishna was born. Fortunately Vasudeva took the precaution of hiding Krishna in the remote village of Vrindavana where the boy was brought up as a simple cowherd (in this guise he can be referred to as Govinda). There he spent an idyllic childhood and stirred the hearts of many gopis or herd- Krishna's dual role is as the punisher of human deeds but also as a bringer of enlightenment. Thus the story of Krishna contains a double concealment - Krishna is both a god disguised as a mortal and a prince disguised as a commoner. Accordingly the myths contain many metaphors of disguise such as a spark within a pile of ashes or a mighty sword in its scabbard and these hint at Krishna's dual purpose as the punisher of human deeds but also as a bringer of enlightenment. Krishna's foster parents at Vrindavana were Nanda and Yashoda and his brother Balarama. Krishna's favourite wife was Radha with whom he had a son Pradyumna and daughter Carumati but tradition has it that the god actually acquired 16 an earthly form of the goddess is considered Krishna's second most favoured wife after Radha. Krishna was involved in many escapades in his adventurous youth. Notable amongst these are his various killings and thrashings of prominent enemies such as the ogress Putana and the king of the Hayas (horses). Also swiftly dealt with was the scheming tyrant Kamsa – after whose beheading Krishna established himself as king of Mathura. Krishna slew many demons: Muru and his 7 Pralamba – who Krishna beat up using only his fists Naraka – son of the Earth and who had accumulated a harem of 16 and the sea-demon Pancajana who looked like a conch shell and who lost his magic shell to Krishna which the hero carried thereafter and used as a trumpet. Krishna also found time to lift the mountain Govardhana to foil a terrible deluge sent by the floating city of the Titans ( got the better of the sea-god Varuna and even managed to steal the divine discuss possessed by the fire-god .

Krishna Manifesting His Full Glory to Arjuna Krishna acted as the warrior-prince Arjuna's charioteer in the Great . It was on the eve of this battle that Krishna recounted the sacred song of the Lord Krishna highlights that the self is quite separate from the body and continues throughout time: 'Never was there a time I did not exist nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to exist' ( that Krishna also states that 'All this universe has been created by me; all things exist in me'. Arjuna tells us that Krishna is 'divine In other adventures Krishna built the great fortress city of Dvaraka in Gujarat known as the 'City of Gates'. Seven days after Krishna was accidentally killed by a hunter's arrow striking his heel Dvaraka was submerged beneath the ocean. Krishna had also stolen the sacred Parijata tree from Indra defeating the god in the process. Krishna planted the tree at Dvaraka The worship of Krishna may have started as early as the 5th century BCE. Today he is worshipped as the supreme Hindu god by many believers and he is especially revered in Bengal and Udupi in southern . One of the many festivals held in his honour is the festival in Puri which commemorates Radha's successful attempt to persuade Krishna to return to Vrindavana. Perhaps the most widely observed festival is the Krishna Janmashtami (mid-August to early September) which involves devotees fasting for 24 hours offering milk sweets to the baby Krishna lighting wicks soaked in ghee (purified butter) in the ritual known as Krishna is typically portrayed in Hindu art with a dark skin (usually blue-black) and he may carry the cakra discus Vajranabha and the club Kaumodaki – both given to him by Agni. He typically wears a yellow robe has a peacock feather in his long black hair and commonly plays a flute. In reference to his occupation as a cowherd in his youth Krishna is often accompanied with cows. In art the most popular scene of Krishna's adventures is the lifting of Mt.

In places where pandemic restrictions are easing companies must embrace this unique opportunity to retain the beneficial practices they adopted during the crisis. To do so effectively leaders must be thoughtful about identifying which have been successful and deliberate in ensuring that the changes stick. The authors present a four-step framework to help leaders identify and sustain the changes that have been successful in the past year. First identify which new practices were successful and under which circumstances they’re expected to continue to succeed. Second reduce the influence of symbols connected to old practices. Third openly discuss and resolve disagreements and misconceptions about the new procedures. Finally turn the new practices into habits. As vaccines are being shipped and administered the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on people’s lives and the business environment will gradually lessen over time. This will be a welcome change but organizations must resist a complete reversion to their pre-pandemic practices. While the crisis imposed severe restrictions it also provided a unique opportunity to conduct thousands of experiments and innovate with new practices some of which are beneficial in any period — pandemic or no pandemic. In addition the crisis lowered the resistance to change and thus helped organizations get rid of deeply entrenched dysfunctional practices that would be difficult to shed in normal times. Many organizations were forced to do things that would have been considered inconceivable not so long ago. In addition to many companies’ successful banks disbursed loans without meeting clients company audits without visiting company premises But what will happen to these practices once the pandemic is over? Our research on the shows that sustained organizational changes depend not only on the but also on ensuring that managers and employees don’t fall back into old routines . The following four-step framework will help leaders identify and sustain the beneficial changes that were introduced over the past year. 1. Identify which new practices should be sustained In the early days of the pandemic circumstances forced companies to react and experiment in swift and pragmatic ways. Most companies followed one unequivocal dictum: Keep pace and survive. Now it’s time to make space to reflect. companies should identify which new practices were successful and under which circumstances they’re expected to continue to succeed. New practices are more likely to be retained and sustained if managers and employees . Survey employees to understand what they did differently during the crisis and then conduct follow-up discussions about what succeeded for them and what didn’t. Distill the efforts that were successful into common organizational procedures translating them into documentation and communicating new expected practices to employees. 2. Reduce the influence of symbols connected to old practices We’re notorious creatures of habit. Given two choices we’ll almost certainly opt for the . Old habits and their signals are not only ingrained in our brains but they’re also embedded in our surrounding environment. in organizations that can trigger relapse. Manipulating or removing those symbols while online teaching was reasonably successful in universities during the first wave of the pandemic (at least for certain subjects or classes) there is a strong call for wholesale reversion to lecture halls after the summer. University administrators are facing pressure from trustees to justify the existence of massive university infrastructure and from students and their parents to resume face-to-face teaching or reduce fees. As a result many administrators have begun forcing instructors to conduct a minimum percentage of classes in lecture halls irrespective of whether a physical class is necessary. would be a careful determination of which classes facilitate co-creation of knowledge and necessitate interpersonal interactions and physical proximity and therefore require bringing students and instructors into the same classroom at the same time versus those that are just instructors’ monologues and best done virtually. Century-old university procedures may not necessarily be the best practices for all learning occasions. Yet universities retain the symbols that facilitate reversion — classrooms We encourage organizations to unlearn dysfunctional practices by reducing influences of old knowledge structures that can hinder the adoption of new ones. This requires three steps: Question and reconsider the explicit and implicit criteria by which employees are evaluated — for example whether they come to the office regularly and on time. Scrutinize and eliminate activities that were considered a norm previously but are no longer required — for example daily in-person morning meetings held in a conference room at the office. Identify and change triggers that make people retrieve old norms — for example if you had a tradition of having a group pizza lunch on Friday host it in a video conference­-enabled room so that people working from home can join. 3. Openly discuss and resolve disagreements and misconceptions about the new procedures Even after changes have been implemented . As long as these old assumptions are ingrained in individuals’ cognitive framework and there are disagreements about them going forward one of the companies where we’re doing research initiated a dialogue among employees about the work-from-home mandate that was implemented during the pandemic. Now that conditions are becoming conducive to a return to offices the company is discussing a permanent remote work policy. We identified three distinct groups of employees based on their perceptions of the original change. One group was enthusiastic about it and demanded that it be sustained. Another group was comfortable with the change given the extraordinary circumstances but believed that it should be reversed once the pandemic is over. The third group never wanted the change and couldn’t wait for a reversion to the old practice. Although the shift to remote work was initially implemented on an organization-wide basis management didn’t know about the differences in people’s hidden perceptions about them. Unearthing these camps and their different assumptions helped the organization reflect on and set uniform expectations for each other which allowed them to create more nuanced work-from-home policies that balanced the needs of all three groups. change has been implemented does more harm than good. In order to make change sustainable everyone must have a similar and punishment and rewards associated with new procedures. For example in-office meetings shouldn’t be held on days employees are allowed to work from home make that clear. If an in-person meeting on one of those days is unavoidable make sure employees understand that they won’t be penalized for participating virtually. Bringing varying opinions and perceptions to the surface and settling them will help align those expectations. 4. Turn new practices into habits only if they’re turned into habits. In the final step of our framework organizations must make sure that good practices are cemented into the organizational reality. The tendency to fall back into established routines creeps in every day. It’s important to go beyond initial rollouts and information sessions to regularly reinforce the new practices. This involves reminding people what the new procedures are until they don’t feel new anymore. It’s almost like reminding drivers about new speed bumps and lane changes for a period of time until they get used the new quirks. Instead of hoping that employees will automatically internalize changes as new routines organizations must repeatedly communicate their benefits while providing incentives for their adoption and potential disincentives for their non-adoption. After several trials In places where pandemic restrictions are easing companies must embrace this unique opportunity to retain the beneficial practices they adopted during the crisis. To do so effectively leaders must be thoughtful about identifying which have been successful and deliberate in ensuring that the changes stick. is the Coxe Distinguished Professor at Dartmouth College’s Tuck School of Business and faculty partner at the Silicon Valley incubator bestselling author.

At the same time Marx himself reminded us long ago in speaking of the development of classes in England where they were “most classically developed this class articulation does not emerge in pure form.” is much broader than those who are employed at any one time. Relying only on workforce figures obscures important aspects of the broader working-class life those in and out of employment form the core of the working class once seen as a male domain but today nearly half composed of women. Furthermore both space and research limitations dictate that this article will focus on the employed and near-employed sections of this global class. With these caveats in mind we look first at the growth of the global working-class labor force in the twenty-first century. The contemporary driving forces behind this dynamic have been the uneven globalization of capitalism generally with the simultaneous rise of multinational corporations following World War II; the falling rate of profit that began in the late 1960s drove capital beyond its older boundaries and produced recurring crises; the opening of the former bureaucratic “Communist” economies to capitalism; and more recently the deepening of global value chains (GVC). The last mentioned have been developing for some time but in the last couple of decades have shaped economic growth and change in many developing economies by pulling the formerly unpaid homework of reproduction and pre-existing domestic supply chains into the sphere of the value-producing chains of multinational capital. This has dislocated some industries and jobs in the developed economies but has mostly resulted in expansion into new areas. So although the share of world production in the developed countries has fallen both the United States and the EU produce more added value today than twenty or thirty years ago. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO) the world labor force grew by 25 percent from 2000 to 2019. Those “employed” for an income grew from 2.6 billion to 3.3 billion over those first two decades of the twenty-first century also by 25 percent. Of those “employed” in ILO terms 53 percent were wage or salary earners up from 43 percent in 1996; 34 percent were considered “own-account” workers up from 31 percent in 1996; 11 percent “contributing family” workers down from 23 percent in 1996; and 2 percent employers down from 3.4 percent in that year. Obviously not even all of the non-employers in this ILO count are working class. Many are salaried professionals or managers of various sorts and so on. Here it is likely that about two-thirds or a little over 2 billion of those considered employed by the ILO are working class. These working-class employed workers are not just those in the wage and salary sectors however. Many of those considered “own-account” or self-employed workers as well as “contributing family” workers are in fact locked into the capital-labor employment relationship via the expanded and deepened domestic and global value chains that have characterized capitalist growth for some time. “Own-account” or self-employed workers are often simply misclassified by employers to dodge taxes and responsibility for these workers. Women are far more likely than men to be informally employed. is a legal definition of workers outside of most forms of state regulation of employment. By this definition most workers in Marx’s time were “informal.” As Ursula Huws puts it concerning various forms of unpaid labor of reproduction or of “unproductive” (of surplus value) individual service provision “The history of capitalism can be regarded synoptically as the history of the dynamic transformation of each of these types of labor into another with (as Marx predicted) the overall effect of driving a higher and higher proportion of human labor into the ‘productive’ category where it is disciplined by the World Bank notes that “homebased” workers make up a considerable proportion of the lower end of global corporate value (supply) chains. Furthermore studies of the impact of such supply chains show that a huge involvement of “informal”-sector workers classified as “own-account” or “contributing family” employees in South Asia and across the developing world are commonly incorporated into GVCs. These corporate-dominated supply chains don’t just connect developing economies to multinational corporations. They reconfigure the local economy and workforce to corporate needs. Even if the majority of workers in a country are not directly connected to a corporate value chain and gender balance are set for most workers by the dynamics and speed of the multinationals’ “just-in-time” GVCs. As Bhattacharya and Kesar point out the growth of capitalist manufacturing in India has increased the informal sector because it is cheaper to source from formerly petty commodity producers and to deal with household workers where the women provide both (poorly) paid labor and the unpaid labor of reproduction that reduces the cost of each worker. Far from being “pre-capitalist ” such informal employment is a product of universalizing capitalism. GVCs grew from about 45 percent of world trade in the mid-1990s to almost 55 percent in 2008 before falling somewhat to about half. the fastest growing sectors have been those associated with the infrastructure and operation of these GVCs. According to ILO estimates employment in transportation and communications grew by 83 percent and that in construction by 118 percent in the first two decades of the twenty-first century faster than any other major sectors. In terms of direct employment these sectors are composed largely of male workers. Nevertheless an important result of the growth of GVCs has been the rise of women from 40 percent of the employed workforce in 2000 to almost half (49 percent) in 2019 while in manufacturing that depends on these value chains women increased from 41 percent to 44 percent by 2019. more and more workers have also been drawn “inside the knot” of capital’s social relations of production via the growing commodification of both public services and the previously unpaid labor of social reproduction via the capitalist organization of services previously performed by the state for wages or in the home or community without pay. Disproportionate numbers of these workers are women who compose two-thirds of workers in education An indication of this trend is the rapid increase in “market services ” from 20 percent of employment in the ILO’s definition in 1991 to 31 percent in 2018. Another is the decline of “public capital” and assets as a share of national wealth in all of the leading industrial countries to less than 10 percent for most. When looking at the recomposition of the working class in the developed countries it is common to point to the rise of services and the decline of goods production assuming this amounts to a diminution of the working class. In fact the line between the two is largely an obfuscation of how value is created by the global working class in contemporary capitalism. Service production is also increasingly dominated by giant corporations and involved in GVCs with its share of value-added trade rising from 31 percent in 1980 to 43 percent by 2009. It is important to bear in mind that goods production is essential to the provision of services and vice versa. There are no services performed without “things” and there are no goods produced without the input of “services.” The labor involved in both is meant to produce surplus value. The use value of the commodity it produces is secondary. While global service sector employment has grown by 61 percent in the first two decades of the twenty-first century the international industrial workforce has increased by 40 percent. This relative difference in growth is partly due to the continuing rise of productivity in global manufacturing at a faster rate than the world economy as a whole rather than a diminution of industrial output. even in this period of slower growth grew by 123 percent in current dollars or about half that in real terms from 2000 to 2019. Overall contrary to the notion of a “post-industrial” world the manufacturing workforce grew from 393 million in 2000 to 460 million in 2019 and mining) workforce grew from 536 million to 755 million over this period. This does not include workers in transportation who are also essential to goods production and composed an additional 226 million workers by 2019 up from 116 million two decades earlier. Together this industrial “core” amounted to 41 percent of the world’s nonagricultural workforce as of 2019. the industrial workers of the world remain a massive core of value production and the working population. The growth of the world’s production and was not evenly spread across the globe. While the developed countries still produce the largest share of manufacturing value added (MVA) the developing countries have increased their share from 18 percent in 1990 to about 40 percent in 2019 while that of the industrialized nations fell from 79 percent to 55 percent over that period. The EU share dropped from 33 percent of world MVA output in 1990 to 22 percent in 2018 while that of Asia rose from 24 percent to 37 percent over that period. China alone rose from about 5 percent of world MVA output in 2000 to 20 percent in 2018. Recently much of Asia’s increased share of MVAwent just four countries: China and the Republic of Korea. Employment followed suit with the industrialized nations’ share of manufacturing jobs dropping from 30 percent in 1991 to 18 percent in 2018. the growth of “informal” work and the growing role of women in both have occurred primarily in the developing world. and war-related dislocation and dispossession have produced a growing international migrant population. The number of people living outside their home country has grown from 173 an increase of 57 percent. Most of these migrants were of working age were women. About 111 million were classified by the International Organization for Migration as migrant workers in 2017 returning remittances to their homeland of $689 billion in 2018. At least a half billion people receive these remittances contributing significantly to the social reproduction of the global working class and thus lowering labor costs to international capital. As Ferguson and McNally have pointed out missing the role of migrant labor “loses sight of international processes of dispossession and primitive accumulation whose cross-border movements are at the heart of the worldwide production and reproduction of capital and labor.” Thus an additional 111 million workers move in and out of the ILO’s static figures on employment and the process of class formation particularly in important centers of production like the United States Capital as a whole has done extremely well by the geographic changes reorganization of production and the labor process and even the crises of the system as a whole. Overall in most developed and in developing economies whether real wages fell or rose of labor income in GDP fell from the mid-1970s with some ups and downs that of capital rose. As an indication of this the share of national income of the top 10 percent rose while that of the bottom 50 percent fell in all the major economies. Poverty remains a central feature of labor in developing nations despite claims of its reduction achieved largely by manipulating the definition of poverty. Even in Europe once the pinnacle of the welfare state social-democratic theorist Wolfgang Streeck notes “What follows will analyze the trajectory of European social policy over the as it has mutated from a projected federal social-democratic welfare state to a program for competitive adjustments to global markets.” the working class has lost out everywhere. Much of this increased inequality was due to the relative decline of unions and the subsequent wage stagnation in the developed economies the continued increases in manufacturing productivity across the world and the increasing incorporation of low-wage formal and informal workers in developing countries into the world’s production systems. These trends have contributed to increased rates of exploitation everywhere. As political economist Anwar Shaikh argues “The overall degree of income inequality ultimately rests on the ratio of profits to wages on the division of value added. Boosting this ratio for capital were advanced methods for the surveillance and standardization of work that ultimately impact workers everywhere. Technology and the Control of Labor For hundreds of millions of workers across the globe labor remains primarily a draining physical effort seemingly removed from the high tech regime of automation and digital management that has come to intensify work. No matter where or how a worker is employed their speed and effort are driven by this digital measurement and direction of work all along the vast “just-in-time” corridors of capital that now span the world. What has changed most in the nature of work in the last two decades is the degree and application of digital technologies that monitor and direct the work of individuals and groups. the efforts of Taylorism and lean production to quantify and thereby control individual and collective labor regardless of what product or service it produces. The digitalization of much work-related technology means work can be measured and broken down into nanoseconds as opposed to Taylor’s minutes and seconds and given a precision absent from lean production’s simple elimination of “waste” via “management-by-stress.” It also means that every aspect of work becomes quantified. Simplification via quantification enables speed and speed demands quantification. Stress can be measured but not emotion the effects of professional training or the tacit skills of all workers. All of this applies to services already transformed in the twentieth century from domestic service and jobs performed by local tradesmen or small firms to corporate providers then reorganized along lean lines and now digitally driven—from call centers to hotels to building maintenance. Today’s digitally driven measurements also apply to professional work in fields such as health care and education. Data is harvested from workers and then used against them in these fields as in a factory or warehouse. So teachers are measured by student grades (allegedly the teacher’s product) on standardized tests based on “standardized knowledge ” and they are forced to “teach to test.” Meanwhile hospital nurses can be tracked by GPS and directed by algorithmic Clinical Decision Support Systems that recommend standard treatments. Or they can be replaced by less qualified and less costly workers performing standardized tasks. Because these are mostly women workers performing “emotional labor ” the emotional content of the job is taken as an unacknowledged freebie for capital—the unpaid aspect of labor of social reproduction performed on the job rather than in the home. Amazon is the most-cited exemplar of digitally driven workers for good reason. A recent study of an Amazon fulfilment center in California described the context in which employees work: “In order to choreograph the brutal ballet that ensues once a consumer clicks ‘place your order’ for next-day delivery on Amazon Prime the company leverages its algorithmic and technical prowess within its massive network of communication and digital technology as it numerically ‘flexes’ its workforce up and down in sync with fluctuating consumer demand.” In identical facilities across the globe the work itself is guided by scanners and hand-held or wrist-mounted computers that track and guide workers to the correct product. Workers are allowed thirty minutes a shift of “off task” time time when they are not in motion. In addition they are pushed by Kiva robots who also pick products. It is the prototype of work everywhere unless worker resistance curbs it. Another dimension to today’s workplace technology is seldom mentioned: Like the global workforce itself that in the Amazon warehouse is multiracial and multinational. As the international Black Lives Matter upsurge of 2020 underlined while particularly deeply entrenched in the United States are worldwide and embedded since the days of slavery and colonialism. Racism under capitalism is not only a means of dividing working-class people but of imposing working-class status on those racial or ethnic groups whose “life chances” are limited by racial or ethnic barriers. It is a force in class formation. Hence African Americans are disproportionately working class and poor. While capitalism may have inherited racism from the era of slavery and colonial conquest it has nevertheless allocated work and workers on unequal racial and national bases for generations. the technology that sorts out workers by occupation and so on bears the marks of that heritage. Artificial intelligence and algorithms are programmed by human beings raised in this historic context who more often than not possess many of its age-old often unconscious assumptions while at the same time using data necessarily based in the past. As one analyst put it “The past is a very racist place. And we only have data from the past to train Artificial Intelligence.” A mathematician’s argument about the racial outcomes of AI programs used by police to “predict” high-crime areas applies in every aspect of life: Racially biased data “creates a pernicious feedback loop” reinforcing racial stereotypes and worker allocation and racial “life chances.” One of the more outrageous examples is that of facial-recognition technology which is used by employers and police departments and which routinely fails to distinguish dark complected individuals from one another. It is scarcely an accident that most of the poorly paid overworked workers in that California Amazon warehouse are Latinx or black. Racism is one of capital’s weapons of class struggle now embedded in its technology. The same applies to gender and sexism. For example the Clinical Support Decision Systems imposed on nurses are based on clinical studies that “systematically excluded women and minorities.” Labor and the Control of the Corridors of Capital and capital that characterize domestic production and shape the world of labor on a deepening international material infrastructure for moving products and value throughout of the world. These material corridors of capital consist mainly of familiar roads and traditional warehouses. But they now include massive urban-based logistics clusters of facilities and labor miles of fiber-optic cables employed widely only since the late 1990s data centers that are even newer in application and warehouses reconfigured for movement rather than storage and transformed by technology. This mostly embedded infrastructure is created by and dependent on the labor of millions of workers who build and maintain it. If technology imposes controls the dependence of infrastructure on continuous labor inputs provides workers with their own potential control—the ability to slow down or stop capital’s relentless movement of value and Marx saw transportation and communications as part of value production. the tens of millions of workers across the world in these embedded repositories of fixed constant capital and data centers that move commodities and finances across this infrastructure are production workers as much as those in factories or sites of service delivery. They make the circuits of capital function and provide much of the speed at which those circuits turn over. It is over and through these paths of transportation and communication that these circuits of capital move with Marx’s familiar formula being sequentially and simultaneously repeated millions of times a day. The speed at which this happens determines the potential profit. speed and “just-in-time” delivery have become major features of contemporary production and logistics. This is as true of those working in the movement of data and money as those driving on a road or working in a factory all those workers who are merging living labor power with accumulated dead labor to produce value. None of this infrastructure nor the capital equipment that runs over and through it comes to life without the hand and mind of labor. Even the most automated system requires constant maintenance and repair. For example Amazon’s 39 supposedly fully automated data centers in the United States and Ireland employed ten thousand workers to keep them humming. What is called “the cloud” or cyberspace is nothing more than an extended material complex of fiber-optic cables “People think that data is in the cloud but it’s not. It’s in the ocean.” Actually it’s also on and under the land as well as under the sea following paths originally laid in the mid-nineteenth century for telegraph cables. Today’s fiber-optic cables carry 95 percent of internet traffic. The whole connected material system and its parts are highly vulnerable and breaks or disruptions are frequent. The system is laid and repaired by workers on cable ships those in cable stations around the world workers employed by national telecom companies and those in the proliferating number of huge data centers that as James Bridle put it “generate vast amounts of waste heat and require corresponding quantities of cooling from acres of air conditioning systems.” require human labor to run. At every point in this seemingly immaterial movement of data and money there are workers of various kinds and differing skills without which there would be no motion. There is no digitalization without human manipulation. In a period of relatively low levels of capital investment countless billions have been poured into the extension and deepening of this infrastructure. Looking at a somewhat broader measure of infrastructure Price Waterhouse Coopers estimates that $1.7 trillion was invested by private sources in infrastructure from 2010 to 2017 in a sector in which government investment often plays the major role. harbors and canals dug or dredged As large as these new investments are they represent only the initial cost and labor input. As Akhil Gupta argues about the many new infrastructure projects around the world “As soon as the project is completed and officially declared to be open the “dead” labor involved in infrastructure requires the constant input of living labor over its entire functioning “life.” A major force of this infrastructure expansion has been Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative launched in 2013. This has funded a network of super highways rail lines (three from China to Europe) and airports that “spreads into the Pacific and deep into Africa” as well as the Middle East and Europe. By 2015 China had set aside $890 billion to spend on 900 projects. it was “focused on energy and transportation with an overall potential investment estimated at about $1.4 trillion—a scale never before seen ” according to analyst Daniel Yergin. Such ventures mean the employment of huge numbers of workers across the vast spaces of Central and South Asia who bring these projects to life and can shut them down as well. An Era of Rebellion: Class or Multitude? All of this has occurred in a period of economic turbulence and recurring crises a climate crisis that can no longer be ignored and most recently the COVID-19 pandemic. Each of these has contributed to one degree or another to a dramatic upsurge in social activism and mass mobilization in opposition to the status quo and mobilizations have resulted from economic change and distress sometimes exacerbated by war. But they have been political in that they were mostly directed at governments and the neoliberal policies and accompanying corruption that have inflicted pain on the majority of people across the globe. The international upsurge that began with the Arab Spring 2011 and continued and even accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 has been far too massive to be described in detail here. Rather I will try to analyze some of its major characteristics and the role of the working class in this general upsurge. According to an analysis of “civil unrest” in 2019 by the risk-assessment firm Versisk Maplecroft or almost a quarter of all nations saw major civil disruptions in 2019 alone. This count shows these protests sweeping every region of the world other than North America. it missed some important actions in North America the huge Black Lives Matter upsurge and the July mass street mobilizations and strikes in Puerto Rico. Adding to this “civil unrest” were new highly visible mass mobilizations and on-going demonstrations in 2020 in Belarus and Russia’s far east; mass strikes in Indonesia; as well as the Black Lives Matter upsurge across the United States and much of the world. Many of these mobilizations were started by students or activists of various class backgrounds so the question of just what role working-class people and organizations played in all of this “civil unrest” needs to be addressed. David McNally has analyzed “the return of the mass strike” in considerable detail. Looking at mass strikes since the 2008 recession Across the decade since the Great Recession we have witnessed a series of enormous general strikes (Guadeloupe and Martinique and many more) as well as strike waves that have helped to topple heads of state (Tunisia there have been mass strikes of various sizes around the world often linked to issues of social reproduction including the 2018-2019 teachers strikes in the United States. As McNally emphasizes the mass strike has also been adopted by the women’s movement notably in the International Women’s Strikes that swept 50 nations in 2017 and 2018 in the name of the “feminism of the 99 percent.” Some mass strikes have occurred in the midst of broader mobilizations in streets and squares across the world such as those in Hong Kong That working-class action has been at the center of the upsurge can be seen in a few general figures. The European Trade Union Institute calculates that between 2010 and 2018 there were 64 general strikes in the European Union almost half of them in Greece. looking at just 56 countries 000 work stoppages between 2010 and 2019 mostly in manufacturing. The ILO author notes the number of strikes “could be far greater than 44 694 strikes between 2015 and 2017 in a wide variety of industries. Lu Chunsen estimates 3 220 strikes by manufacturing workers in China from 2011 to May 2019 despite the precarious nature of work the mass internal migration to the cities and the government’s ban on strikes. Here we see a clear example of the merging of informal migrant workers with the formal workforce—and their subsequent actions. We know that unions played important roles in many of the recent struggles even where middle-class leaders put themselves in front of the masses. In Belarus an interview on the BBC with a union leader revealed he was one of the top leaders of the rebellion. Furthermore participants report that the demonstrations were “expanding into a wider working-class movement involving widespread workplace mobilizations.” In a detailed analysis of the Arab Spring Anand Gopal notes that while unionized workers played a key role of most Arab rebellions in the initial stages of the Syrian upsurge the fragmented working-class masses came first from the shanty towns and that “the movement’s rank and file consisted of precarious semi-employed workers who simply did not possess the structural power to threaten the Syrian elite.” much of the mass base of 2011 came from both the organized working class and the informal workers in most Arab countries would have been at one time or another drawn into the GVC of multinational capital working in the oil fields and in the many ports of the Middle East and North Africa. Gopal argues that their very precariousness and informal employment means they had little power. Yet such workers have organized themselves in their neighborhoods and through national trade unions as well as in workplaces to storm the streets and squares as workers have done for generations. The seemingly mixed-class appearance of many of the mass strikers and demonstrators was also a result of the “proletarianization” of educated people such as teachers and nurses whose jobs had been standardized and subjected to tighter management by the processes described above as well as the descent of many educated “millennials” into working-class jobs. Here the lines of class appear blurred but the social destiny of the majority of this generation and the next is clearly working class. Some of these show up in strikes of “platform” workers or delivery and other workers newly discovered as “essential” to social reproduction in the context of the pandemic which is likely to accelerate this social transformation. What seems clear is that whether or not students played an initiating role and middle-class professionals and politicians co-opted leadership roles the mass base of most rebellions of the last decade was working class in composition and that to a considerable extent they employed the traditional weapon of the mass strike. This was the case whether or not they were union members or held permanent employment much like the masses Rosa Luxemburg analyzed in the 1905 Russian Revolution whose strikes “display such a multiplicity of the most varied forms of action.” This whole period has been an example of working-class self-activity with both economic and political demands. nowhere did the strikes or mass mobilizations seek political power for the workers themselves or a program approaching socialism. Nowhere were the working class or mixed classes in transition organized for such goals. In some cases there did not appear to be recognizable leaders. Yet the participants were organized in “a multiplicity of the most varied forms of action” and organizations often through networks enabled by social media. The difficulty in analyzing the potential of this era of rebellion is compounded by the uncertain impact of the three crises of capitalism and in particular the effect of the pandemic on a variety of industries and the GVCs. Such speculation is for another article. The most useful understanding of the potential of the current upsurge is best described by McNally “The new strike movements are harbingers of a period of of militant working-class cultures of resistance the very soil out of which socialist politics can grow.” will help produce a general working-class upsurge is impossible to predict. But as United Electrical Workers representative Mark Meinster writes in “Working-class upsurges often happen in the context of deep social changes in society as a whole such as abrupt and widespread economic dislocation a profound loss of legitimacy by ruling elites That just about describes the situation labor faces across the world today.

The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands by it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Whether the independence of the continent was declared too soon I will not now enter into as an argument; my own simple opinion is that had it been eight months earlier it would have been much better. We did not make a proper use of last winter while we were in a dependent state. However was all our own [ we have none to blame but ourselves. But no great deal is lost yet. All that Howe has been doing for this month past is rather a ravage than a conquest which the spirit of the Jerseys and which time and a little resolution will soon recover. I have as little superstition in me as any man living but my secret opinion has ever been that God Almighty will not give up a people to military destruction or leave them unsupportedly to perish who have so earnestly and so repeatedly sought to avoid the calamities of war by every decent method which wisdom could invent. Neither have I so much of the infidel in me as to suppose that He has relinquished the government of the world and given us up to the care of devils; and as I do not I cannot see on what grounds the king of Britain can look up to heaven for help against us: a common murderer has as good a pretence as he. 'Tis surprising to see how rapidly a panic will sometimes run through a country. All nations and ages have been subject to them. Britain has trembled like an ague at the report of a French fleet of flat-bottomed boats; and in the fourteenth [fifteenth] century the whole English army after ravaging the kingdom of France was driven back like men petrified with fear; and this brave exploit was performed by a few broken forces collected and headed by a woman Joan of Arc. Would that heaven might inspire some Jersey maid to spirit up her countrymen and save her fair fellow sufferers from ravage and ravishment! Yet panics have their uses; they produce as much good as hurt. Their duration is always short; the mind soon grows through them and acquires a firmer habit than before. But their peculiar advantage is that they are the touchstones of sincerity and hypocrisy and bring things and men to light which might otherwise have lain forever undiscovered. In fact they have the same effect on secret traitors which an imaginary apparition would have upon a private murderer. They sift out the hidden thoughts of man and hold them up in public to the world. Many a disguised Tory has lately shown his head that shall penitentially solemnize with curses the day on which Howe arrived upon the Delaware. As I was with the troops at Fort Lee and marched with them to the edge of Pennsylvania I am well acquainted with many circumstances which those who live at a distance know but little or nothing of. Our situation there was exceedingly cramped the place being a narrow neck of land between the North River and the Hackensack. Our force was inconsiderable being not one-fourth so great as Howe could bring against us. We had no army at hand to have relieved the garrison had we shut ourselves up and stood on our defence. Our ammunition and the best part of our stores on the apprehension that Howe would endeavor to penetrate the Jerseys in which case Fort Lee could be of no use to us; for it must occur to every thinking man whether in the army or not that these kind of field forts are only for temporary purposes and last in use no longer than the enemy directs his force against the particular object which such forts are raised to defend. Such was our situation and condition at Fort Lee on the morning of the 20th of November when an officer arrived with information that the enemy with 200 boats had landed about seven miles above; Major General [Nathaniel] Green immediately ordered them under arms and sent express to General Washington at the town of Hackensack distant by the way of the ferry = six miles. Our first object was to secure the bridge over the Hackensack which laid up the river between the enemy and us about six miles from us and three from them. General Washington arrived in about three-quarters of an hour and marched at the head of the troops towards the bridge which place I expected we should have a brush for; however they did not choose to dispute it with us and the greatest part of our troops went over the bridge the rest over the ferry except some which passed at a mill on a small creek between the bridge and the ferry and made their way through some marshy grounds up to the town of Hackensack and there passed the river. We brought off as much baggage as the wagons could contain the rest was lost. The simple object was to bring off the garrison and march them on till they could be strengthened by the Jersey or Pennsylvania militia so as to be enabled to make a stand. We staid four days at Newark collected our out-posts with some of the Jersey militia and marched out twice to meet the enemy on being informed that they were advancing though our numbers were greatly inferior to theirs. Howe committed a great error in generalship in not throwing a body of forces off from Staten Island through Amboy by which means he might have seized all our stores at Brunswick and intercepted our march into Pennsylvania; but if we believe the power of hell to be limited we must likewise believe that their agents are under some providential control. I shall not now attempt to give all the particulars of our retreat to the Delaware; suffice it for the present to say that both officers and men though greatly harassed and fatigued the inevitable consequences of a long retreat bore it with a manly and martial spirit. All their wishes centred in one that the country would turn out and help them to drive the enemy back. Voltaire has remarked that King William never appeared to full advantage but in difficulties and in action; the same remark may be made on General Washington for the character fits him. There is a natural firmness in some minds which cannot be unlocked by trifles discovers a cabinet of fortitude; and I reckon it among those kind of public blessings which we do not immediately see that God hath blessed him with uninterrupted health and given him a mind that can even flourish upon care. I shall conclude this paper with some miscellaneous remarks on the state of our affairs; and shall begin with asking the following question Why is it that the enemy have left the New England provinces and made these middle ones the seat of war? The answer is easy: New England is not infested with Tories and we are. I have been tender in raising the cry against these men and used numberless arguments to show them their danger but it will not do to sacrifice a world either to their folly or their baseness. The period is now arrived in which either they or we must change our sentiments or one or both must fall. And what is a Tory? Good God! What is he? I should not be afraid to go with a hundred Whigs against a thousand Tories were they to attempt to get into arms. Every Tory is a coward; for servile self-interested fear is the foundation of Toryism; and a man under such influence though he may be cruel before the line of irrecoverable separation be drawn between us let us reason the matter together: Your conduct is an invitation to the enemy yet not one in a thousand of you has heart enough to join him. Howe is as much deceived by you as the American cause is injured by you. He expects you will all take up arms and flock to his standard with muskets on your shoulders. Your opinions are of no use to him unless you support him personally I once felt all that kind of anger which a man ought to feel against the mean principles that are held by the Tories: a noted one who kept a tavern at Amboy was standing at his door with as pretty a child in his hand about eight or nine years old and after speaking his mind as freely as he thought was prudent finished with this unfatherly expression ""Well! give me peace in my day."" Not a man lives on the continent but fully believes that a separation must some time or other finally take place and a generous parent should have said ""If there must be trouble let it be in my day that my child may have peace;"" and this single reflection is sufficient to awaken every man to duty. Not a place upon earth might be so happy as America. Her situation is remote from all the wrangling world and she has nothing to do but to trade with them. A man can distinguish himself between temper and principle and I am as confident as I am that God governs the world that America will never be happy till she gets clear of foreign dominion. Wars will break out till that period arrives and the continent must in the end be conqueror; for though the flame of liberty may sometimes cease to shine the coal can never expire. nor does not want force; but she wanted a proper application of that force. Wisdom is not the purchase of a day and it is no wonder that we should err at the first setting off. From an excess of tenderness we were unwilling to raise an army and trusted our cause to the temporary defence of a well-meaning militia. A summer's experience has now taught us better; yet with those troops we were able to set bounds to the progress of the enemy thank God! they are again assembling. I always considered militia as the best troops in the world for a sudden exertion but they will not do for a long campaign. Howe will make an attempt on this city [Philadelphia]; should he fail on this side the Delaware he is ruined. If he succeeds our cause is not ruined. He stakes all on his side against a part on ours; admitting he succeeds that armies from both ends of the continent will march to assist their suffering friends in the middle states; for he cannot go everywhere it is impossible. I consider Howe as the greatest enemy the Tories have; he is bringing a war into their country had it not been for him and partly for themselves they had been clear of. Should he now be expelled I wish with all the devotion of a Christian that the names of Whig and Tory may never more be mentioned; but should the Tories give him encouragement to come or assistance if he come I as sincerely wish that our next year's arms may expel them from the continent and the Congress appropriate their possessions to the relief of those who have suffered in well-doing. A single successful battle next year will settle the whole. America could carry on a two years' war by the confiscation of the property of disaffected persons and be made happy by their expulsion. Say not that this is revenge call it rather the soft resentment of a suffering people having no object in view but the good of all have staked their own all upon a seemingly doubtful event. Yet it is folly to argue against determined hardness; eloquence may strike the ear and the language of sorrow draw forth the tear of compassion but nothing can reach the heart that is steeled with prejudice. I turn with the warm ardor of a friend to those who have nobly stood and are yet determined to stand the matter out: I call not upon a few but upon all: not on this state or that state but on every state: up and help us; lay your shoulders to the wheel; better have too much force than too little when so great an object is at stake. Let it be told to the future world that in the depth of winter when nothing but hope and virtue could survive that the city and the country alarmed at one common danger came forth to meet and to repulse it. Say not that thousands are gone turn out your tens of thousands; throw not the burden of the day upon Providence but ""show your faith by your works "" that God may bless you. It matters not where you live or what rank of life you hold the evil or the blessing will reach you all. The far and the near the home counties and the back the rich and the poor will suffer or rejoice alike. The heart that feels not now is dead; the blood of his children will curse his cowardice who shrinks back at a time when a little might have saved the whole and made them happy. I love the man that can smile in trouble that can gather strength from distress and grow brave by reflection. 'Tis the business of little minds to shrink; but he whose heart is firm and whose conscience approves his conduct will pursue his principles unto death. My own line of reasoning is to myself as straight and clear as a ray of light. Not all the treasures of the world so far as I believe could have induced me to support an offensive war for I think it murder; but if a thief breaks into my house burns and destroys my property and kills or threatens to kill me or those that are in it and to ""bind me in all cases whatsoever"" to his absolute will am I to suffer it? What signifies it to me whether he who does it is a king or a common man; my countryman or not my countryman; whether it be done by an individual villain or an army of them? If we reason to the root of things we shall find no difference; neither can any just cause be assigned why we should punish in the one case and pardon in the other. Let them call me rebel and welcome I feel no concern from it; but I should suffer the misery of devils were I to make a whore of my soul by swearing allegiance to one whose character is that of a sottish brutish man. I conceive likewise a horrid idea in receiving mercy from a being who at the last day shall be shrieking to the rocks and mountains to cover him and fleeing with terror from the orphan and the slain of America. There are cases which cannot be overdone by language and this is one. There are persons who see not the full extent of the evil which threatens them; they solace themselves with hopes that the enemy will be merciful. It is the madness of folly to expect mercy from those who have refused to do justice; and even mercy where conquest is the object is only a trick of war; the cunning of the fox is as murderous as the violence of the wolf and we ought to guard equally against both. Howe's first object is partly by threats and partly by promises to terrify or seduce the people to deliver up their arms and receive mercy. The ministry recommended the same plan to Gage and this is what the tories call making their peace ""a peace which passeth all understanding"" indeed! A peace which would be the immediate forerunner of a worse ruin than any we have yet thought of. Ye men of Pennsylvania do reason upon these things! Were the back counties to give up their arms they would fall an easy prey to the Indians who are all armed: this perhaps is what some Tories would not be sorry for. Were the home counties to deliver up their arms they would be exposed to the resentment of the back counties who would then have it in their power to chastise their defection at pleasure. And were any one state to give up its arms that state must be garrisoned by all Howe's army of Britons and Hessians to preserve it from the anger of the rest. Mutual fear is the principal link in the chain of mutual love and woe be to that state that breaks the compact. Howe is mercifully inviting you to barbarous destruction and men must be either rogues or fools that will not see it. I dwell not upon the vapors of imagination; I bring reason to your ears in language as plain as A hold up truth to your eyes. that I fear not. I see no real cause for fear. I know our situation well and can see the way out of it. While our army was collected Howe dared not risk a battle; and it is no credit to him that he decamped from the White Plains and waited a mean opportunity to ravage the defenceless Jerseys; but it is great credit to us with a handful of men we sustained an orderly retreat for near an hundred miles the greatest part of our stores and had four rivers to pass. None can say that our retreat was precipitate for we were near three weeks in performing it that the country might have time to come in. Twice we marched back to meet the enemy and remained out till dark. The sign of fear was not seen in our camp and had not some of the cowardly and disaffected inhabitants spread false alarms through the country the Jerseys had never been ravaged. Once more we are again collected and collecting; our new army at both ends of the continent is recruiting fast and we shall be able to open the next campaign with sixty thousand men well armed and clothed. This is our situation and who will may know it. By perseverance and fortitude we have the prospect of a glorious issue; by cowardice and submission the sad choice of a variety of evils - a ravaged country - a depopulated city - habitations without safety and slavery without hope - our homes turned into barracks and bawdy-houses for Hessians and a future race to provide for whose fathers we shall doubt of. Look on this picture and weep over it! and if there yet remains one thoughtless wretch who believes it not let him suffer it unlamented. The present winter is worth an age the whole continent will partake of the evil; and there is no punishment that man does not deserve that may be the means of sacrificing a season so precious and useful.

1620763987.732759,88141778,https://hbr.org/2021/05/black-women-start-more-businesses-than-white-men,But their ventures are less likely to succeed. New research looks at why. Despite starting businesses at a high rate 3% of Black women are running mature businesses. In contrast white women are more than twice as likely to be mature business owners (7%) despite starting at lower rates. This disparity between high startup and low established business activity among Black women suggests potential issues with sustaining a business. Enabling access to entrepreneurship for all groups in society benefits all of us by creating employment opportunities and bringing a diversity of ideas into fruition. an astounding 17% of Black women are in the process of starting or running new businesses. That’s compared to just 10% of white women and 15% of white men. only 3% of Black women are running mature businesses. To understand why this steep drop off occurs and how to combat it we analyzed data from interviews with more than 12 700 of whom identified as entrepreneurs and nearly 1 200 of whom own established businesses. The research was part of our work with the an annual comprehensive survey of entrepreneurship rates and attributes conducted in more than 120 economies since 1999. The large-scale survey is administered by academic research teams in each economy; we represent the U.S. team. Our analysis offers several possible reasons Black women entrepreneurs struggle to sustain their businesses. One explanation may be the types of businesses started: Our analysis shows that 61% of Black women entrepreneurs start businesses in either retail/wholesale or the health government or social services sectors compared to the 47% of white women and 32% of white men entrepreneurs. To the extent that these are small informal businesses with low margins in crowded competitive contexts they are more difficult to sustain over the long term. Another possible explanation is access to capital influence what types of businesses Black women open. In previous research we found that their total start-up capital. This is in spite of the fact that in our analysis of the only 29% of Black women entrepreneurs live in households with incomes over $75 compared to 52% of white men. This result along with data showing that Black people take on a higher and are less likely to suggest that educated Black women are encumbered with debt and have fewer personal resources and low collateral. access to key resources needed for entrepreneurship are unevenly distributed in U.S. society reinforcing the advantage of certain groups while impeding the entry and catching-up of disadvantaged groups. This only reinforces a cycle where resource limitations reduce one’s ability to generate financial gains from entrepreneurship. Combating racial and gender disparities is a long-term proposition in the U.S. but there are immediate efforts that can help accelerate this change and provide near-term benefits. The finance community needs to look beyond aiding a disadvantaged group to recognizing both the biases they bring to investment assessment and the benefit of businesses run by educated Black women in sectors that can benefit from new ideas and social impact. This may require educating the finance sector improving finance practices and setting guidelines to ensure equity in funding entrepreneurs. For example financial institutions could examine whether the criteria and procedures to invest or loan money are the same for all groups suggests that different demographic groups are asked different types of questions during the funding process. Our research also showed that Black women starting businesses in the U.S. are highly educated. Although slightly more than in the general population have a college degree or higher level of education we found that more than three-fourths of Black women entrepreneurs have at least a college degree. Universities are uniquely positioned then to provide Black women with experiential education practices that enable them to learn and practice entrepreneurship and develop capabilities for overcoming constraints they may face as well as offer peer support and collaboration in addition to expert advising. Black women are positioned to play an increasingly visible and important role in the United States’ political and economic future particularly with the election of the first Black woman vice president and the widespread call for change embodied in the Movement for Black Lives. Never before have we seen such potential for Black women to elevate their voice and their careers and to achieve social and economic equality. One means for realizing this dream lies in the opportunities offered through entrepreneurship. However this dream will not be complete without targeted efforts that enable Black women entrepreneurs to grow and sustain their businesses. This will require conscious efforts by the government and private sector to uncover and address gaps and biases in entrepreneurial ecosystems in a way that provides inclusivity and support for the diversity of entrepreneurs that bring economic and social value to American society. is a Professor of Entrepreneurship at Babson College and holds the Frederic C.

On second thought 2021 will also initiate an unwelcome restoration of legitimacy to Western imperialism akin to Barack Obama’s rule. Biden’s (2020) recent article began by stressing how since 2017 “the international system that the United States so carefully constructed is coming apart at the seams.” In reconstructing imperialism Biden may draw upon a legislative and public-advocacy record dating to the 1980s based upon consistent service to several internationally ambitious circuits of U.S. capital: for example through supporting bankruptcy “reform the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act deregulating Wall Street when promoting trade and “investor rights” deals; when favoring intellectual property and opposing public financing of health care; given that his climate policy will resurrect Obama’s based on insufficient emissions reductions ongoing oil and gas drilling and pipeline transport a refusal to pay the U.S. climate debt and renewed reliance upon carbon markets; and for Biden supported every war since the 1980s leading the authoritative insider journal “Biden may not radically change the nation’s military deviate from the era’s so-called great power competition or even slash the bottom line of the Pentagon’s $700 billion budget” (Benjamin and Davies 2020). What will stand in opposition to a Biden-administration imperialism whose toxic ideology only replaces Trump’s “paleoconservative” nationalism with the Obama-style fusion of neoliberalism and neoconservatism? Much hope was invested in the Latin American “Pink Tide” but it faded after Hugo Chavez’s 2013 death (with Venezuela’s subsequent Maduro government surviving but suffering enormously from U.S. sanctions whereas Bolivia’s Movement Towards Socialism returned to power in 2020 after a coup backed by Trump and lithium-dependent battery producer Elon Musk). Since then the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (BRICS) network has been of central interest in twenty-first-century international political economy. This group of countries from the Global South (and East) gathered momentum after Goldman Sachs banker Jim O’Neill initially conceived the acronym BRIC in 2001 (not including South Africa) in order to identify promising markets. However it was the U.S.-catalyzed financial meltdown in 2008 that gave the BRIC states more credibility as “rising powers.” “Core” countries were losing political-economic power on the world stage along with other so-called “emerging economies ” would challenge the dominant position of the United States That economic crash also consolidated the G20 assimilating all five BRIC nations into the reflation of the global economy based initially upon both an unprecedented infrastructure build-out in China and Western central bank quantitative easing plus International Monetary Fund (IMF) funding. In 2009 the first BRIC summit took place in Russia starting a succession of annual summits that gave body and content to the group. China invited South Africa to join in late 2010. Despite annual displays of cooperation through leadership summits and hundreds of side meetings there are still significant asymmetries between these five countries and South Africa are highly dependent on commodities exports with China a major buyer. In turn exports from China to other BRICS nations are made up of manufactured and semi-manufactured products creating major trade and financial deficits. A form of the classic North-South manufacturing-commodity function within the international division of labor appears to be reinforced by trade relations among the bloc’s members. If such a tendency can arise inside the bloc BRICS countries’ foreign direct investment (FDI) and credit are even more pernicious in the Global South we question whether BRICS is capable of reversing historical unequal relations of trade and investment between the “core” and “peripheries an uncomfortable middle ground: “sub-imperialism.” We conclude that BRICS will therefore fail to promote new development practices that could lead to a more environmentally sustainable and socially just model. To the contrary BRICS nations appear to be reinforcing old patterns of underdevelopment that amplify extraction of natural resources which in turn results in adverse impacts for local communities and nature. Although the COVID-19 crisis interrupted many aspects of global capitalism these features appear more durable. Despite a potentially constructive geopolitical role that can be played by BRICS members (particularly China) in terms of balancing U.S. hegemony and providing competition to the Western corporations that have dominated FDI in the Global South BRICS firms’ presence there suggests the earlier expectations were overly optimistic. From the standpoint of individual peripheral countries the current role being played by BRICS is a force of continuity and legitimator of the global capitalist power structure rather than one of change. BRICS and Competing Theories of Development Among diverse analyses of BRICS over the past decade leading geopolitical analyst Radhika Desai (2013) was perhaps most enthusiastic: “Not since the Non-Aligned Movement and the demand for a New Economic Order in the 1970s has the world seen such a coordinated challenge to Western supremacy in the world economy from developing countries.” Some analysts even expressed hope for a “new Bandung” in the twenty-first century referring to a 1955 conference of 29 African and Asian countries that created the Non-Aligned Movement of 120 states (Bisio 2015 the BRICS countries were beneficiaries of a corporate-driven globalization “owing their rise to the marriage of global capital and cheap labor” in export-oriented manufacturing and extractive sectors. Kees van der Pijl (2017) even considered the BRICS nations as contender regimes in the form of state-oligarchic rivals to the liberal West. Some BRICS leaders have endorsed such a view in order to score political points with domestic constituencies. Most crudely former South African President Jacob Zuma claimed repeatedly “I was poisoned and almost died just because South Africa joined BRICS under my leadership” (Matiwane 2017). According to Brazil’s former Foreign Minister Celso Amorim “BRICS corresponded with the rearrangement of global economic forces especially after the 2008 financial crisis and became notorious thanks to the redistribution of decision-making power within the IMF in favor of its members” (Amorim and Feldman 2011: 286). it is important to ask whether greater voting power within the IMF marked BRICS as a progressive force or instead as an of the Global North. European neoliberal leadership and ongoing commitments to the Washington consensus menu of pro-corporate economic policy prevailed at the IMF after 2015 when four BRICS members achieved much greater influence following voting-weight restructuring (only South Africa’s share dropped). This should not have been a surprise for as Ray Kiely (2015: 2-3) argued BRICS’ rise “owes less to state capitalist deviations from neoliberal prescriptions [that] originated in the West and more to the embrace of globalization friendly policies.” Vijay Prashad (2013:3) termed the BRICS agenda “neoliberalism with Southern characteristics. … There is no frontal challenge to Northern institutional hegemony or to the neoliberal policy framework. BRICS attempt by the Southern powerhouses to earn themselves what they see as their rightful place on the world stage.” But there is an even more critical characterization: the BRICS nations as “sub-imperial” powers featuring the super-exploitation of their working classes predatory relations regarding their hinterlands and collaboration (although tensioned) with imperialism especially as intermediaries in the transfer of both surplus labor values and “free gifts of nature” (unequal ecological exchange) from South to North. BRICS members’ role in multilateral governance is not anti-imperialist as sometimes advertised but instead consistent with what Immanuel Wallerstein called the “semi-peripheral” economies’ aspirations to follow Western expansionary precedents using instruments of (corporate-oriented) multilateral power. new centers of capital overaccumulation need spatio-temporal fixes for their own surpluses that could not be as profitably invested at home. China’s industrial overcapacity crisis is most obvious but this condition extends to both imperialist and sub-imperialist practices “dispersed through an uneven geography of capital surplus distribution” (Harvey 2007). In a recent debate over the character of contemporary imperialism Harvey (2018) remarked how mineral and agricultural commodity chains and land grabs that follow BRICS firms’ expansions—especially Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative—are “wrecking the landscape all around the world.” A rigid and fixed concept of “North-South imperialism” can’t account for ever more complex “spatial and space-specific forms of production and circulation” of surplus capital overaccumulated in middle-tier economies Harvey (2018) insists. This is not an abandonment of Rosa Luxemburg’s (1968) 1913 theory of imperialism but an adaptation for new circumstances. influential Latin American and African theories of underdevelopment deserve revisiting. At the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) Argentine diplomat Raúl Prebisch formulated a non-Western view of development economics taking his insights to the UN Conference on Development and Trade which in the 1970s was the launchpad for the New International Economic Order proposals (Letelier and Moffit 1977). Prebisch used the core-periphery model to challenge Ricardian notions of comparative advantage and to promote policies that were attractive to trade unions and patriotic businesses and policy-makers. By condemning poor countries’ specialization in exporting raw materials—which in turn led to declining terms of trade—Prebisch (1950 10) showed how “fruits of technical progress” were disproportionately enjoyed by industrialized economies and societies. the most advanced first-generation liberation movement leaders (such as Kwame Nkrumah and Samora Machel) agreed that neocolonial economic relations needed to be broken resulting in the 1979 Lagos Plan of Action adopted by the Organization of African Unity (but rapidly sabotaged by the Bretton Woods Institutions; Bond 2006). The Egyptian political economist Samir Amin (1990) contributed a theory and program of strategic “delinking.” the next generation of Dependency School perspectives drew on the core-periphery model but also explained “limits of industrialization” in the South—which Prebisch (1950: 6) himself had already warned of. The emerging critique was not restricted to trade relations alone but included a whole “structure of dependence ” as argued by Theotônio dos Santos (1970). Contrary to the dominant modernization theories especially U.S. State Department strategist Walt Rostow’s (1960) “stages of economic growth 235) insisted that “to analyze backwardness as a failure to assimilate more advanced modes of production or to modernize is nothing more than ideology disguised as science.” Within the Marxist strand of dependency theories Ruy Mauro Marini (1965; 1972) explained how Southern elites engaged in a so-called “antagonistic cooperation” (Marini 1965: 12) with capitalist centers of accumulation. He added that the “super-exploitation of labor” was retained under dependency due to the need to extract super-profits enough to satisfy both the revenue expectations of international capitalists and the share that corresponds to their minor associates in the periphery and semi-periphery (Marini 1972 23). One possible outcome was the evolution toward what Marini (1972 the form which dependent capitalism assumes upon reaching the stage of monopolies and finance capital Watching the debate unfold from Senegal 22) agreed that Marini’s theory “addresses a very real problem raised here: that of inequality in peripheral development.” If light industry arises in sub-imperial economies (including in Africa) it means “producing not only for their ‘national’ market but also for those of neighboring areas.” In the intervening period the most destructive circuits of international capital were amplified suffocating all but a few Global South break-out spaces (especially the newly industrializing countries of East Asia) several of which became more actively sub-imperial as a transmission belt to the world economy suffocating their own neighbors in the process. dependency theories were able to show that neither industrialization to the level of monopolies nor high levels of economic growth by themselves would automatically reverse the trend toward underdevelopment or to a very distorted kind of development one that crystalizes inequalities instead of mitigating them. “Brazilian capitalism is a monster “but a logical monster.” He explained the coexistence of advanced technology and a sizable luxury goods market alongside the vast majority’s misery. Import-substitution industrialization strategies in postwar Brazil and South Africa were biased toward supplying Western-quality consumer goods to a small market within the context of the world’s worst inequality (Nixson 1982). Unlike the traditions of ECLAC or dependency theory which took the desirability of development for granted a recent movement encompassing both academic and activist worlds aims to abandon modernizing ambitions in favor of a different (Living Well) concept articulated by indigenous peoples from the Andean region. Although it constitutes a plural movement this post-developmentalist critique has been gaining momentum in the past two decades mainly due to the attention given to resistance by local communities against infrastructure megaprojects threatening their livelihoods and the surrounding environments (Gudynas 2013 Aníbal Quijano (1992) introduced the concept of “coloniality of power ” since development had become a “ghost” haunting elite consciences in most Latin American capitals preventing the return of normative ideals able to inspire their own societies (Quijano 2012 77). If the notion of development cannot escape its Eurocentric roots then it is mandatory to formulate an “alternative mode of existence as the de/ coloniality of power” (Quijano 2012: 42) . The same is true in many African societies where some advocate a return to “ ” mutual aid systems as well as societal reintegration within local ecologies—instead of ongoing fruitless efforts at modernization (Terreblanche 2018). Firmly Within—Not Against—the Capitalist World Order This reminder of the big-picture development debates compels us to critique the BRICS nations’ role: Instead of being supportive of alternative approaches their economic relationship to the rest of the Global South the traditional international division of labor through FDI and credit in projects directed to the extraction of natural resources (oil and infrastructure related to them. Some might term this process the dependency-inducing neocolonialism combines capitalist and non-capitalist relations as Luxemburg (1968) argued. In today’s “post-colonial” world there are equally extreme forms in many sites where BRICS-based firms and geopoliticians are the main actors. China is the world’s largest economy (measured in purchasing power parity) and the main power within BRICS. Chinese foreign investment went through different phases: In the 1990s and early 2000s it was characterized by large state-owned enterprises’ acquisitions focused on natural resources especially energy and mining. After the 2008-2009 Western financial meltdown reinforced rising Chinese power BRICS surfaced amidst the growing presence of the country’s private multinationals including increased investments in extractive industries but also technology China’s Belt and Road Initiative has gone beyond Asia and Europe and has included 40 countries in Africa and 18 in Latin America. It offers recipients major infrastructure projects and credit lines (Zhang 2019; Dollar reproduced capitalism’s traditional core-periphery dichotomy: While investments in Latin America and Africa are concentrated in energy investments in the United States and Europe are directed to services and high-level manufacturing (Jaguaribe 2018: 22-23). China leads the BRICS nations’ presence in Africa. The Asian giant is now the continent’s biggest trade partner and one of its main investors. China is also the largest source of demand for African exports. On the one hand almost all capital from China to Africa represented “international aid.” On the other a flood of cheap Chinese exports was devastating to Africa’s small manufacturing sector and other sectors in South Africa and other countries that had earlier attempted import-substitution industrialization. Most of Africa witnessed a halving of manufacturing output relative to gross domestic product during the 1990s-2000s. there was more FDI from China and in the following dozen years the stock of Chinese investment in Africa soared from $491 million to $32.4 billion (He and Zhu 2018 during the world financial crisis the largest single acquisition in Africa was the $5.6 billion purchase by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China of a 20 percent share in Standard Bank of South Africa. The China Development Bank made two other large South African loan commitments initially reported at $5 billion each: to the parastatal Transnet in 2013 to buy Chinese locomotives mainly so as to export coal and to the energy parastatal Eskom in 2016 for a coal-fired power plant. Both were bound up in corruption scandals the first involving payoffs to the infamous Gupta brothers who “state-captured” the Zuma government and the second paying for Hitachi boilers after the Japanese firm had given the ruling party a 25 percent share of its local branch (Bond 2020). Chinese loans totaled $141 billion (80 percent of which were made by the China Development Bank) from 2005-2016 $74 billion were secured through “loan-for-oil” collateral and many denominated in renminbi not dollars (CEPAL 2018 23-24). The danger is a new form of financial dependency in which China—whose currency strengthened more than nearly any other (making the loans much more expensive to repay)—is progressively more attached to the region’s economies. But this amplifies the more general mode of dependency as 72 percent of Latin American exports to China in 2016 were primary commodities. (For the rest of the world primary commodities accounted for only 27 percent of the region’s exports and high-tech manufactures [CEPAL 2018 Chinese firms are increasingly replacing Western extractive corporations that had mastered “unequal ecological exchange ” another major problem with such asymmetrical trade. The term’s use in this instance refers to the uncompensated depletion of nonrenewable raw materials this process leads to a $150 billion annual wealth outflow of which a great deal is to China (Bond 2018). Dussel Peters (2019) estimates that from 2000-18 there were 402 major Chinese investments in Latin America and the Caribbean totaling $8.203 billion mainly through mergers and acquisitions within the raw materials and service sectors. Brazil received most of these investments (ten out of the top dozen) directed mainly to the energy sector China has largely protected its multinational corporations through 128 bilateral investment treaties (BITs) around the world (the second largest number behind Germany). Since the 1990s it has signed 34 BITs in Africa and 15 BITs in Latin America and the Caribbean in addition to bilateral free trade agreements with Costa Rica There are important contrasts between China and other BRICS countries for while the former captured large market shares at the world scale and moved up within global value chains other countries’ investments are linked more to their own regional value chains and infrastructure networks (UNCTAD 2017 55). Indian annual FDI abroad peaked at $21 billion in 2008 (with lower rates since) and is mainly focused on natural resources and services. Two of its most aggressive entrepreneurs Lakshmi Mittal of ArcelorMittal steel and Anil Agarwal of Vedanta mining have played extremely controversial roles in South Africa and Zambia respectively (van der Merwe et al 2019). To protect the value of (and income stream from) its FDI 12 of which are with African countries and another four with Latin America. India has also increased its role in aid and improved cultural relations (Bhatia the India-Africa Forum Summit allowed the New Delhi government to begin consultations with African heads of state every few years; the 2015 conference attracted 29 leaders. Diplomatic together with the substantial Indian diaspora in Africa have also helped attract Indian investments (Cheru and Obi 2011: 99-100). Indian FDI is generally low but has grown in the last years through mergers and acquisitions in oil and gas 56-57; Paul 2012). Trade relations remain uneven with Africa and Latin America still mainly exporting raw materials while India supplies them pharmaceuticals and low- and medium-technology products (Anwar 2014; CEPAL 2016 Indian public and private corporations bought large chunks of land during the early 2010s land grabs causing conflict with residents (Cheru and Ob South Africa is the continent’s largest industrial power and invests prolifically elsewhere in Africa and construction. Some investments date to apartheid when mining houses such as Anglo American and a Johannesburg predecessor of BHP Billiton (Gencor) established major operations in newly independent Zimbabwe and Mozambique (Amisi et. al. 2015). These three firms relocated away from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (to London and Melbourne) as democracy dawned during the 1990s. Others moved up-continent including retail leader Shoprite (co-owned by Chinese capital; Carmody 2015) a company known for shutting down local supply chains so as to import their own South African goods—as simple as tomatoes—to their new shops in countries as far away as Zambia (Miller 2005). Russian firms in Latin America and Africa specialize in natural resources and related infrastructure (Barka and Mlambo 2011). Despite economic restrictions imposed by Western powers after the 2014 Crimea crisis increasingly modernized investments are offered in technology industries and even space exploration. In steel the firm Evraz—owned by Roman Abramovich (also owner of Britain’s Chelsea soccer club)—was soon notorious for buying and then in 2016 closing South Africa’s second largest steel company. A privatization program during 2017-2019 meant Moscow sold shares in its large multinationals including those active in Africa and Latin America such as VTB Bank (quickly implicated in a major Mozambican foreign-debt fraud case) the world’s leading diamond mining corporation Alrosa and the oil company Rosneft (UNCTAD 2017 Nuclear energy firm Rosatom continues to promise competitively priced technology to several countries (although the fraud associated with its South African associates Jacob Zuma and the Gupta brothers halted that process in 2017). Although sanctions shut Moscow out of World Bank credits Vladimir Putin did nevertheless sign the Washington Convention to access the bank’s investor-to-state arbitration panel where it has filed more than twenty cases to protect its 79 BITs and six investment agreements (including 11 in Africa and six in Latin America and the Caribbean). Russia’s engagement with Africa dates to Soviet support for national liberation movements and diverse diplomatic relations have continued (Arkhangelskaya and Shubin 2013 Putin hosted the first Russia-Africa Summit co-sponsored with Egypt’s military coup leader (and then elected president) Abdel Fatah el-Sisi. apart from historical relations with Cuba Russia renewed ties with Venezuela and Bolivia (with the latter even signing a $300 million Rosatom reactor contract). Russia’s arms deals in Africa were worth nearly $67 billion in 2011 (Amisi et. al. 2015) and $14 billion in Latin America in 2013 (Ellis 2015: 14). In early 2020 Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov visited Venezuela in order to help Caracas “deal with growing U.S. pressure ” just a year after Brazil’s right-wing foreign minister had unsuccessfully attempted to draw BRICS into a pro-coup diplomatic stance. Moscow’s economic relations with Europe and China resemble those of a peripheral country but when it deals with Africa and Latin America Russia has characteristics of a “core” capitalist country Brazil is the main FDI recipient in Latin America but also a major investor on the continent. During Lula da Silva’s Workers Party government from 2003 to 2010 the orientation was to “South-South relations ” which in turn set the stage for Brazil’s more proactive position in multilateral arenas. The right-wing Congress’ unjustified 2016 ousting of Lula’s successor and the subsequent rise of far-right Jair Bolsonaro to power in early 2019 caused chaos in Brazilian foreign policy especially Bolsonaro’s realignment with Washington at the expense of hard-fought-for pro-South diplomatic and economic ties. Brasilia has an ambiguous position toward Beijing since Bolsonaro’s allies in export corporations (especially agri-business) need the Chinese market while the president has exhibited Trump-style Sinophobia. When investing abroad Brazilian multinationals focus on the extractive minerals and energy sectors and beverages (FDC 2017). The Brazilian National Development Bank was the main source of funding for the internationalization of Brazilian corporations but Bolsonaro’s ultraliberal policies reduced its influence. Brasilia has adopted its own version of a BIT the Agreement on Cooperation and Facilitation of Investments. Unlike BITs ACFI doesn’t provide for “investor-to-state” arbitration in conflicts with other states or affected communities (Morosini and Ratton 2015). The Workers Party of Lula and Dilma always emphasized negotiated solutions with host states in which conflicts were kept out of the spotlight even though in the cases of Vale mining corruption and socio-ecological conflict often proved overwhelming. The people of Peru grew impatient and Odebrecht’s bribery of its leaders caused a severe backlash when three of the last four presidents were implicated in taking bribes: Two resigned (Alejandro Toledo and Pedro Pablo Kuczynski) and another committed suicide (Alan Garcia). The rise and fall of the BRICS nations seen from Latin America and Africa can be interpreted drawing upon these regions’ radical intellectual traditions in search of counter-hegemonic knowledge that contributes to structural change in local and global economic affairs. Apart from reproducing core-periphery and dependency relations the rise of BRICS reinforced the deeply rooted imagery of “modernization” and “development” in an epoch when such projects were being challenged by non-Western scholarship as well as by social movements and adversely affected communities of the South. The “talk left walk right” problem (Bond 2004) was interpreted by Sam Moyo (along with Amin one of Africa’s great political economists) when writing with Brazil-based Paris Yeros in 2011 (20) that the BRICS nations’ political “schizophrenia” was “typical of subimperialism’ (Yeros and Moyo 2011 While demanding reforms in the Bretton Woods multilateral institutions the BRICS countries also created their own financial institution in 2014: the BRICS New Development Bank. But it too appears to operate much the same as a Western multilateral bank (Bond 2020). In short existing financial institutions and multinational corporations by virtue of their own assimilation into global capital accumulation patterns. two obvious rightward political shifts—the Modi (2014) and Bolsonaro (2019) governments—created extreme geopolitical tension and curtailed the rise of BRICS and the present Sino-Indian border conflict festered in 2020 to the point that dozens of troops were killed in hand-to-hand combat. The geopolitical terrain may be fluid but in terms of African and Latin American economies it appears incontrovertible that BRICS firms’ and leaders’ relations tend to deepen the central features of the world capitalist economy hitherto dominated by the West. To be sure the COVID-19 crisis introduces major complications especially when it comes to managing social conflicts and health systems (for instance pharmaceutical markets and research). Inequities are so profound that residents of all the BRICS nations aside from China were incapable of defending their very lives against state incompetence. beyond merely fighting back against current economic dynamics progressive activists within the BRICS countries have a profound challenge: better organizing the counter-hegemonic social forces that have potential on the ground while at the same time exploring the viability of alternative modes of living that protect local communities and workers from megaprojects carried out by home-based parastatal corporations and private conglomerates (Bond and Garcia 2015). multinational corporations from BRICS countries as well as projects financed by BRICS institutions are reinforcing accumulation patterns that are socially and environmentally predatory destroying the forms of life and work of populations in their territories. In order to overcome this predicament South-South relations must be built with profound respect for counter-hegemonic social forces in these countries as well as at the global scale. The legacy of Latin American and African development theories demonstrates some of the ways of connecting economic theorizing to such concrete political struggles. Samir (1974).

1620764019.8453429,82415202,https://newpol.org/issue_post/authoritarianism-and-resistance-in-india/,"The Fight Against Modi and Hindutva in the Era of COVID-19 Editor’s note: New Politics board member Phil Gasper interviewed Samantha Agarwal in April 2020. The interview was subsequently transcribed and edited for length. : You have recently returned from India. You were there during the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and you left a few days before the recent lockdown was put in place. Can you tell us about some of these recent events that have defined Indian politics on a national scale for some time now? : I flew out from Bombay (Mumbai) on one of the last commercial flights before India’s borders were sealed. I was surprised to see that in Bombay the epicenter of the pandemic in India the government was not taking any perceptible public safety or social distancing measures while I was there. In fact right in the neighborhood where I was putting up there were blowout wedding parties happening almost every night with thousands of people attending. Then at the end of March after two months of almost no federally coordinated response to the pandemic Prime Minister Narendra Modi suddenly announced a 21-day lockdown which entailed closing subnational state borders and suspending all public transportation. And all of this was with less than four-hours’ notice! this move has exacerbated the gross inequalities that are characteristic of liberalized India. In India’s 1.3 billion population 800 million people live on less than $2 a day and at least 81 percent of the labor force is in the informal sector. Most of these workers are unorganized and they have very few rights and legal protections. whose wealth equals the nation’s annual operating budget. When the news of the lockdown reached this latter section wealthy India went out in droves and started hoarding wine and chocolate and other luxury commodities to nurse their quarantine anxieties. what happens to the common person? For example what happens to the millions of internal migrants who work for short periods of time while living in temporary settlements or tents that provide them little protection from the elements? How are you supposed to “shelter in place” if you don’t have shelter in the first place? Their first instinct was to go home—it’s a human-enough instinct to want to be in the company of your family during a time of a crisis. But the government made no plan to get these people home. in the absence of public transportation there were hundreds of people who began walking home sometimes up to 400 kilometers. Some of them were too late to reach the state border and were turned back. Many of these people are now being housed in dilapidated shelters in towns where they lack necessary social networks. in some cities there were reports of hundreds of people being stranded at train stations—at the Howrah Train Station in Calcutta (Kolkata) migrants were forced to share a single outdoor latrine for multiple days on end. People were literally being crippled by hunger and defecating on themselves. There were other reports of people being hit by cars or run over by trains in their perilous journeys home. The whole situation is devastating. Most likely Modi and his Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) will make it out of this moment without much loss to their popularity who literally create the wealth of the nation are invisible to the public imagination. One can only hope that this crisis which has brought international attention to their plight will be an impetus for some change. : What about the recent protests against the CAA and the National Register of Citizens? What role have they played and how have they been affected by the lockdown? : The BJP’s passage of the NRC and the CAA can be seen as one defining moment in the longer arc of Hindu majoritarian consolidation. The larger motivation behind these two laws is to deem India’s Muslims foreigners and to bring India a step closer to becoming a Hindu-only nation. The notion of India as a Hindu nation (or Hindutva ) has been one of the main ideological planks of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) the paramilitary-cultural organization that is also the parent organization to the BJP. the government plans to carry out a massive exercise on a national level to determine who is a legal resident and who is not through a National Register of Citizens the NRC. It would be similar to the NRC that has already been rolled out in the northeastern state of Assam where nearly two million people were essentially left stateless. Now these people are being asked to appeal to so-called “Foreigner’s Tribunals.” But if you lose your appeal you can be sent to a detention center—and these detention centers are now cropping up all over the country. While the process of the NRC on the national level will look somewhat different than in Assam because Assam has a distinct set of regional and ethnic forces the commonality will be the fact that the people who are most affected will be those who are poor and those who lack citizenship documentation for a variety of reasons. A recent study showed that only about 62 percent of India’s population even has a birth certificate and among the older generations the numbers would be even lower. And the government knows that Muslims will be disproportionately affected in this situation because next to Dalits (members of the former “untouchable” caste) Muslims are the poorest and the most marginalized social group in Indian society. in contrast to the NRC is aimed at giving citizenship “back” to people based on religion. It grants refuge to six religious communities while conspicuously excluding Muslims. According to the government’s claim the act is meant to protect persecuted religious minorities in those three countries that I named. But if that’s the case then why does the act not include the Ahmadiyyas or the Hazara Muslims who are not even considered Muslims in their own countries and whose rights are continuously violated? Why doesn’t it include oppressed populations in other neighboring countries like the Tamils in Sri Lanka or the Rohingya Muslims of Burma (Myanmar)? The rhetorical defense that I’ve heard from members of the BJP is that Muslims “have Pakistan and the Middle East ” and the non-Muslims in those countries should therefore be taken in by India. You can only buy this logic if you believe that Muslims are fundamentally oppressors that there are no ethnic or class divisions in “Muslim society ” and that India is a Hindu state. It’s this last part that is in direct contravention of the Constitution which says clearly that the Republic of India is a secular nation and will not discriminate against anyone on the basis of religion. It’s a kind of coup against the Constitution that’s happening under Modi. The upshot of the CAA and the NRC is the unprecedented and sustained protests that they have generated. I think the intensity of the protests has surprised many of us because while people are rightfully angry about the trashing of the Constitution the NRC and the CAA are part of a much longer process of fascist hegemony-building which has been underway for decades. There have been many organizations and individuals who have been speaking out against Hindu majoritarianism over the years. People stood up courageously against the 2002 anti-Muslim pogroms in Gujarat which took place when Modi was the chief minister of that state and also against the hundreds of atrocities committed by the RSS since Modi came to power in 2014 at the federal level. Some of them even lost their lives like the activist-journalist Gauri Lankesh. But none of these moments generated the same amount of spontaneous outrage that we’re seeing now. On the one hand I think this has to do with the fact that these two legal reforms threaten to upend the lives of so many people at once. On the other hand I think we have to see it as an expression of discontent that has been festering for many many years—a pressure cooker which is now exploding. Altogether within India there are 139 million internal migrants according to the national census and over 200 million Dalits and a hundred million Adivasis (or indigenous people). All of these populations are incredibly precarious and increasingly dispossessed and they too will be affected by these Islamophobic laws. That is one reason why the CAA and NRC have inspired a rebellion among these sections especially Dalits. We’ve seen this in marches and rallies against the CAA and NRC led by the Bhim Army (‘Bhim’ refers to the Dalit liberation leader Bhimrao Ambedkar). These rebellions are particularly threatening to the BJP because they don’t want Muslims to find solidarity with any section of Indian society that the BJP considers “Hindu.” Many of the protests are also being led and attended by Muslim women who in the worldview of the Hindu nationalists have no agency. I attended one of these protest sites in Bombay where 200 to 500 people have been sitting in for weeks. Many of the women there told me that this was their first time attending a protest let alone partaking in any activity outside their homes for a prolonged period of time. These kinds of stories are emerging everywhere So these developments are extremely positive. Although using the COVID pandemic as an excuse the government has evicted many of these protesters including from Shaheen Bagh (in Delhi) which is the epicenter of the resistance. But I’m optimistic that the uprising will resume very soon because the anger is so widely and deeply felt right now. It’s not dying down. : Like many of the things that the Modi government has done the lockdown has been imposed with a very heavy authoritarian hand. But let’s step back a little bit and talk about the nature of Modi’s political party the BJP. Some people have described it as fascist. Others think of Modi as India’s version of Donald Trump. How would you describe the nature of this political formation and how does that illuminate the way in which they have responded to the present crisis? : This is a longstanding debate in India and I don’t think it will be resolved any time soon but I’ll just give you a sense of some of the contours of the debate. On one side we have liberal commentators like Ramachandra Guha and Amartya Sen who have long argued that India’s democracy will or can act as a bulwark against the rise of authoritarianism and fascism on a large scale. I remember before Modi’s first election in 2014 there were some editorials from this camp that were reasoning that even if Modi and the BJP came to power at the federal level the state governments would act as a counterweight to Hindutva politics because enough of the states would not be governed by the BJP. They also argued that if some of the media fell into the hands of the Hindu authoritarians there would be other voices in the media doggedly pursuing the truth. But I think the last six years under Modi’s rule has made a mockery of this argument because many of these so-called checks and balances have utterly failed us. In contrast to the liberal commentators there is a section of the left that claims that while the Sangh Parivar (the network of Hindu organizations of which the RSS and the BJP are a part) clearly possesses some fascistic tendencies India is not in a fascist situation—at least not yet. A fascist situation requires a mass movement which the Sangh Parivar has successfully built but it also requires a dictatorship which they do not have. People who espouse this view posit that in order for a fascist situation to emerge there needs to be an economic and social crisis that pushes the national elites to abandon bourgeois democracy. This would also be predicated on the perception that the working class is growing too powerful and must be crushed. Others on the left have rejected this view on the grounds that such formulations are based too heavily on the experiences of interwar Europe and cannot simply be mapped onto the case of India or the Sangh Parivar which is a different form of fascism with distinct characteristics. I think that both of these approaches by the left have validity and warrant further thought and debate. That being said it is unlikely that the Muslim women who are sitting in against the CAA and NRC—some of whom have faced down an active shooter—are waiting for the left to resolve this question before they continue their fight. In other words the resistance against Hindu authoritarianism doesn’t rely on us resolving these theoretical dilemmas. whether we call it “fascist” or not what we know is that the condition of Indian democracy is dire. Press freedom is at a low right now. Activists are being imprisoned and minorities are being lynched by the RSS in pogroms such as the one that happened in Delhi in February which resulted in at least 53 deaths (most of whom were Muslims). People who participate in these pogroms are treated with complete impunity. On top of that an entire state of 12.5 million people has been kept under a total lockdown and communications blackout for more than 200 days now. is the fact that the Hindu authoritarians also constitute a mass movement which spans civil society. The RSS has around five to six million members and more than 56 000 branches (or shakhas) across the country. The Sangh Parivar consists of hundreds of organizations that penetrate right down to the household level. They have unions and more. In this sense I would say that compared to the other new varieties of right-wing authoritarianism—or populism or whatever you want to call it—led by Le Pen or Trump or Bolsonaro the movement that Modi is leading is perhaps the most advanced of all of them. : Can you say more about the structure of the BJP? Who is part of its base and how has the party changed since its inception? : The BJP was formed in 1980 and since then it has been viewed as a party of the upper castes. Its founding members were mostly Brahmins and it historically has had a high proportion of support from the upper castes as compared to the middle and lower castes. I think that makes perfect sense which is the leading cultural organization of the Sangh Parivar openly aspires to replace the Indian Constitution with the Manusmriti. One of the leading ideologues of the RSS called the Manusmriti “the greatest lawgiver.” The Manusmriti is a religious text where the rules of the caste system are most clearly spelled out. It mandates that the lower castes meekly serve the upper castes. It specifies a number of rules and punishments to be used essentially to keep lower-caste people subservient. One example of that is if a Shudra man has sex with an upper-caste woman he can be castrated or put to death. This is a book that the RSS worships. By contrast one of the leaders of the Dalit liberation movement and one of the founders of India used to publicly burn the Manusmriti. These were and continue to be the ideological bearings of the Sangh Parivar. But I think it’s important to understand that for the upper castes it’s not simply a devotion to this particular interpretation of Hinduism that draws them to the Sangh Parivar it’s also the fact that in India the category of caste and the category of class roughly overlap. So in the mind of the capitalist supporters of the BJP (who are also upper caste) it’s in their class interest to control and dominate the poor and laboring castes. There’s also a sort of dilemma that is operating here. Many political scientists posited that the BJP could not possibly establish a base among the majority of India which is comprised of lower castes—OBCs [Other Backward Classes] and Adivasis—given these groups’ material interests are directly at odds with the programmatic orientation of the party. the BJP was formed in the 1980s a time when the electoral system in India was being completely shaken up. The Congress Party “system” was in decline and for the first time in independent India the lower castes had begun to participate in elections effectively. there was a new party formed called the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) which explicitly opposed the domination of lower castes by the upper castes and made it a point to expand representation of lower castes. the BJP had a problem—specifically how could it compete with parties like the BSP which appealed directly and programmatically to the lower-caste populations? To address this problem the BJP started to have internal discussions as early as the early 1990s. Based on these discussions they experimented with different models to try to attract lower-caste voters ranging from the cooptation of Dalit leaders and the appropriation of Dalit icons to trying to extend patronage and service networks to Dalits and Adivasis. But it’s only really recently that these strategies have started to bear fruit for the BJP. Recently the BJP has expanded its base significantly among the lower castes. It’s said that part of the reason for their landslide victory at the federal level in 2019 was because of a surge in support among Dalits who had actually already started supporting the party a decade ago. Interestingly the BJP meanwhile hasn’t alienated its upper-caste core. This was something that the leaders of the BJP were afraid of in their social-engineering experiments as they called them—in their efforts to try to rope in the lower castes. : How has the BJP managed to be successful in attracting the lower castes? : One clue can be found in a new autobiography called I Could Not Be Hindu who was an RSS member and also a Dalit. He joined the RSS when he was a child and quickly became a dedicated activist. But the contradictions emerged for him. Despite the fact that he’s this exceptionally capable cadre he can never be promoted to a higher-level position in the RSS. He wants to become a pracharak but eventually he’s taken aside by an RSS leader and told “I personally have no problem with you being a Dalit but others in the organization would have a problem so it’s better not to disturb the peace.” While the author of the autobiography accepts these explanations for a while he eventually can no longer tolerate the hypocrisy and leaves the RSS. For the author and perhaps for many other former members of the RSS the contradiction between the words (that Hindus are all part of one big united family) and the actions (where some are treated as inferior) are too stark and they can’t be reconciled. But there’s another interesting aspect of this autobiography where the author is enumerating the various explanations or justifications the RSS uses to shut down so-called bothersome questions like: Why are animals treated better than Dalits under Hinduism? Why do Hindus worship the dung of cows but they won’t share a meal with Dalits? One such attempt at an explanation by the RSS is that the “worst” aspects of caste were imposed by medieval Muslim invaders and were never part of the “original which simply viewed the caste system as a means to efficiently divide labor in society. I found his autobiography interesting because it explains the granular ways in which the RSS tries to ideologically indoctrinate lower-caste people. But there’s also another strategy used by the RSS which has been written about by Anand Teltumbde—another prominent Dalit intellectual who was recently imprisoned for his activism. He’s written about how the BJP is trying to aggressively appropriate the image of Ambedkar.9 If you read some of the BJP’s texts they claim that Ambedkar was a Hindu nationalist and that he was impressed by the RSS all these stories are baseless but they’ve still met with some degree of success in winning over these sections whose interests are directly at odds with Hindutva. In addition to these forms of ideological conditioning there are also material dimensions of Hindutva. In this regard there is growing research the most important of which is by the political scientist Tariq Thatchil which suggests that Dalit and Adivasi support for the BJP is incumbent not on but rather because these groups have been steadily receiving reliable services from the BJP’s partner organizations—private social service organizations that are affiliated to the Sangh Parivar.10 The most important ones are Seva Bharati (which mostly targets the urban poor) and Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram (which targets Adivasis in remote areas). these organizations embed themselves in areas where there is a high concentration of Adivasis or Dalits and where the welfare system is failing to reach or provide for the people. These organizations will offer health care or education with no strings attached thereby fulfilling an essential service for the poor. In exchange Dalits and Adivasis reward the BJP with their votes. Thachil argues that the BJP was able to draw on this strategy for the many years when it wasn’t in power either at the federal or the state level because these private networks of service don’t rely on government funding. They rely on voluntary donations and voluntary labor which is the hallmark of the Sangh Parivar. now that the BJP has taken power and they have a very strong electoral mandate they’re also using the state’s financial resources to enlarge their support among these sections. There are a few initiatives that seem to have been more effective than others in this regard. There’s a financial inclusion program which was started in Modi’s first term an affordable housing program (the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana) and then there’s a program that provides gas fuel connections for cooking to poor people. They’ve also provided public goods such as the construction of roads and electricity. Some analysis suggests that these programs did indeed help enlarge the BJP’s support in the 2019 election particularly among large sections of the rural population including the rural proletariat and Dalits. I still think the fact that you see these classes giving their votes to the BJP is quite puzzling particularly because in Modi’s first term the economic conditions didn’t unambiguously favor them. In fact unemployment was at a 40-year high in Modi’s first term. The government originally promised to create 20 million jobs and created maybe 1 or 2 percent of that. On top of that Modi initiated a demonetization initiative where 86 percent of the currency in circulation was suddenly declared illegitimate bringing on financial catastrophe for small producers and poor people. But perhaps as far as voting behavior is concerned these new welfare programs and private sources of welfare have in a sense overshadowed the economic failures of the BJP at least temporarily. I’ve seen some analysis that suggests it might be explained by the novelty of these programs. Some of them were newly created while others were inherited from the previous Congress regime and simply rebranded. But Modi has also spent an unprecedented amount of money just touting the success of these programs through advertising. All of these variables need to be examined with much more in-depth historical and sociological study. : That’s fascinating and very important. They’re very opportunistic plausible opposition at the moment it’s easier for them to pull people in their direction. So let’s turn to the opposition and the left. How are various left forces intervening at the moment and what steps do you think need to be taken to consolidate the opposition—the opposition around the CAA and to Hindutva in general? How can a viable political left be built in India? : The organized parliamentary left in India as probably in most of the world has been in a long crisis which spans decades. In many parts of the country unions have been reduced to bureaucratic appendages of industrial management and have been unable to keep up with the rapid structural changes in the neoliberal economy. The proportion of temporary and casual or migrant laborers has shot way up compared to the permanent workers who typically constituted the core union membership. Politically the left really only viably contests for power in one state But as far as the CAA and the NRC protests go there’s a lot of potential for the left to begin to rebuild. In Kerala the Left Front government led by the CPI(M)—the Communist Party of India (Marxist)—has been carrying out regular rallies and protest meetings across the state even in small towns and villages where they’re educating people about how their rights will be affected. They even organized a 600-kilometer-long human-chain where people took a pledge to protect the Constitution against the Hindutva onslaught. But the parliamentary left’s presence has been more or less limited to Kerala and a few university campuses when it comes to their intervention in this particular political moment. And in these sit-ins as I was talking about where Muslim women are putting their lives on the line very rarely do we see the parliamentary left showing up and providing resources. I think that is a missed opportunity. In order for the left to constitute a real challenge to the rising Hindutva tide it has to see these spaces as opportunities not just to expand its own agenda but also to learn. I also think the left would benefit from a deeper engagement with anti-oppression activists who have been urging it to expand its definition of class struggle beyond the point of production to include struggles but also against caste oppression or in support of #MeToo-type movements—what feminists call struggles around social reproduction. These are the areas where India has seen the most vibrant resistance in recent years. the role of the left has to be first and foremost to listen to the members of these struggles the left has been late to the game. They have to work with these various groups who have been involved in these struggles to build trust. If they do this I believe the left could play an important role in uniting these groups to build a larger counter-hegemonic force. This will be a long and drawn-out process as the right tends to understand better than the left there are really no shortcuts when you organize to change the course of history.

1620764023.330201,64319717,https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1754/cibola---the-seven-cities-of-gold--coronado/,"Ancient History Encyclopedia has a new name! to better reflect the breadth of our non-profit organization's mission. If you have bookmarks or links to our site on your blog or website Cibola - The Seven Cities of Gold & Coronado of Cibola are the mythical lands of that the Spanish of the 16th century believed existed somewhere in the southwest of North America comparable to the better-known mythical . The cities were first attested to by four survivors of the disastrous Narvaez Expedition of 1527 including the explorer Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca (d. c. 1560) in 1536. De Vaca’s report was later “corroborated” by the Franciscan friar Marcos de Niza (l. c. 1495-1558) in 1539. De Niza’s colorful description of the wealthy site encouraged the 1540 expedition into North America by conquistador Francisco Vázquez de Coronado (l. 1510-1554) who found no such cities. Seekers of the Seven Cities of Gold The Coronado expedition did manage to kill a large number of Native Americans either directly or by robbing their food supplies so they starved. Setting out from Compostela in northwest Mexico Coronado traveled to modern-day New Mexico where he found the tales of the golden city to be a fable. After taking the city he then destroyed other communities before being convinced of the existence of an even grander city of gold and his quest to find this mythical place took him as far north as modern-day Kansas. The natives he had abused after taking Cibola were later found to have invented Quivira as a means to send him off into the wilderness where he and his men would weaken and die. who had been so certain of the reports of de Niza that he had funded it himself. Although Coronado is often praised as the first European to explore the southwest his immediate effect on the region was negative and the expedition’s only real significance is in the report by Garcia López de Cárdenas (l. c. 1540s) and others which provide a first-hand account of the lives of the native peoples they encountered and natural formations such as the Grand Canyon. The persistent boast by historians that Coronado’s expedition was the first to see such sites and record such things increasingly rings hollow as more people in the modern era have come to recognize the shallow motivation of the expedition and the destruction it wrought on Native American communities. Word of the riches to the north reached the viceroy of New Spain who then ordered a scouting party organized. The story of the Seven Cities of Cibola begins with an expedition that had nothing to do with it. In 1527 the conquistador Pánfilo de Narváez (d. 1528) was sent from Spain with 600 men and five ships to colonize Florida which had been claimed for the Spanish Crown by Ponce de León (l. 1474-1521) in 1513. They were shipwrecked off Cuba in a storm that drove the roughly 400 survivors onto the shores of the west coast of Florida Narváez had no idea where he was and divided his party in two with over 100 to travel by ship and the remainder by land to head north where he expected to find a harbor. Although Ponce de León had claimed the land he was unable to establish a fort or leave any kind of directional so Narváez can hardly be blamed for becoming disoriented. The ship and the land party lost sight of each other and those on land continued to march until they wound up in the region of modern-day Texas. Once no harbor was found nor any landmarks mentioned in de León’s report Narváez made the decision to have rafts built which would be used to navigate the coast and find where they should have landed. A storm drowned most of the 300 aboard the rafts thrown back onto the Florida coast died in the following months until there were only four: Alonso del Castillo Maldonado (d. 1547) Andrés Dorantes de Carranza (d. 1550s) who was owned by de Carranza. The four men walked across Texas were captured by natives who enslaved them for four years and fled into the interior. Over the next few years the men lived among the natives traveling from place to place acquired a reputation as healers and finally made it back to Mexico City in 1536 where the stories of their adventures – and especially of the vast wealth of the lands they had traveled through and glistening cities of gold – attracted significant attention.

Word of the riches to the north finally reached the viceroy of New Spain Antonio de Mendoza (l. 1495-1552) who then ordered a scouting party organized to be led by the friar Marcos de Niza in 1539. The problem was that no one knew where these cities of gold were. De Vaca the main source of these stories had sailed back to Spain in 1537 and even if he had not (as his later published work on his adventures shows) he would not have been very much help since he called the people he met and places he visited by his own names depending on what they ate what a certain rock formation reminded him of. Estevanico was still in the area and de Niza chose him as the guide. Estevanico was most likely only too happy to return to the north and live as a free man again and so the small party set out. As they traveled they attracted native traders who encouraged de Niza with stories of the great cities of gold they were sure to arrive at soon. Estevanico was sent ahead of the main group to locate the cities and send word back and after some unknown number of days or weeks a native scout brought word that Estevanico had found Cibola and was waiting there. Scholar Bill Yenne relates Estevanico’s description to de Niza: There were ""Seven very large cities which were all subject to one lord. In them were large houses of stone and mortar the smallest of which were one storey high with a terrace and there were besides two- and three-storied buildings. The chief’s house was of four stories. There were many decorations at the entrance of the principal houses which were very plentiful in the country. The people of these cities were very well clothed"". (125) De Niza hurried to catch up with Estevanico but then received word he had been killed. No one knows how he died (there is also the claim that he was not killed but only faked his but de Niza was told that he had tried to impersonate a man and had demanded valuables and women from the people of the city; so they killed him. De Niza was afraid to go any further and so climbed a mesa and ""without actually setting foot in one lingering look at the pueblos…and quickly retreated to Mexico"" (Yenne he entertained Mendoza and others with tales of the fabulous cities he had seen. Yenne comments: He let his imagination run rampant reporting things that he could not have seen without entering one of the seven cities. He wrote of huge pearls and emeralds [and] he said that the people ate off of gold and plates…He also claimed that the Seven Cities of Cibola were equal in population to Mexico City. (127) The impression given was of a vast and wealthy urban center and although de Niza could not possibly have known it he was actually correct. The cities he had seen were part of the Zuni-Cibola Complex of modern-day New Mexico which at that time was the largest center in the region. Scholar James J. Drexler notes: [Cibola] was a center of trade over a vast and active trading network that covered most of northern Mexico and much of the western United States. Cibola trading extended eastward to the Great Plains region where they obtained bison hides and westward to at least the lower Colorado River…The trade network extended to the west coast of Mexico where the natives of Cibola obtained seashells and southward into present-day Mexico where they obtained various brightly feathered birds. The Cibolans were aware of the Mississippi River the Gulf coast of Texas and Mexico the west coast of California the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River and the rivers and plains of Oklahoma and Kansas. There were civilized people with an ancient culture and tradition. (103) Mendoza was not so much interested in what de Niza had to say about the people living at Cibola except in so far as they sounded like they would be able to pay enormous amounts of tribute once they were conquered; and so he organized a second Coronado was so confident of success & the riches he would return with that he would even finance the entire venture himself. Coronado was the governor of New Galicia (modern-day Sinaloa and surrounding areas in Mexico) in New Spain at this time and married to a woman from a wealthy family. He was backed by her family and secure in his position when he heard de Niza’s story of Cibola and volunteered his services to Mendoza to lead the expedition. He was so confident of success and the riches he would return with that he would even finance the entire venture himself. Mendoza put up some of the money required so he would have a further stake in the spoils. No one doubted de Niza’s report was accurate and as the story of the friar’s adventure to the fabulous city was retold the buildings became larger and the wealth even grander. Coronado took de Niza as his faithful guide and set out with three hundred soldiers over a thousand native auxiliaries and herds of extra horses almost all of this paid for by himself In early July they reached the place where de Niza said Estevanico had been killed; it looked nothing like the fabulous cities he had described back in New Spain. Coronado’s officer and chronicler looking as if it had been crumpled all up together. There are haciendas in New Spain which make a better appearance at a distance. It is a village of about two hundred warriors is three and four stories high with the houses small and having only a few rooms and without a courtyard. (136) and when the people refused he attacked. According to Castaneda’s account it was not an easy and Coronado himself was wounded. The Spanish were able to defeat the Cibolans due to their use of cavalry and superior firepower which awed the natives and finally led to them abandoning the city. When Coronado marched in expecting to find heaps of gold and jewels he found nothing but broken ceramic pots Jan Mostaert / Jan Arkesteijn (Public Domain) Castaneda reports that Coronado and the others immediately turned on de Niza and were so angry that Castaneda worried for the friar’s safety ""such were the curses that some hurled at Friar Marcos that I pray God may protect him from them"" (136). Coronado inspected the city thoroughly and then wrote a report to Mendoza that the friar’s account had been false; he sent de Niza along with the departing troops to deliver it. Castaneda in describing the friar’s departure apparently forgets about his earlier fears for de Niza’s safety and more or less calls him a liar: [De Niza went back] because he did not think it was safe for him to stay in Cibola seeing that his report had turned out to be entirely false because the kingdoms that he had told about had not been found nor the wealth of gold nor the precious stones which he had reported nor other things that had been proclaimed from the pulpits. (136-137) Coronado then sent his officers to explore the region while he completed the task of appropriating Zuni homes and food supplies. Word was sent out to the other native communities that ""Christians had come into the country whose only desire was to be their friends"" and all were welcome to come and talk with Coronado there was not a great response to this offer (Yenne were initially greeted with song and gifts when they arrived at different communities and the people welcomed them until they found the new arrivals could not be trusted. At the Tiguex pueblos (near modern-day Santa Fe New Mexico) Coronado met a native from the Mississippi region who was being kept as a slave who is known from Castaneda’s reports as ""the Turk"". The Turk told Coronado of a fabulous land of riches to the north known as Quivira and offered to lead him there. The party set out in April or May of 1541 and after well over a month had found nothing suggesting a city of gold although the Turk continually assured them it was just a little further ahead. Along the way the expedition murdered 200 natives in one village by burning some at the stake and trampling others under their horses stole food supplies and left the people to starve and destroyed native homes and villages as a means of establishing order Coronado still found himself no closer to the golden city of Quivira. Finally and he confronted the Turk who admitted he had lied and there was no such place. The Turk told Coronado he had only wanted to be free and hoped to make his way back to his people by leading the Spanish on this quest but he had been told to purposefully mislead Coronado by the natives around Cibola who had hoped he would become lost and die in the wilderness. Coronado listened to his explanation and then had him strangled. Afterwards he announced they would be returning to New Spain since in the words of one of his officers ""the party never found a land in which it would be possible to settle"" and the Seven Cities of Cibola had turned out to lack ""wealth and civilization"" (Flint 2). Coronado arrived back in New Spain in the spring of 1542 and resumed his position as governor of New Galicia but he was disgraced and bankrupt. De Niza was also publicly scorned but was never punished and lived out the rest of his life in obscurity. The quest for the Seven Cities of Cibola was only one of over 130 expeditions launched by the Spanish in the Americas in search of gold during this period. At the same time Coronado was ravaging the southwest Hernando de Soto (l. c. 1500-1542) was raping and burning the villages of the natives of the Mississippi River Valley on his quest for the gold he was sure they had hidden. Gonzalo Pizarro (l. 1510-1548) the younger brother of Francisco Pizzaro (conqueror of the Incas) was also active in 1541 destroying and enslaving native communities in Ecuador in his search for the golden city of El Dorado. These expeditions have been praised for centuries as ""firsts"" as though the landscape and the people had no inherent value until they were ""discovered"" by Europeans who are always characterized as explorers rather than as slavers or simply greedy opportunists who took advantage of populations that initially welcomed and helped them. Coronado’s expedition to Cibola is nothing to celebrate any more than any of the others are. The Cibola expedition was a ludicrous project based on lies and driven by avarice which accomplished little beyond the loss of lives in communities which had existed on the lands Coronado rode through for thousands of years. None of those people could have cared less that these Spanish were the first to record their land and culture in history. Continual praise of expeditions like Coronado’s is comparable to admiration heaped on a bank robber who after killing everyone in the building ; history texts regularly focus on the coin while largely ignoring the cost of its discovery. The Seven Cities of Cibola never existed any more than El Dorado or Quivira but the quest to find these imaginary places resulted in the destruction of very real ones and that is the real story of Cibola.

The pandemic has changed consumer behavior in big and small ways — and retailers are responding in kind. Since the early days of the pandemic Ernst & Young has been tracking these shifting trends using the EY Future Consumer Index and EY embryonic platform which show a significant and widespread industry shift toward e-commerce. In this article the authors suggest that while e-commerce will continue to be an essential element of retail strategy the future success of retailers will ultimately depend on creating a cohesive customer experience both online and in stores. If we have learned one thing from the past year it’s that things can change in an instant — changes we thought we had years to prepare for behaviors we assumed we’d stick to forever expectations we have of ourselves and our organizations. This is true of the way we live and the way we shop and buy as consumers. which has surveyed thousands of consumers since the early days of the pandemic found that 80% of U.S. consumers are still changing the way they shop. Sixty percent are currently visiting brick-and-mortar stores less than before the pandemic and 43% shop more often online for products they would have previously bought in stores. One of the most significant effects of Covid-19 is the realization that geographical location has become less relevant — so long as there’s an internet connection. This flexibility allows more consumers to move away from urban centers; the latest Index data shows that plan to live in less densely populated areas up from 22% in April of 2020. e-commerce strategies shift from a perpetual top priority on every retailer’s three-year plan to a desperately needed lifeline that could enable them to survive a global pandemic. We found that retailers made approximately $10 billion in e-commerce investments acquisitions and partnerships from May to July 2020. These investments spanned logistics capabilities to enable last-mile asset-light approaches like ghost kitchens (restaurants with a space for kitchen equipment and facilities but no dining area for walk-in customers) and dark stores (retail distribution centers that cater exclusively to online shopping) as well as product portfolio investments geared toward digital capabilities in AI and blockchain. this past year has accelerated previously existing efforts to innovate. But for many others it has spurred a great reset of the way they think about consumers’ needs and the future of digital commerce. What consumer experience do you want to create? you need to think bigger than e-commerce. The core question retailers must ask themselves first is not “What e-commerce investments do I need to make?” but rather “What consumer experience do I need to offer?” This is a culture change for many retailers who’ve long had a mentality that’s anchored in brick-and-mortar stores. The consumer experience is rapidly evolving from one that’s built upon the transactional process of in-store shopping to one that’s rooted in deep ongoing and enriching relationships. As a retailer you need to create an interwoven journey that’s relevant to your target consumer — and structure your channel ecosystem in a way that provides value along that journey. Considering the consumer’s entire journey is especially important in today’s environment such as feeling a sense of community will impact their buying habits as the conditions of the pandemic continue to change. While the shift toward online shopping will likely remain the desire for post-pandemic social interaction will likely drive people back to stores. Case in point: The Index found that 38% of consumers intend to do more shopping online and visit stores that provide great experiences. In order to offer consumers the journey they need retailers must understand the future of experience-led capabilities. E-commerce is a key piece of that future. But it’s not just about being online — it’s about doing it right and continuing to consider how in-person shopping fits into the customer’s overall journey. how can retailers think about this integrated consumer journey and how e-commerce fits into it? Here are some core questions to help define investment and operating model decisions. adaptive technology platform that understands that every consumer journey is different? Is my organizational structure free of silos — which isolate e-commerce and marketing — that interrupt the experience? Have I considered my assortment congruity — what’s online and what’s in store and the logic behind channel exclusivity? How can I be price-competitive and still maintain margin? For example how can I introduce impulse purchases in an online environment? What role does store layout and merchandising play in this? How do I orchestrate the consumer journey from digital to physical and back again? how do I maintain the experience all the way to consumers’ doorsteps? It all comes down to delivery. E-commerce success depends on the last mile. Today’s consumers aren’t keen on excuses especially when it comes to accessibility and convenience. The Index found that only one in five (21%) U.S. consumers say they are forgiving retailers and brands for service disruptions due to Covid-19. In other words the pandemic is no longer a reasonable excuse for not delivering orders on time. Today in the last mile due to surges in online shopping. As many of us experienced after Black Friday in 2020 it took weeks for products to finally arrive on our doorsteps. Even the most advanced e commerce capabilities can’t conceal the importance of fulfillment as delivery becomes a cornerstone of the experience. The Index found that 37% of U.S. consumers will buy online and pick up in store more often in the future. But buyer beware: curbside or in-store pickup can quickly lose its luster if consumers endure long wait times in a jammed-up parking lot or if their local store inventory can’t accommodate their online purchases. So while the store as a fulfillment center can be an effective strategy it requires systems and business units that communicate with each other to deliver on the promise. As services scale so must retailers’ ability to deliver a consistent experience. Regardless of how consumer behavior continues to change retailers must be prepared to continue to develop stronger deeper relationships with their customers — both online and in person.

1620764066.384866,82431220,https://www.ushistory.org/declaration/related/frin.html,When in the course of human events . . . The final Colonial War (1689-1763) was the French and Indian War which is the name given to the American theater of a massive conflict involving Austria and Sweden called the Seven Years War. The conflict was played out in Europe and North America. In Europe and France were allied to crush the rising power of Frederick the Great King of Prussia. The English and the French battled for colonial domination in North America and in India. The English did ultimately come to dominate the colonial outposts but at a cost so staggering that the resulting debt nearly destroyed the English government. It was that debt that caused the escalation of tensions leading to the Revolutionary War. Parliament was desperate to obtain two objectives; first to tax the colonies to recover monies expended on the battle over North America and second to restore the profitability of the East India Company in an effort to recover monies spent on the battle over India. as it was referred to in the colonies was the beginning of open hostilities between the colonies and Gr. Britain. England and France had been building toward a conflict in America since 1689. These efforts resulted in the remarkable growth of the colonies from a population of 250 to 1.25 million in 1750. Britain required raw materials including copper and turpentine. They also required a great deal of money and so they provided that all of these American products be shipped exclusively to England (the Navigation Acts). In an effort to raise revenue and simultaneously interfere with the French in the Caribbean a 6 pence tax on each gallon of molasses was imposed in 1733 (the Molasses Act see note: The Sugar Act). Enforcement of these regulations became difficult so the English government established extensive customs services and vice-admiralty courts empowered to identify and convict suspected smugglers. These devices were exclusive of the colonial mechanisms of justice. The colonies were wholly interested in overcoming the French in North America and appealed to the King for permission to raise armies and monies to defend themselves.* Despite sincere petitions from the royal governors George II was suspicious of the intentions of the colonial governments and declined their offer. English officers in America were also widely contemptuous of colonials who volunteered for service. A few of the men who signed the Declaration had been members of volunteer militia who had been dressed down and sent home when they applied for duty. Such an experience was not uncommon. It led communities throughout the colonies to question British authorities who would demand horses and quarters — but deny colonials the right to fight in defense of the Empire a right which they considered central to their self-image as Englishmen. ,[],Yes,"politics:0.13488630950450897,history:0.08095302432775497",

1620764097.212695,72210893,https://newpol.org/issue_post/latin-america-in-the-time-of-covid/,"Latin America in the Time of COVID (New Politics Vol. XVIII No. 2 to die of hunger or to die of the virus.” the health crisis has exposed the brutal realities of the global capitalist system: the extreme inequality that has marked the global economy and the destruction of social services and public resources in the interests of private capital euphemistically called “structural adjustment “the war on poverty” declared by the World Bank. And that has continued into the COVID era at an accelerating pace. Even in the face of what purports to be a universal pandemic the very rich—Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates among others—have increased their enormous wealth as the bulk of the planet’s population pays for the contraction of the world economy. And that will be the pattern as the gulf between the rich and the rest grows wider and the costs of the pandemic are passed on to its victims again. Latin America exposes the brutality of a global capitalist system in its most naked forms. Three decades of “structural adjustments” left the state weakened and deprived the public sector of resources. At the same time the organizations of self-defense of workers the urban poor—from trade unions to grass-roots and community organs—were repressed and undermined. Neoliberalism not only exacerbated the unequal distribution of income across the world it systematically attacked the capacity of the majority populations to protect themselves and removed what instruments of popular mobilization existed within the state. It had already announced the nature of its project in its first experiment the overthrow of the Allende government in Chile in 1973 and its replacement by a brutal military regime. In this way it created the conditions that would allow the spread of the virus across the region. The ecological destruction implied by the expansion of export agriculture laid waste to 25 percent of the Amazon rainforest not only reducing biodiversity but also hastening the human-animal contact that is one source of the new viruses. The commodity boom of the nineties and beyond expanded mining across the region at a rate and with an urgency fueled by the Chinese construction boom. As the local state was progressively weakened by privatization and disinvestment in the public sector those controls on production that existed were pushed aside and water supplies were contaminated with the mercury and other chemicals associated with the extraction of gold. The widespread use of pesticides and the spread of genetically modified crops in an agricultural sector producing soya and palm oil for the world market and the expanding cattle-raising across the region took their huge environmental toll. The cost of the association of hamburgers with modernity and growth has been incalculable. And that expansion of export agriculture has reduced dramatically the amount of land available for domestic food production replacing that food with imported consumer products and expelling millions of small farmers and agricultural workers from the land. These former agricultural workers are now internal migrants who live in the slum cities surrounding Latin America´s megacities where the absence of sanitation and the fragile housing vulnerable to floods and earthquakes prepared the ideal circumstances for the rapid spread of a virus. These populations—once small farmers or workers now without jobs as deindustrialization followed the transformation of the land—became “informal” workers another distortion of language to veil a reality of precarious unstable jobs along with low wages the absence of protection at work and a dependence on family incomes. In the overcrowded street markets they sell cheap imitations of the luxury consumer products that are on sale inside the bright new shopping malls built by their labor. Those who cannot find work continue their perilous journeys to the United States or Europe where they inhabit the shadow world of the undocumented—casual laborers in construction the remittances from those migrants now make up around a third of the region’s gross domestic product. As the public sector in Latin America it was the remittances that filled the gap. The cruel irony is that it fell to the poor to support the poor. a military coup led by Augusto Pinochet overthrew the popularly-elected reform government of Salvador Allende. Allende´s crime was to introduce economic measures designed to take the profits from the production of copper and use them to develop new industries and lay the foundations for a welfare state—improving the health service and redistributing land and wealth for the benefit of the majority. It was not a revolutionary program but it was driven by a democratic impulse and was actively supported by an organized mass movement. Allende was killed in the course of the coup and the new government attributed its policies to the ideas of Milton Friedman the guru of neoliberalism. Its argument that capital must be allowed to move freely across the planet in search of profit required the “removal of obstacles to trade.” Chile demonstrated that in practice this meant the suppression of workers’ organizations active repression by a terrorist state and the elimination of human and civil rights. The Constitution of 1980 written by the military regime when 76 percent of those voting in a long-postponed referendum demanded a new democratic constitution. But in the intervening years Chile became a model for a society dominated by the interests of private capital; its state pension plan was private and it still has no universal public health system. The 1994 Zapatista uprising in Chiapas occurred as state subsidies to small farmers growing maize were removed leaving the market open to domination by U.S. corn-farming corporations. As the first “Dispatches from the Lacandon Forest” explained in their characteristically poetic language the Zapatista communities were the victims of an expanding neoliberal global capitalism for which the local state and all public services continued to represent obstacles to the free movement of capital—one requirement of which was the severe restriction of the freedom of migrant laborers to cross the planet in search of work. Yet the new millennium did change the face of Latin America after a decade in which austerity and cutbacks affected the lives of the majority including the more than 60 percent of the population working in the “informal” sector. The collapse of Eastern Europe had a profound effect on the Latin American left which seemed to sink into a kind of melancholia as “actually existing socialism was revealed to veil tyranny and dictatorship and to have been driven by the laws of motion of capitalism. The moment was famously described as “the end of history”—though that was intended to mean that capitalism now prevailed and all alternatives were now consigned to memory. Yet in a remote corner of Mexico and the message was broadcast widely on the newly emerging World Wide Web. The election of Hugo Chavez to the presidency of Venezuela in 1999 seemed to signal a new “Bolivarian” epoch—a new radical nationalism opposed to neoliberalism and challenging U.S. imperialism which Chavez did with wit and charm. The program of the new republic and the content of its new Constitution passed by a delegate assembly late that year promised that the oil industry which provided 90 percent of Venezuela’s export earnings of which only 1 percent returned to the public treasury in royalties would now be nationalized. That income would then be employed to lift the living standards of those 65 percent of Venezuelans who had been reduced to poverty in the preceding decade; it would be invested in providing health services and housing for the majority population. It was in a sense a return to the unfulfilled program of the Allende government with its promise of reestablishing national sovereignty and breaking the economic dependence on a single product owned and distributed by foreign capital that had subordinated the country to an unequal and exploitative relationship with the global market. In Chile´s case that product was copper; in the case of Venezuela as well as Bolivia and Ecuador Two events drove the new process in a more radical direction. At the beginning of 2000 the Bolivian government´s decision to sell off the city of Cochabamba’s public water company generated a movement of popular resistance that drew together workers and the surrounding indigenous communities in a Committee for the Defense of Water and Life. The movement’s determined struggle forced the government to reverse the decision and return the water company to public control. The same situation recurred in the indigenous city of Los Altos in 2003. It was a first popular victory against privatization and neoliberalism. It was not just the victory itself that was important but also the manner of its achievement. The organized left was largely absent from the movements and the method of organizing was inspired by indigenous traditions of struggle and by an insistence on democratic and transparent forms of organization often based on historical experience that echoed the anti-capitalist movement that was spreading across the world. The emphasis was on “self-activity” or “self-emancipation ” as well as on the idea of the common ownership of natural resources. The second key event was the attempted coup against Chavez organized by the oil company managers and their multinational supporters in April 2002. The coup was a spectacular failure. Chavez was kidnapped but then released when hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans surrounded the presidential palace and demanded his return. What these events had in common was that the outcomes were driven by mass mobilizations—the majority was seizing the stage of history and beginning to articulate a vision of a different kind of society. But the movements still lacked a political project a strategy for achieving this new world. The logic of the “new social movements” pointed in the direction of the “participatory democracy” on which the new Bolivarian Constitution was based. For the moment as the movements grew in Bolivia and Ecuador overturning governments in the process the alternative logic—the conquest of state power of government—in the absence of an organized left did not command much authority. The two logics came into conflict in the practice of the new movements. When Evo Morales was carried to power in late 2005 a debate arose about the delegate convention called to rewrite the country’s constitution. The grass-roots organizations were denied representation at the meeting in favor of political organizations like Morales´s Movement toward Socialism (MAS). Similar issues emerged in Ecuador where it was the indigenous organizations around CONAIE (Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador) that initiated mobilizations in the 1990s. These organizations brought down three presidents in the early 2000s who had attempted to introduce measures favoring the interests of global capital. Rafael Correa was elected to the presidency as a supporter of this new movement at the 2003 World Social Forum as “twenty-first-century socialism” and others described Through the first decade of the new century the promised changes began to be enacted. In Venezuela Cuban doctors staffed the new health service in the barrios Barrio Adentro. Public education was expanded and new housing initiatives inaugurated. In Bolivia the multinational and multilingual character of the new parliament reflected the arrival of the majority indigenous population to the center of political and cultural life from which they had been excluded through the preceding centuries. Oil and gas production was placed under public control and the revenues used to advance social programs. This did not go without opposition. The eastern provinces collectively known as the Half Moon ( where much of the country’s oil and agricultural wealth was concentrated and whose population was predominantly white and racist organized a systematic assault on the Morales government and laid siege to the constitutional convention. Morales supporters in the east were persecuted and killed and the ruling groups in the region (like their fellows in Ecuador around Guayaquil) threatened to divide the country. In any event the new constitution was passed in 2009 and Morales reached an agreement with the Media Luna to respect their economic interests in exchange for their recognition of his government. In Venezuela the opposition was expressed through the media and by the large-scale export of capital and running down of industry. The central issue facing the pink tide was how to break the dependence on a single export by diversifying the economy. Politically the question remained the meaning of national sovereignty and the relationship between the state and the movements from below on the one hand and between the national state and the global market on the other. How far could the nation-state exercise control over the global market? Or would the process be reversed and neoliberalism allowed to reclaim domination? Hugo Chavez died of cancer in early 2013. In his last written document a hard turn of the rudder arguing that the revolution had not succeeded in transforming the state. On the contrary the state seemed to have absorbed the revolution. His successor was elected in April that year with a bare majority. He did not have Chavez´s charisma nor his level of mass support process was starting to fail. In practice participatory democracy had given way to the domination of a party the United Socialist Party of Venezuela which Chavez had created in 2006 and which had become the apparatus of state power administering the system from above. Oil production was not increasing despite repeated assurances that it would prices for consumer goods were starting to increase and shortages were becoming noticeable. It was also becoming clear that a new bureaucracy in the state had inherited and continued a long tradition of corruption and this affected industry as well as public services. The public health services and the hospitals in particular were running short of medicines and equipment that were never delivered or were stolen. Military spending was rising and would do so at an increasing pace under Maduro. Widespread currency speculation was enabled by a system of providing importers with dollars at a very low exchange rate. Imported goods were then resold in Venezuela (or increasingly in Colombia) at black-market rates of exchange many hundreds of times the official rate. This raised the price of imported goods the more so since local production was grinding to a halt. Throughout 2014 the right organized opposition in the streets using burning barricades maintained by hooded youths to raise the political temperature. But when the right wing won a majority in the National Assembly the election was not an active vote for the bourgeois opposition but a warning shot to the government from a population frustrated by inflation and endless queues at supermarkets as well as by the government´s incapacity to control prices and stop speculation. neoliberal education reforms (essentially privatization) produced huge student demonstrations marked by both militancy and imagination. In 2013 mass protests erupted in Brazil around issues of public transport involving some two million people. In 2014 the demonstrators returned to protest the diversion of public funds to finance the World Cup and the Olympics at the expense of public services. Corruption was again a major issue and a sign that Lula´s public support was eroding. In 2015-2016 it was Dilma Rousseff Lula´s nominee for the presidency who came under public fire with renewed allegations of corruption. The resulting crisis opened the way for Jair Bolsonaro to shift the political spectrum to the far right with his overtly racist and sexist ideology. In Ecuador Rafael Correa was coming into direct conflict with the indigenous movement over concessions to foreign (mainly Chinese and Canadian) mining and oil companies. He accused them of “Pachamamismo”—Pachamama is the indigenous movement´s term for Mother Earth and refers to their concern with the conservation and protection of the environment against the rapacity of global capitalism. By the time of Correa´s resignation in 2017 it was becoming clear that neoliberalism had reclaimed its dominion in Latin America. In Ecuador and Colombia multinational corporations had returned to the mining industry and they dominated the agricultural sector in Brazil the confrontation between indigenous farmers and the Morales government over a decision to build a highway through indigenous communities called into question the nature of the project. The highway was essentially built to favor Brazilian export interests. Bolivia was also negotiating with Asian corporations for the exploitation of coltan and lithium deposits. But the emblematic case was in Venezuela where the Arco Minero project covering 12 percent of the country´s portion of the Orinoco River drainage basin was put up for sale to foreign companies wishing to exploit the enormous mineral and gold wealth of the area The protest movements continued and deepened. In Nicaragua the leader of the 1979 Sandinista revolution had created an effective dictatorship under the Sandinista name and signed a $40 billion contract for the opening of an interoceanic canal rob the country of its fresh water supply. When cutbacks and austerity measures were announced in 2018 mass protests were brutally repressed leaving 600 dead and thousands injured and detained by the Ortega regime. Yet he still claimed to represent twenty-first-century socialism. In Chile that year what began as a protest over increased transport prices became a more general protest over public health and education cuts and rising levels of poverty. In the following year repression became more brutal and police targeted tear gas at the eyes of demonstrators many of whom were blinded. In October that year a mass movement of resistance in Ecuador known as (The Explosion) brought together urban and indigenous movements in protest against new economic measures. The movement occupied Quito for two weeks. In Colombia police violence and the decline of public services as well as increasing poverty levels generated a huge protest movement in November (N-21). certainly stopped the protests in their tracks—partly because the initial lockdowns made mass gatherings impossible and were used by the state to demobilize the movements. And in part it was the sectors of the population who were involved in the protests that were most severely affected by the virus. In his study of viral outbreaks Mike Davis notes that defense against the new plagues requires “the suppression of [the] ‘structures of disease and emergence’ through revolutionary reforms … which no capitalist or state capitalist country can allow.” No such measure was taken in Latin America and the general conditions made it impossible to carry out when COVID arrived. With the exceptions of Uruguay and Costa Rica no Latin American country came even close to the World Health Organization’s recommended minimal spending on health of 6 percent of gross domestic product. Brazil under Bolsonaro now occupied third place in the number of deaths behind the United States and India. Trump and Bolsonaro have taken the same position of dismissing the reality of the virus both claiming it was no worse than the flu. In Nicaragua the Ortega dictatorship was cynical enough to claim that God would look after Nicaraguans and then to summon weekly street demonstrations under the banner of “Love in a Time of COVID.” Several members of Ortega´s government have died of COVID but numbers for the wider population are at best unclear. The most surprising and disturbing case of willful denial is Andrés Manuel López Obrador (Amlo) elected president of Mexico in 2018 as “the people’s candidate ” vowing to end corruption and restore public spending. His response to the virus has been to call for unity with Mexico´s capitalist class and delay measures for months. When asked by a journalist to explain his policy to contain the disease he produced an amulet—a lucky charm—as his reply. In each of these cases the cold reality is that these regimes have placed protecting the economy before protecting the people. When the virus hit 000 nurses short of what was needed by the public health system. Chile had no public health system at all. Peru and Colombia did take measures more rapidly but both had seen their public sector drained of resources through the preceding years. Bolsonaro has invited loggers into the Amazon bringing not only great harm to the biosphere but also bringing the disease to indigenous populations without medical services. Bolsonaro is a racist who has explicitly announced his lack of interest in the fate of Brazil´s indigenous communities. The Venezuelan crisis is a tragedy. This oil- and mineral-rich country whose Bolivarian revolution took 80 percent of its people out of poverty and promised to dedicate its oil revenues to the public good is in a state of collapse. The right-wing campaign led by Guaidó with enthusiastic support from Trump has done nothing at all in the face of COVID-19 and has no strategy to do more. Its erstwhile and probably future leader who is now in Spain has simply promised more violence along the lines of 2014.  Maduro has overseen a developing crisis that drove five million Venezuelans into exile has overseen shortages of basic foods and hunger in the streets and has permitted a scarcity of essential drugs and the destruction of public hospitals while electricity and water networks are at the point of collapse. The oil industry destroyed by technical and administrative failures is producing barely a fraction of what it produced ten years ago. Astronomical levels of inflation have made it virtually impossible to survive. The multiplying protests over the lack of petrol supplies and other shortages are dismissed as right-wing outcries and repressed. All this in a situation of rampant corruption and an increasingly authoritarian regime dominated by the military and using them to suppress resistance. It is true that the United States has used economic sanctions against Venezuela has financed the Guaidó campaign and has used every forum to denounce and intimidate Venezuela. But that is only part of the explanation for the current disaster which began before Trump. Most damning of all is the recent announcement of a new economic decree that effectively offers Venezuela´s oil and mineral resources for privatization a process that in practice began in 2016 with the Arco Minero the devastation caused by COVID has its causes in a global capitalist system which time and again set aside preparations for a possible future virus as Mike Davis points out. It has cut and undermined public health provisions and privatized essential services. The system has found resources to save its own as it did in 2008 but it will very soon come calling to demand that the victims pay the price. It is important that we are prepared and organized to resist armed with a clear vision of the kind of society that can address the needs of the many. This will not be preaching to empty stadiums. Hundreds of thousands of people joined protests and demonstrations across Latin America in the last three years alone demanding proper public services and a state that responds to their needs not the demands of the global market. In the enforced immobility of COVID the conversation has not ended. On the contrary the reality of climate change the consequences of environmental destruction the distortion of social priorities that puts profit over health and survival the absurdity of paying off debts to the very banks and financial institutions that caused the crisis in the first place are the topics of conversations everywhere. The idea of “ ”—a mode of life in equilibrium with the natural world that places quality above quantity that sees cooperation and solidarity as the central human values—has found its echo in the responses of grass-roots communities and organizations throughout the region. At the center of it all will be one demand: the right to health. It is a revolutionary demand because it addresses directly the prevailing values of the current order and of a socialist future. is Emeritus Professor of Latin American Studies at the University of Glasgow UK.

If you have bookmarks or links to our site on your blog or website Saint Cuthbert (c. 634 - 20 March 687) was an Anglo- who became the bishop of Lindisfarne and one of the most important saints of the in England. He first became a monk at Melrose c. 651 and later spent time in the communities at Ripon and Lindisfarne. He retired to the island of Farne around 676 to lead a life of solitude but was offered a bishopric in 684. He was reluctant to leave his hermitage but after a visit from King Ecgfrith (r. 679-685) himself Cuthbert was persuaded to accept the new position and was named bishop of Lindisfarne. Already renowned during his life for his miracles and piety Cuthbert became the patron saint of Northumbria. Cuthbert’s life is recounted in four important works dating to a decade or two after his death. Later narratives of his life are largely drawn from these works. The earliest of these was written by an anonymous monk of Lindisfarne probably no later than 705. Three others were written by and an account of Cuthbert’s life in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People . Both Bede and the anonymous Lindisfarne biographer draw on first-hand accounts from those who knew Cuthbert personally. Given the hagiographic nature of these works it can be difficult to separate the life of Cuthbert as a historical figure from the legends of his many miracles. Cuthbert was likely born c. 634 or 635 in the Kingdom of Northumbria. The precise location of his birth is uncertain though he seems to have spent his earliest years in Lothian and Lowland which was then Northumbrian territory. Very little is known about his family though there is some evidence to suggest he had a wealthy background. According to Bede he grew up behaving much as any other young child: playing games and wrestling with other boys. In his teenage years he worked as a shepherd and may have spent some time as a soldier. Cuthbert was eight years old when he began experiencing a series of miracles which ultimately led him to pursue his monastic career. Cuthbert was eight years old when he began experiencing a series of miracles which ultimately led him to pursue his monastic career. The first of these events occurred when a much younger child approached him and predicted that Cuthbert would one day be consecrated as a bishop and insisted that it was not at all fitting for him to behave like other children. Cuthbert took this child’s words to heart and made up his mind to lead a more serious life. Another miraculous event from Cuthbert’s youth involved a painful infection of his knee which grew so swollen that he could hardly walk. While Cuthbert suffered a rider approached him on horseback and told him how to treat his knee. Cuthbert followed the advice and soon his knee was restored. Afterwards Cuthbert realized that this rider had been an angel. In yet another episode Cuthbert encountered a crowd of onlookers taunting a group of monks caught adrift while rafting on the River Tyne. Rather than joining the jeering crowd Cuthbert knelt down and prayed for the deliverance of the monks who were in danger of drowning. As he prayed the wind turned and carried the men safely back to shore. One more miracle occurred in Cuthbert’s youth which seems to have been a final driving force behind his decision to join a . He and a few companions were tending a flock of sheep one night when he witnessed a bright light in the sky and a heavenly choir descending to earth before returning to heaven with a particularly dazzling soul. Cuthbert assured his companions that they must have seen the soul of some saint being led to heaven. The next morning the news arrived that Bishop Aidan of Lindisfarne had passed away that night. Cuthbert immediately decided to pursue a religious career returned the sheep to their owners and set off for Melrose to join the monastic community there. Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter! If Cuthbert really did arrive at Melrose shortly after Aidan’s death then his monastic career began in late 651. Bede notes that he arrived at Melrose on horseback and in the company of a servant which would seem to suggest an aristocratic upbringing. At Melrose Cuthbert first received instruction from Prior Boisil who apparently foresaw what a holy man Cuthbert would become. Not long after Cuthbert’s arrival arrived at Melrose. Boisil told Eata about Cuthbert’s potential and Eata granted permission for Cuthbert to receive the monastic tonsure. After approximately seven years at Melrose Cuthbert accompanied Eata and several other monks to a new monastery at Ripon which had recently been founded by King Ahlfrith of Deira (r. 655-664). At Ripon Cuthbert was given the title of guest-master and welcomed a stranger to the abbey whom he offered water for washing and food to eat. The guest at first refused the food but Cuthbert eventually persuaded him. When Cuthbert returned with the food he found the guest had gone but had not left any footprints in the snow and he found several perfectly baked loaves of bread. This proved that the guest had been an angel. Cuthbert succeeded him as Prior of Melrose & led his brethren in the observation of monastic rule. After King Alhfrith seized Ripon and made Wilfrid its new abbot Cuthbert and many other monks returned to Melrose with Eata. Cuthbert contracted a and lay stricken in bed with his brethren praying over him. When he awoke in the morning he learned that his companions had prayed for his recovery and quickly rose out of bed and resumed his duties. His strength returned to him gradually but the illness left him with a chronic pain in his right leg that troubled him for the rest of his life. Boisil predicted that Cuthbert would never again be stricken by illness but also predicted his own death. Following Boisil’s death Cuthbert succeeded him as Prior of Melrose led his brethren in the observation of monastic rule and worked vigorously to convert neighboring peoples to . Bede writes that many of the people living around Melrose were Christians in name only while others had totally reverted to paganism. Cuthbert traveled far and wide to preach even to the poorest and most remote villages. He would often be absent from Melrose for weeks at a time. Cuthbert’s reputation for piety and miracle-working seem to have caught the attention of Northumbrian royalty early in his career. When word of his piety reached the ears of Æbbe sister of King Oswiu of Northumbria (r. 642-670) she invited him to visit her at her own monastery near Coldingham. While at Melrose he also exorcised a demon who was tormenting the wife of a royal reeve. Eata transferred Cuthbert from Melrose to Lindisfarne off the coast of Northumbria north of the royal seat of Bamburgh. Eata was by then bishop of Lindisfarne and brought Cuthbert there possibly as a direct result of the Synod of Whitby. Prior to the synod tensions arose between conflicting factions in the Northumbrian church. At issue were a number of practices . Since the days of Saint Aidan (d. 651) practice which differed markedly from the practice promoted by now prominent clergymen including Wilfrid. At the synod King Oswiu sided with the Roman faction and many proponents of the Celtic tradition left the kingdom in protest. Eata and Cuthbert accepted the king’s decision and remained at Lindisfarne. Cuthbert still preached vigorously among the common people in addition to his other duties. He also performed a wide variety of miracles and his fame for doing so continued to spread. With prayer and suppressed fires. He was known to pray for hours even days at a time shunning sleep and weeping openly during services. After over a decade at Lindisfarne Cuthbert decided to retire to a life of solitude on Farne Island. According to Bede previous attempts to settle the island had failed as the place was haunted by demons who chased the newcomers away. Cuthbert was undeterred and built himself a dwelling on the island out of wood and stone. He constructed both a house to live in and a separate building to serve as an oratory. Bede writes that it would normally have taken several men to complete this work but that Cuthbert was aided by angels as he prepared his new home. People came from Lindisfarne and from all over to seek his aid with their troubles and afflictions. Among them was Ælflæd Abbess of Whitby and sister of King Ecgfrith (r. 670-685) who was then suffering from a dangerous illness that had left her unable to walk. Cuthbert sent her a girdle and when she put it on she found herself able to walk once more. Not long after Cuthbert later met Ælflæd in person on an island in the mouth of the River Coquet. Ælflæd asked Cuthbert how long her brother Ecgfrith would rule and he reluctantly predicted that Ecgfrith would be dead within a year. She despaired that there was no heir but Cuthbert reminded her of her half-brother Aldfrith then living in exile ""among the islands of the Irish"" (Colgrave 237). Cuthbert also foresaw his own elevation to the rank of bishop: ""I know that I am not worthy of such a rank; nevertheless I cannot escape anywhere from the decree of the Ruler of Heaven"" (Colgrave 237). Cuthbert was elected bishop at a synod presided over by King Ecgfrith and Theodore Archbishop of Canterbury. Cuthbert was reluctant but a delegation led by King Ecgfrith himself visited him at his hermitage and begged him to accept. Cuthbert was initially offered the bishopric of Hexham but exchanged episcopal sees with Eata. Cuthbert was consecrated at York by Archbishop Theodore in early 685. As bishop Cuthbert led by holy example. Bede writes: Gladly and diligently he practised his wonted frugality and rejoiced to preserve the rigours of monastic life. He gave food to the hungry and he was duly adorned with all else that should the life of a bishop. And signs and miracles whereby he shone outwardly gave witness to the inward virtues of his mind. (Colgrave 243) Not long after assuming the bishopric Cuthbert again prophesied the impending death of King Ecgfrith. While Ecgfrith led an army north against the Cuthbert visited the queen at a place called Lugubalia modern-day Carlisle. During his visit Cuthbert suddenly became troubled in spirit and declared that Ecgfrith had been killed and his army destroyed. News soon arrived that the Picts of Fortriu led by Bridei mac Bili (r. 672-693) had routed Ecgfrith’s forces at the of Dun Nechtain and that the king had indeed been killed. A short while later Ecgfrith’s half-brother Aldfrith succeeded him on the throne as Cuthbert had predicted. Cuthbert soon made another solemn prediction: that of his own approaching death. He had actually predicted his death as early as about 684 when discussing his elevation to the rank of bishop. According to Bede If He has determined to subject me to so great a burden I believe that after a short time He will set me free after not more than two years He will send me back to my accustomed rest and solitude. (Colgrave He predicted his death several more times in the years following the Northumbrian defeat at the Battle of Dun Nechtain. Meanwhile Cuthbert continued to perform a variety of other miracles as well. He cured the sick and witnessed another soul being carried to heaven. Knowing that his death was fast approaching Cuthbert resolved to return to his hermitage on Farne Island. Before he left one of his brethren asked when he would return. He replied: ""When you bring my body back here"" (Colgrave Cuthbert dwelt on Farne for another two months before falling gravely ill. He knew he was dying and he dictated his wishes to his companions for his . Even during his final illness he continued to miraculously heal his companions. He also exhorted them to continue to observe the Catholic rites particularly the celebration of Easter rather than reverting to the Celtic practice. Cuthbert passed away on 20 March 687. His body was taken by ship back to Lindisfarne where it was received by a host of his brethren and a choir of singers. He was placed in a stone sarcophagus beside the altar in the church of . The many miracles he had performed in life continued well after his death. The water used to bathe his body was mixed with soil and then used to cure a boy who had been tormented by a demon. Another man was cured of an illness after praying at his paralyzed from the waist down regained the use of his legs after Cuthbert’s shoes were put on his feet. A hermit on Farne Island was cured of horrific swelling and scabbing on his face after washing with a calfskin that had once belonged to the saint. Eleven years after his death Cuthbert’s tomb was opened so that the brethren of Lindisfarne could move his body. They found the body had not decomposed at all and that it looked as though Cuthbert was sleeping rather than deceased. Even the clothes he wore looked as new as if he had only recently been dressed in them. Bede mentions that Cuthbert was already regarded as a patron saint of Northumbria at the time of his Cuthbert is remembered by his biographers as a prolific miracle worker. Like many saints before him Cuthbert was renowned as a healer. He exorcised demons and restored the bodies of the lame or injured. Through prayer or through the blessing of food or drink Cuthbert cured all manner of illnesses. He also performed a number of miracles involving the sea and other bodies of water. He rescued the monks on the Tyne with prayer before he even received the monastic tonsure. One witness claimed to have seen him wade into the sea at night where ""he spent the dark hours of the night watching and singing praises to the sound of the waves"" (Colgrave otters appeared to dry him with their fur while he blessed them in return. Cuthbert interceded on more than one occasion during dangerous storms. One storm stranded Cuthbert and his companions while they traveled by boat. After praying they found cooked dolphin meat to eat and Cuthbert correctly predicted the storm would end in three days after which they continued their journey safely. Another storm stranded a group of visitors at his home on Farne Island for seven days until he intervened. Another common theme among Cuthbert’s miracles is communication with animals. He once correctly predicted that a passing eagle would return with food for him and his companions. On Farne when birds continually ate the crops he had planted he told them to stop unless they had God’s permission. After this they no longer bothered his crop. When ravens continually stole straw from the thatched roofs of his buildings Cuthbert commanded them to stop in the name of . Not only did the ravens stop but they also brought Cuthbert and his brethren lard from a hog to grease their shoes. Cuthbert’s cult was vigorously promoted by the Northumbrian church with the enthusiastic support of the royal family. Eadhbert probably Cuthbert’s immediate successor as bishop of Lindisfarne was buried in Cuthbert’s original as a sign of his love of the saint. Eadfrith who became bishop of Lindisfarne c. 698 commissioned three of the best-known lives of Saint Cuthbert. The first was likely that of the anonymous Lindisfarne author and the other two one written in prose and one in verse were both written by Bede. Eadfrith is also remembered for creating the Lindisfarne according to a later inscription on the book. It is likely that Bede himself is at least partially responsible for the spread of Cuthbert’s fame throughout Northumbria and beyond. Bede himself mentions that Cuthbert was already regarded as a patron saint of Northumbria at the time of his writing but Bede’s own prominence likely helped spread the cult’s fame farther still. In subsequent centuries rulers of the southern English kingdoms held Cuthbert in high esteem. (r. 871-899) began a long association between Cuthbert's cult and the royal family of Wessex after he was inspired by a vision of the saint during his struggles against the Danes. At least two of Alfred’s descendants Æthelstan (r. 924-927) and Edmund (r. 939-946) visited Cuthbert’s shrine bearing lavish gifts.

A motion was offered to first read petitions from the Virginia colony and others was denied. The bill was passed on February 17 approved by the Lords on March 8th and two weeks later ordered in effect by the King. The Stamp Act was Parliament's first serious attempt to assert governmental authority over the colonies. Great Britain was faced with a massive national debt following the That debt had grown from £72 789 in 1764*. English citizens in Britain were taxed at a rate that created a serious threat of revolt.

The difference between success and failure will not be in the formulation of job descriptions and compensation packages but in the ability to articulate a higher purpose. That begins with a clear sense of shared mission and values. Managers must clearly communicate their organization’s shared mission and hire people who will be inspired to dedicate their talents to it. The art of leadership is no longer merely to plan and direct action but to inspire and empower belief. Managers will face unprecedented challenges over the next decade. Not surprisingly many leaders will choose to focus on the strategic aspects of change. Just as important that can create teams diverse enough to be vibrant and innovative while remaining inclusive and cohesive enough to be effective. That’s easier said than done. also encounter obstacles and face resistance. Managers who attempt to reshape their workforce without first acknowledging the challenges of difference risk getting mired in conflict and acrimony What we have found in our work advising some of the world’s most high-performing firms on how to accelerate transformation and drive growth is that successful leaders strive to identify shared values and build change upon common ground. This means that managers need to not only evaluate technical skills but also to clearly communicate their organization’s shared mission and hire people who will be inspired to dedicate their talents to it. and advised their clients to focus on recruiting and retaining the “best and the brightest.” They suggested that firms should create compelling “employee value propositions and move quickly to get rid of C players. Yet it soon became clear that this approach because of unintended consequences that resulted from perverse incentives. In fact there is significant evidence that it the destructive culture and ultimate downfall of Enron because the focus on individual rather than team performance encouraged employees to undermine their colleagues. The lesson is that it is not individuals that get results — especially in high-value work such as there has been abundant research into how teams function best and what makes them perform most efficiently and productively. In one scientists at MIT and Carnegie Mellon found that high-performing teams are made up of people who have high social sensitivity who take turns when speaking But perhaps the most important trait of any team is that its members contribute a diversity of talents which maximizes the the number of possibilities the team can explore and leads to smarter building a diverse team that works well together is a challenge that takes real effort to overcome. Leaders shouldn’t underestimate it. is viewed as being in conflict with performance; something that leaders will get around to once they’ve made their quarterly numbers. However the evidence that diversity improves performance is nothing less than overwhelming. that diverse groups solve problems better than more homogenous teams of objectively high-ability problem solvers. Another that simulated markets that ethnic diversity deflated price bubbles. A that covered 366 public companies in a variety of countries and industries found that groups that were more ethnically and gender diverse performed significantly better than others. The list goes on. Yet while the benefits of diversity are clear so are the challenges. We are hard-wired to be hostile to those we see as “other.” In a randomly assigned to “leopards” and “tigers ” fMRI studies noted enmity to outgroup members. Similar results were found in can inhibit performance. Consider that when researchers at Northwestern’s Kellogg School of Management and Stanford Graduate School of Business put together groups of college students cohesive groups were much more able to come to consensus and feel confident in their solution than diverse groups but they were also much more likely to be wrong. Leaders need to be able to square the circle and build teams that are diverse enough to be innovative but cohesive enough to work together smoothly. Our work with high-performing organizations has shown that the best way to do that is by building a culture of strong Building a Shared Mission and Shared Values The link between values and performance isn’t always immediately obvious. But consider that culture and values are how an enterprise honors its mission and it becomes clear that values are a crucial component of Steve Jobs’ commitment to fusing design with technology was a value that attracted both customers and talent. More recently signaling a shift in values can help attract new domains of expertise. This was very much the case in the AI community which for decades prided itself on its meritocratic values. However when it became clear that the industry was encountering its commitment to taking those concerns seriously helped attract organizations such as the ACLU and Chatham House to its Yet what is crucial for leaders to understand is that commitment to values always comes with costs and constraints. Over a century one company we worked with has provided high-quality products and earned a reputation for ethics and excellence. Due to technological disruption the firm needed to hire people with more diverse skills and mindsets. leadership needed to have a frank discussion about how they needed to operate differently. Second they needed to signal to outsiders that the change was genuine. Managing the shift required a sustained commitment from the top to achieve the desired results. A High-Performance Culture Is a Journey values are how an enterprise honors its mission. To achieve any significant objective capabilities must be brought to bear and some of the most crucial capabilities are the skills embedded in an organization’s talent. However while skills enable an enterprise to achieve its mission they are separate and distinct from it. Values are central. There is a fundamental difference between hiring people to do what you want and hiring people who already want what you want. The value of any particular skill is people who share your mission and values can acquire the skills needed to achieve your shared objectives. What we’ve found in our work helping to develop high-performing organizations is that every strategy requires specific capabilities and those capabilities come with people attached. Those people come with their own needs and peccadilloes and dreams. The art of leadership is no longer merely to plan and direct action but to inspire and empower belief. every organization needs to attract and retain talent with diverse skills and perspectives.

1620764143.002717,32911965,https://www.ushistory.org/declaration/related/sugaract.html,When in the course of human events . . . The American Revenue Act of 1764 Parliament passed a modified version of the Sugar and Molasses Act (1733) which was about to expire. Under the Molasses Act colonial merchants had been required to pay a tax of six pence per gallon on the importation of foreign molasses. But because of corruption they mostly evaded the taxes and undercut the intention of the tax — that the English product would be cheaper than that from the French West Indies. This hurt the British West Indies market in molasses and sugar and the market for rum which the colonies had been producing in quantity with the cheaper French molasses. The First Lord of the Treasury and Chancellor of the Exchequer Lord Grenville was trying to bring the colonies in line with regard to payment of taxes. He had beefed up the Navy presence and instructed them to become more active in customs enforcement. Parliament decided it would be wise to make a few adjustments to the trade regulations. The Sugar Act reduced the rate of tax on molasses from six pence to three pence per gallon while Grenville took measures that the duty be strictly enforced. The act also listed more foreign goods to be taxed including sugar regulated the export of lumber and iron. The enforced tax on molasses caused the almost immediate decline in the rum industry in the colonies. The combined effect of the new duties was to sharply reduce the trade with Madeira and the French West Indies (Guadelupe Martinique and Santo Domingo (now Haiti)) all important destination ports for lumber and assorted farm products. The situation disrupted the colonial economy by reducing the markets to which the colonies could sell and the amount of currency available to them for the purchase of British manufactured goods.

We support unions and workers’ struggles throughout the world. We are committed to the advancement of the peace and anti-intervention movements. We stand in opposition to all forms of imperialism and oppression and we are uncompromising in our defense of the rights of women bisexuals and transgender people. The multiple ecological crises facing humankind are a new challenge that must be integrated into all our work. In our pages there is broad coverage of labor environmental struggles and the international scene as well as emphasis on cultural and intellectual history. Above all insists on the centrality of democracy to socialism and on the need to rely on mass movements from below for progressive social transformation. These are critical times. The forces of white supremacy are on the march. Not since before the New Deal have working-class people in this country been so vulnerable and perhaps never before have big business and the right been so aggressive and dominant. Right-wing populism is resurgent throughout Europe and in India. Brutal dictators and semi-dictators rule in Russia Hungary and a host of other countries. Abroad U.S. military and corporate power continues to grip the world. And above it all are the looming eco-crises that give new meaning to the slogan “socialism or barbarism.” There are hopeful signs: the rebirth of a socialist left a wave of teachers’ strikes a determined defense of immigrant rights and a growing climate movement demanding system change. The demand for a Green New Deal is a hopeful first step toward the kind of just transition we need to take. Not since the days of Eugene V. Debs has some version of the socialist idea been embraced by so many Americans. Yet on the whole the left remains too fragmented and too entangled in the corporate-dominated Democratic Party to pose a serious threat to the Establishment. seeks to revitalize the left and encourage its political independence as a step toward the creation of an international movement to replace capitalism as well as non-capitalist exploitative systems is not attached or subordinated to any political party or institution. We stand for popular empowerment and democratic control at every level opposition to all forms of authoritarianism no matter how leftist their rhetoric — in short was a beacon of principled socialist clarity.

If you have bookmarks or links to our site on your blog or website Etowah Mounds (also known as Etowah Indian Mounds) is a National Historic Landmark and archaeological site near Cartersville enclosing the ruins of a prehistoric Native American whose original name is unknown. The present designation of means ""town"" in the language of the Muscogee-Creek Native Americans. The city was built in three phases between c. 1000 - c. 1550 and the present site encloses three large and three smaller mounds surrounding a central plaza. The three large mounds were the chief’s residence (Mound A) the ceremonial site for religious rituals (Mound B) site for the nobility (Mound C); the smaller mounds are each attached or nearby the larger. Between the three was a plaza and as a ball field. The city was built and flourished during the period known as the Mississippian culture (c. 1100-1540 CE) when many of the best-known mound sites in North America – such as – were also constructed. The city seems to have developed from a small village community of the Woodland Period (c. 500 BCE - 1100 CE) whose inhabitants were related to those who built Etowah and the later Creek and Muskogee Native American tribes of the region who lived in and near the site. The Cherokee Nation arrived in the region from the north in the 15th century CE and settled at Etowah like many others in the area had their numbers depleted by European diseases they had no immunity to. The Creek and Cherokee remained on the land was discovered in the region and they were forcibly removed to Oklahoma by order of President Andrew Jackson (served 1829-1837) in the 1830s a tragic loss of land and heritage to the First Nations through the forced migration that has come to be known as the Trail of Tears. It is believed that Etowah is the most intact of the Mississippian culture mound sites of the southeast. The mounds were first noted by Americans in 1817 and test-sited in 1883 but no major excavations were begun until 1925 when the famous (or infamous) archaeologist Warren K. Moorehead (l. 1866-1939) arrived at the site. Moorehead’s work on Mound C – the most completely excavated area of the site to date – unearthed a number of significant artifacts which enabled the dating of the site to the Mississippian culture period. Excavations since Moorehead’s have been sporadic based on what has been found and the general preservation of the site that Etowah is the most intact of the Mississippian culture mound sites of the southeast built by the ancestors of the Muscogee-Creek Nation. The Mound Builders & Mississippian Culture The Mississippian culture is often cited as though it were the beginning of monumental mound-building but mounds were built thousands of years before in North America. Watson Brake Mounds dates to c. 3500 BCE and with the Mississippian culture’s mounds following. The Mississippian culture has become the best known and most closely associated with mound-building owing to the proliferation of mounds prior to that period and the skill of the people of the Adena culture (c. 800 BCE - 1 CE) and the Hopewell culture (c. 100 BCE-500 CE) who perfected mound-building and provided the model for later works such as the famous Mississippian Cahokia Mounds and Moundville. Map of Mississippian and Related Cultures Many mounds were constructed during the (c. 8000-1000 BCE) and the Woodland Period (c. 500 BCE - 1100 CE) but these differed from the later Mississippian culture sites in that those of the Adena were conical while those of the Hopewell were either effigy or flat-topped mounds. The Mississippian culture borrowed from both traditions in the creation of their mounds which were influenced by the religious beliefs spread throughout the region by the Hopewell culture. Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter! Native American religion took the form of animism – the belief that everything is animated by a spirit which lives on after the physical body has died and all things are connected in an intricate web of reciprocity – and it is thought the construction of the mounds was an expression of this belief. The people devoted themselves to the systematic removal of soil from one place to another for the greater good of the community in honoring the spirits of a given place and raising their chief and/or priests to a higher level which was considered a god. This could be considered an act of reciprocity in that the people were providing a “home” for the spirits focusing the energy of those spirits for the good of the community and then giving back to the spirits through ritualistic ceremonies. To commune with the spirits and gods the people needed to alter how they experienced the world around them and this was accomplished through rituals which might have included the act of mound-building but certainly involved the mounds themselves which elevated participants. Hallucinogens in the form of especially strong tobacco cultivated by the Adena and Hopewell early on and then by the Mississippian culture are also thought to have played a part in this communion. Scholar Charles C. Mann comments: The Hopewell apparently sought spiritual ecstasy by putting themselves into trances perhaps aided by tobacco. In this enraptured state the soul journeys to other worlds. As is usually the case people with special abilities emerged to assist travelers through the portal to the numinous. Over time controlling access to the supernatural realm. They passed on their control and privileges to their children creating a hereditary priesthood: counselors to kings if not kings themselves. They acquired healing lore learned the numerous divinities in the Hopewell . We know little of these gods today because few of their images have endured to the present. Presumably shamans recounted their stories to attentive crowds; almost certainly they explained when and where the gods wanted to build mounds. In the context of the village was as much a beacon as a medieval cathedral. As with Gothic churches which had plazas for the outdoor performance of sacred mystery plays the mounds had greens before them: ritual spaces for public use. (294-295) The mound sites of the Mississippian culture – as well as those constructed earlier such as Poverty Point – follow this model. It is also likely that the people of the Mississippian culture also used tobacco to alter consciousness as that was one of the crops they raised and squash. These crops were used in paying laborers for building mounds and other tasks as well as in often across vast distances. Mound B at Etowah seems to have been used for rituals but artifacts from the plaza below Mound A suggest the same for that area. It is possible Mound A which supported the chief’s residence was also considered the home of the spirits of the place and the plaza served as the primary place for honoring them in rituals. How the mounds were used is actually still not entirely clear as so little of the site has been excavated but what is clear is that Etowah Mounds are among the best representations of the work of the Mississippian culture featuring three flat-topped mounds surrounding the central plaza. As noted the site was completed in three phases during the different periods of the Mississippian culture: The location & height of the mounds seem to honor the chief & the departed in descending order of largest-to-smallest mounds. The city is thought to have developed from an earlier village on the site associated with the Swift Creek Culture who were mound builders of the Middle Woodland Period and created the Leake Mounds two miles west of Etowah. The Swift Creek peoples like many early mound builders were hunter-gatherers who devoted a significant amount of time to constructing their mounds and then abandoned them and moved on. This certainly seems to be the case with the Leake Mounds as the site was abandoned c. 650 CE and at Etowah as well since artifacts found on site suggest the earlier Swift Creek village was abandoned c. 600 CE. Whether the Swift Creek began any of the mounds presently at Etowah is unknown as only Mound C has been excavated to any significant degree but this is a possibility. The location and height of the mounds seem to honor the chief and the departed in descending order of largest-to-smallest mounds although this claim is speculative and the size may have nothing to do with the significance. Mound A – site of the chief’s residence – is 63 feet (19 m) tall and was once topped by four buildings surrounding a courtyard. Mound B – site of religious rituals – is 25 feet (7.6 m) tall and seems to have had temples on it. Mound C – a burial mound – rises 10 feet (3 m) tall and also had a Mound A is situated directly before the central plaza of the city with the other two mounds off to the side. The chief of the community was early on known by the title ""Brother of the Sun"" and was thought to be able to commune directly with the sun god. His mound at Etowah is the highest to elevate him closer to his “brother” in the sky and enable more direct communication. The ceremonies enacted on Mound B may have been funerary rituals associated with Mound C The lower-class lived in wood and thatch homes surrounding the plaza and the mounds and there seem to have been industrial and commercial structures in that area as well. To date 140 structures have been identified at the site through postholes and by using magnetometers which can detect anomalies under the ground which and walls. By using magnetometers archaeologists can avoid disturbing the surfaces of the mounds and plaza. Magnetometers have also identified a palisade and a moat which encircled the site on three sides the fourth side open to the Etowah River. The palisade featured watchtowers spaced at intervals of 80 feet (24 m) from the opening on the river in a semicircle ending back at the river on the far side. The people engaged in long-distance trade which brought raw materials not sourced locally which was used to create the famous Etowah Statues paired figures of a man and woman thought to have been used as effigies in religious rituals honoring the peoples’ ancestors. Daily life centered around hunting and tending crops as well as working on the mounds Among the most popular of the latter were ball games one of which resembled modern-day lacrosse and the other a game called 'chunkey' in which players would throw carved sticks toward a rolling disk trying to have their sticks land as close to the disk’s final resting place as possible; the player whose stick was closet scored the point and the first to reach 12 points was the winner. Chunkey was taken quite seriously and large bets seem to have been made on the game based on later reports by European explorers with losers sometimes opting for suicide rather than live with the loss and attendant shame involved. The site was still inhabited in 1540 when the Spanish conquistador Hernando De Soto (l. c. 1500-1542) arrived in the area in search of gold. De Soto’s reports include mention of a village they called Itaba (translated as “boundary”) which later scholars have associated with Etowah. De Soto’s small army of 550 men dogs ravaged the area as they were convinced the natives were hiding huge quantities of gold. Scholar James Wilson notes: The Indians signaled De Soto’s approach with a relay of beacon-fires but they were unable to stop the expedition which left a trail of desecrated temples and razed towns in its wake. (135) De Soto died of “Old World Fever” while still searching the region for gold and the pathogens of whatever this European disease was spread among the natives who had no natural immunity to them. Between European-borne disease and the wholesale slaughter of villages who ""refused to give up their gold"" the population of the region was greatly reduced overall and this same most likely happened at Etowah. De Soto’s chroniclers report him ordering the destruction of villages and towns where ""the cries of the and children were such as to deafen those who pursued them"" (Wilson and it is possible this same policy was engaged in at Etowah. American Discovery & Removal of Tribes Whatever happened to the original inhabitants who claimed ancestral ties to Etowah were living at the site in the late 15th century CE when the Cherokee are thought to have arrived from the Great Lakes region to the north. By 1800 the Cherokee had long been settled and were the tribe to introduce Americans to Etowah. The first American report concerning Etowah comes from the minister Elias Cornelius (l. 1758-1823) an evangelist to the natives who traveled the region converting them to and establishing schools to 'civilize' them. Cornelius engaged with the Cherokee near Etowah who brought him to the site in 1817. He recorded the event and an admiring description of the mounds in his journal but this was not published until 1833. the Georgia Gold Rush (c. 1829-1840) was well underway and speculators rushed to the region in hopes of becoming wealthy. Cornelius’ account of Etowah even if any of them had read it would not have changed anything as the Americans had long followed a policy of disrespecting Native American traditions and land rights and certainly would not have paused at this point to consider the ancient claim the natives had to the land especially when gold was involved. By 1830 there were thousands of miners along the Etowah River and the Muscogee-Creek fought back against the influx of immigrants. President Andrew Jackson responded to the mounting tensions by signing the Indian Removal Act of 1830. Although the Creek and others appealed to the Supreme Court to keep the lands they lost their case and were removed to Oklahoma and other points west. This forced migration of over 60 000 Native Americans is known as the Trail of Tears because of the number of natives who died on the march as well as the loss of their lands to greedy speculators who once they had exhausted the gold veins abandoned the area for the next one promising riches. Thomas (l. 1825-1910) and archaeologist John P. Rogan (c. 1880s) made the first test excavations at Etowah for the Smithsonian Institute. Rogan plates now known as the Etowah Plates as well a number of other artifacts now on exhibit at the Smithsonian. The first full-scale excavation of the Etowah site was not initiated until 1925 under the direction of Warren K. Moorehead who is both praised and criticized for his work at Etowah and elsewhere. Moorehead was consistently object-oriented and he frequently engaged in destructive measures in his quest for museum-worthy artifacts. He worked four seasons at Etowah concentrating on Mound C which rewarded his efforts with a number of significant finds. When mounds A and B failed to do the same only 9 percent of the site has been excavated and cataloged in spite of periodic digs from Moorehead’s time to the present. Today Etowah is protected as a National Historic Landmark and is open to the public as an archaeological park. The on-site museum contains artifacts excavated from the mounds and the surrounding area and also offers interactive displays on the history of the Native Americans who built the great mounds and lived in the area for thousands of years before the arrival of the European immigrants whose descendants now occupy the land surrounding the site.

It afflicts employees in every type or work whether they’re sitting at desks or lifting heavy objects. And it costs employers lost workdays and medical expenses on surgeries Annual health care costs for chronic back and joint pain hit $380 billion in 2016 according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. And both employees and managers are aware of its impact. Ninety percent of surveyed employees say people who experience chronic physical pain are more likely to be anxious and depressed Harvard Business Review Analytic Services survey report “The Future of Digital Care: Tackling the Costs of Physical and Emotional Pain in the Workplace .” While 81% of those surveyed say employers could do more to help people with chronic pain one in three feels the topic is taboo at work. These findings highlight a gap in health care benefits that could help employees prevent and resolve chronic pain. There’s an information gap too: 81% of managers in the survey said it’s hard to know when their employees are in chronic pain and that they often find out only when employees miss work. traditional methods of treating chronic back and joint pain are often expensive and ineffective involving opioid prescriptions or injections and even surgeries that can carry price tags of up to $150 that surgery is not the most effective way to treat the pain). Best practice research highlighting the complexity of chronic pain suggests that a more holistic approach addressing lifestyle changes is more effective. This lifestyle-medicine approach is how I treat my patients as a physician. But lifestyle changes are behaviorally complex. According to the report “the most striking development in our knowledge about how to deal with back pain and other pain is understanding the importance of physiological and social factors senior investigator emeritus at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute. Patients who receive mind-body therapies along with their regular medical care had less pain and improved mental health compared to those who did not get those therapies and other behavioral changes also reduced chronic back and joint pain How can employers fill this gap in health care benefits for their employees with a more holistic digital approach to chronic back and joint pain? a food service distributor with $28 billion in annual revenue to offer a virtual option pairing physical therapy with behavioral health coaches is free to participants and does not require copays or deductibles. The company made the Digital Musculoskeletal Clinic available to members by mailing employees free tablet computers and such supportive equipment as yoga mats and exercise bands all at no out-of-pocket cost to participants. By allowing employees to do their exercise therapy at home using an app and wearable sensor technology and pairing them with a full virtual clinical team US Foods helped its employees reduce weight and stress—and ultimately resolve their chronic pain. by 50% for back and neck pain and 55% for musculoskeletal surgery compared with employees who did not participate. Participants also reported having less pain Taking Virtual Care to the Next Level The report found that while many employers offer basic virtual care options such as virtual doctor visits and mental-health counseling less than half of the responding employees indicated they were aware of available such as apps and wearable technology. The gap was the largest for physical therapy: 60% of respondents said their employers offer in-person physical therapy but only 15% indicated they have access to virtual physical therapy options. more employers could and should provide next-level digital care options for chronic physical pain that drive better outcomes at lower costs. which pairs advanced wearable technology with a comprehensive clinical care team including doctors of physical therapy is already available to millions of employees at Boeing and US Foods.

Category tags are usually added at the very bottom of the page for the convenience of other editors. categories are displayed in the Categories: box strictly in the order they appear in the wikitext. under the first list each category is listed again with all its parent categories sorted alphabetically.
(At least in MediaWiki 1.18.2) if a category is a subcategory of more than one parent both hierarchies will be listed but the tagged category will be stripped off all but one of these.
This creates the potential for what appear to be duplicate entries if a category with multiple parents one of its parents are both tagged on a page.

Since category pages are much like any other page a Category tag may be added to the bottom of a category page. It is a good idea to organize all categories into a hierarchy with a single top level category. The category structure can take the form of a tree with separate branches but more often will have a graph structure. Generally there should be a contiguous chain of parent-child links between each category and the top level category. to provide a tree-like structure display for the categories.

If you have bookmarks or links to our site on your blog or website from 306-337 CE and is known to history as in 312 CE and his subsequent Christianization of the . His conversion was motivated in part by a vision he experienced at the invading barbarians. Numerous Roman generals had fought over the rule of the empire resulting in civil wars and the rule of the so-called who were chosen and often quickly replaced by the (r. 284-305) divided the empire into East and West and appointed co-emperors. Beneath the co-emperors he appointed Caesars and Augusti to delegate Roman rule. Constantine’s father was one of the Caesars of the . Diocletian then took the unprecedented step of retiring to his villa at Split (modern-day Croatia) in 306 CE. The night before meeting at the Milvian Bridge either in a vision or a dream Constantine saw an image with the ""In Hoc Signo Vinces"" (""In this sign When Constantius and his son battled the Constantius was killed near York in 306 CE and the legions proclaimed Constantine Augustus on the field. With the retirement of Diocletian the next several years saw civil wars in both the East and the West over who would become the sole ruler of the empire. Constantine’s opposition in the West was Maxentius and their armies met near the Milvian Bridge in Rome a bridge across the northern outskirts on the Via Flaminia. Maxentius fell into the river (with his armor) and drowned. Constantine became the sole ruler in the West. The night before meeting at the Milvian Bridge Constantine prayed for success in the coming battle. Either in a vision or a dream he saw an image with the script "" conquer""). Controversy still swirls around both the event and the image that he saw. We have two sources for the story: Eusebius (260-340 CE) and Lactantius (Lucius Caecilius Caecilius Firmianus 250-325 CE) a court adviser and tutor to his sons. Both these men related the story but only years after the event. Eusebius reported that Constantine saw the sign of the cross while Lactantius said it was the superimposed letters chi and rho (the first two letters of 'Christ' in ). Whatever Constantine saw or experienced he credited his victory to the Christian God. Bibliothèque Nationale de France (Public Domain) Although Constantine is acclaimed as the first emperor to embrace Christianity he was not technically the first to legalize it. In the 3rd century CE various generals issued local edicts of toleration in an effort to recruit Christians into the legions. These edicts then fell by the wayside when the contender was killed in battle. Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter! Galerius (r. 305-311 CE) initially had persecuted Christians but reversed it through the Edict of Toleration in Serdica in 311 CE. Licinius (r. 308-324 CE) had also persecuted Christians sporadically but took the edict of Galerius as a model and met with Constantine in Milan to unify positions. The Edict of Milan was issued in 313 CE with the added stipulation that Christian property that had been confiscated or destroyed would be returned or compensated with funds. (""endurance"") is often used to describe Rome’s position vis-à-vis the numerous native cults. However there was no official policy and what was tolerated was the religious pluralism; everyone respected the gods of others. Rome had a system of who met for shared meals under the auspices of a god or goddess. To meet the group had to have permission but it was actually coined by Bishop Tertullian (2nd century CE) in his petition for such a license for Christian meetings. His petition was denied at the time. The Edict of Milan now granted Christians throughout the Empire toleration and permission to meet in their assemblies and so legalized the movement. Christianity was now just one more of the thousands of native cults throughout the Empire. Scholars continue to debate and examine the rationale for Constantine’s conversion to Christianity. One element involves attempts to determine the demographics of the Roman Empire c. 300 CE. Christianity had grown steadily since the 1st century CE there are estimates that out of a total population of 60 million 3 million were Christians. (Jews still numbered 11 million). Some contend that Constantine was smart enough to foresee the winds of change. However Constantine may have perhaps been pre-programmed for some of his beliefs. (r. 270-275 CE) the cult of Sol Invictus (""the invincible unconquered sun"") was promoted as his family cult. This cult also embodied concepts of . Sol Invictus merged with another popular military cult that of Mithras. At the same time Aurelian also reorganized imperial finances and regulated imports and the price of food throughout the provinces. His ideals may be summarized as ""one god one empire"". Constantius and his son Constantine were both members of the cult of Sol Invictus. Constantine was most likely exposed to Christian teachings in his travels with his father. It was reported that he helped some Christians receive compensation for damaged property near Trier before his conversion. He also spent time and received his education in various imperial courts (particularly under Diocletian). We cannot confirm if his mother was a Christian before her son’s conversion; such details are only found in later Many books on Constantine continue to debate Constantine’s commitment as a Christian. Criticism of Constantine's conversion involves the following elements: The Edict of Milan legalized Christians but left all the native cults in place. The Arch of Constantine (erected in 315 CE near the ) lacks Christian symbols and contains sculptures of offerings to Apollo Constantine issued coins with himself in the figure of Sol Invictus and Helios. Constantine was not baptized as a Christian until he was on his deathbed. Whether any of the above points can be interpreted as a lack of commitment is debated. Constantine inherited a vast empire where he expected loyalty from all citizens. He could not abruptly eliminate the old the traditions of the ancestors which were incorporated into daily life. The native cults would not be outlawed until the edict of Theodosius I in 381 CE. of Constantine was commissioned by the Roman Senate in 315 CE to celebrate his victory over Maxentius. Scholars debate if the arch was built utilizing older arches to to explain the incorporation of these symbols. We do not know how many Christians were in the Senate at that time but the Senate was always a conservative body. All emperors promoted their family cults on their coins. However we cease to find such coins after 319 CE for unknown reasons. In 321 CE Constantine forbade Christians to make offerings at native temples. In reorganizing fiscal policy he had many of the native statues melted down to mint new coins. The most debated topic of Constantine’s conversion is his baptism. Given the civil wars that were rampant in this period the best explanation is that Constantine knew that as emperor he was going to have blood on his hands. In this sense he was quite typical. He executed one of his wives and their son (possibly because of rumors of sexual immorality). Waiting to the very end to have your sins forgiven made perfect sense in his world. Despite the delay of baptism throughout his reign Constantine was quite open about his Christian convictions in his letters and speeches: This God I invoke with bended knees and recoil with horror from the blood of sacrifices from their foul and detestable odors and from every earth-born magic fire: for the profane and impious superstitions which are defiled by these rites have cast down and consigned to perdition many whole nations of the Gentile world. (Eusebius While native cults and traditions remained Constantine favored Christians both financially and theologically. As their supreme patron Constantine endowed Christians with funds to build their basilicas and to acquire property named Christians to high-ranking offices and exempted Christian clergy from taxes. In theological support his position as head of the Church as well as the empire contributed to imperial dictates that promoted Christian unity of belief. Constantine expanded the ideas of Aurelian in that he could now enforce ""One God During the persecution against Christians under Diocletian (302-306 CE) the emperor had ordered Christian clergy to hand over their sacred texts. To avoid imprisonment and the arenas had done so. Divisions had grown among the Christian communities was adamant that these bishops were now defiled. The bishops petitioned Constantine to act as a mediator in this problem. After so many civil wars Constantine was determined to instill unity throughout the Roman Empire and ordered a policy of ""forgive and forget."" Bishop Donatus refused and his followers settled in North a hundred years later. By issuing the order Constantine effectively became the official head of the Church. This mirrored Augustus (r. 27 BCE - 14 CE) when he combined the position of pontifex maximus the head of Roman religion with his role as first citizen. In 324 CE Constantine defeated Licinius and became the sole emperor. In that position he essentially expanded the ideas of Aurelian in that he could now enforce ""One God his next major challenge came in 325 CE. A presbyter in had been teaching that at some point God had created Christ. Riots had broken out in several and Constantine brought the bishops together at the of Nicaea to resolve the issue. The Council of Nicaea resulted in the Christian doctrine known as the which articulated the relationship between God and Christ. The Council voted to claim that Christ was of the identical essence of God and manifest (incarnated) on earth in the now Christian emperor stands in for Christ and so carries the identical power of God on earth as he rules. It was after this council that Christian emperors began to be portrayed with halos over their heads and the trappings of divine worship. The concept of a creed (from the Latin ""I believe"") was a Christian innovation. With multiple native cults there was no central authority that dictated what all should believe. The Nicene Creed formalized one system of belief that was promoted through the power of the emperor. As such any dissent was not only heresy but also treason. The Council of Nicaea also set the date for the empire-wide celebration of . Some communities had insisted on following the gospel tradition of observance during the Jewish Passover. Constantine allegedly wrote: ... it appeared an unworthy thing that in the celebration of this most holy feast we should follow the practice of the Jews who have impiously defiled their hands with enormous sin deservedly afflicted with blindness of soul ... Let us then have nothing in common with the detestable Jewish crowd; for we have received from our Savior a different way. (Eusebius Constantine elected the practice which churches in Rome followed: the first Sunday after the first full moon following the spring solstice. The later codes under Theodosius I (r. 379-395 CE) and (r. 527-565 CE) claimed that Constantine also created legislation against the Jews: Jews could not seek converts were forbidden to own Christian slaves and could not circumcise their slaves. Christians who converted to Jewish clergy were offered the same tax exemptions as Christians. Constantine is often credited with determining the date for Christmas although no edict has survived. Christians in Rome celebrated the event during the festival of in December. 25 December was also the birthday of Sol Invictus and Mithras and may have been utilized in attempts to unify these festivals. From an ancient calendar we know that in the year 336 CE the celebration was established on 25 December. The first 300 years of Christianity were dominated by the existence of multiple communities that articulated their beliefs in various ways; until Constantine there was no central authority to determine dogma and ritual. In the 2nd century the writings of the Church Fathers produced what eventually became Christian dogma. Many of the same ideas are evident in Constantine’s letters and speeches. The same Church Fathers had invented the concept of orthodoxy (correct belief) against other views which were considered heresy. Under Constantine heresy was defined in relation to these earlier Christian views. The property of heretics was confiscated and their execution was by burning at the stake. The Church Fathers had determined that only and John contained the correct teaching and many scholars believe those four found in the later Codex Sinaiticus (an early version of the Originating as a sect of Judaism Christians initially held to the ban on images. During the reign of Constantine Christian art began to flourish particularly with the craft of mosaics. As patron of the Church Constantine provided funds for artists and artisans and allegedly had the imperial symbol of either the chi-rho or the cross painted on the legions’ shields. Christian tradition credits Constantine with creating the cross as a religious symbol after outlawing crucifixion as a means of execution. No official edict has survived; it comes from the later Christian historian Salminius Hermias Sozomenus (400-450 CE) He regarded the cross with peculiar reverence on account both of the power which it conveyed to him in the battles against his enemies and also of the divine manner in which the symbol had appeared to him. He took away by law the crucifixion customary among the Romans from the usage of the courts. He commanded that this divine symbol should always be inscribed and stamped whenever coins and images should be struck which exist in this very form still testify to this order. (Sozomen Constantine continued the standard practice of building monuments and basilicas (public buildings). Their characteristic shapes helped form the standard of churches with a nave and apses for side altars. In Rome Constantine built the first basilicas of St. Peter and St. John in Lateran. His new imperial city was famous for its imperial architecture. made a pilgrimage trip to . There she claimed to have discovered the sites associated with including the ""true cross"". Constantine then constructed The Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem and The Church of the Holy Sepulcher (housing the Constantine also built the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople. In his will he wished to be buried there as the thirteenth apostle. The church survived there is no doubt that Constantine's combining of church and state contributed to the further growth of Christianity and the evolution of its theology. Constantinople became the seat of the which ruled throughout the Middle East until the The Age of Constantine the Great.

The End of the American Century Volumes and volumes of written work was emerging in the American colonies on the subject of British policies. Apart from major documents and publications much writing had been produced as letters and newspaper editorials. The arguments set forth in this way were at times very convincing. American patriots of the 1770s did not have modern means of communication at their disposal. To spread the power of the written word from town to town and colony to colony The first such committee was organized by none other than Samuel Adams. Working with rural patriots Adams enabled the entire Massachusetts citizenry to have access to patriot text. In fact Adams knew that the residents of the seacoast towns were more informed of each crisis than those of the interior. The spread of these committees across urban centers happened quickly. Adams and others urged the establishment of correspondence committees in rural inland towns as well. The Committees of Correspondence were bold enough to use the British postal service as the means of communication. For the most part the pen was their weapon of choice but revolutionary sentiment did at times take other forms. For example the Committee of Correspondence in Boston gave its blessing on the raiding of the Dartmouth and the destruction of its cargo that became known as the . As the revolution drew nearer the committees became the spine of colonial interaction. The Virginia House of Burgesses followed Adams' lead and established a Committee of Correspondence as a standing committee in 1773. Before the Tea crisis had passed each colony had a central committee designed to coordinate discussion with the other twelve colonies. In effect these Committees of Correspondence were the forebears to the First and Second Continental Congresses. The Provincial Committees of Safety of the American Revolution devoted to Committees of Safety was written by a Professor in 1904 and was intended for the serious history student. If that's you and you want to get a deep understanding of what these committees were all about and how they went about their business then gallop to this site now. Remember: Safety First!

The debate around them has been going on for years. I have been involved in it and have spilled gigabytes of electronic ink in polemics around it. Instead of tediously repeating myself in responding to comrade bean let me summarize my position and provide some links to articles in which I have set it out in detail and which readers are invited to consult. Let me start by agreeing with comrade bean regarding the characterization of the Hebrew (‘Israeli-Jewish’) working class: its politics on Zionist colonization are largely reactionary as it is complicit in it and has no immediate interest in combating it. against the Zionist regime in the present circumstances this by no means excludes the possibility of winning over small numbers of Hebrew workers to a revolutionary socialist position. Our experience in Matzpen is proof of this. let me also point out that there are lots of cases of joint struggle and solidarity of Israeli workers of both national groups on direct in strikes etc. There is a relatively new but very active successful and growing trade union organisation . This is something positive to build on. I am sure comrade bean and I agree that a necessary condition for a benign resolution of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict is the overthrow of the Zionist regime. Can this be achieved without the support – let alone against a determined opposition – of the Hebrew working class? I argue that the answer to this question is No! Indeed the idea that a benign resolution of the Israeli–Palestinian colonial conflict can be imposed by force on the Hebrew working class and generally on the Hebrew masses is an extremely dangerous illusion and socialists should not condone But is the Hebrew working class going to support the Zionist regime Are there any circumstances in which it may take a class position against this regime? In that article I argue that there is a scenario in which the Hebrew working class would turn against the Zionist regime. I elaborate this further in (see in particular the final part of this article). I also point out manifestations of Hebrew solidarity with the Egyptian and Syrian workers. The question of Hebrew self-determination should be viewed in this context One essential point that emerges from all this is that it is a mistake to think of this conflict and its possible resolution in a rigid static way and within the ‘box’ of Israel/Palestine. It is essential to think of it dialectically and within a regional context. It also requires long-term strategizing and organizational preparation. We must on no account give up in advance on the prospect of joint struggle. born in Tel Aviv in 1936 is a mathematician and socialist activist who has been active in and written extensively on Middle-Eastern politics. In 1962 he co-founded the Israeli socialist organisation . He has taught mathematics in Israel  and mathematics and philosophy in the UK. Together with Shimon Tzabar and others he established the Israeli Revolutionary Action Committee Abroad.

If you have bookmarks or links to our site on your blog or website A Gallery of Ancient Japanese Pagodas we look at some of the most famous pagodas in many of which are classified as National Treasures. Pagodas are tall multi-storied structures which traditionally featured as part of complexes. The tallest wooden example is the 55-metre or 179-foot tall pagoda at in Kyoto which has five stories and was first built in the 9th century CE. Not only striking architectural features pagodas were designed to house important Buddhist relics as well as celebrated related sculptures and paintings. Many of the pagodas are built entirely of wood sometimes without the use of nails and their designs have proved remarkably resistant to earthquakes thanks to their internal inter-locking structures. otherwise known as the ‘Temple of the Pure Water Spring’ the Koyasu pagoda was built in the early 17th century CE. published on 17 May 2019 under the following license: .

1620764225.153601,22719147,https://hbr.org/podcast/2021/05/296801-2,How To Talk Yourself Up (Without Turning People Off) A conversation with HBS associate professor Leslie John about how to best take credit for your wins associate professor at Harvard Business School has done some deep research into the ways that people self-promote in their professional lives and identified what works and what doesn’t. She says it is possible tout your own accomplishments without annoying your colleagues if you do it at the right time or enlist others to boast on your behalf. She notes that many common workarounds — such as humblebragging — are highly ineffective and advises people to not only look for more natural opportunities to self-promote but also try to present balanced views of themselves. She’s full of tips you can put to work even in virtual settings. John is the author of the HBR article “ ALISON BEARD: Welcome to the HBR from Harvard Business Review. I’m Alison Beard. most of us know that doing good work isn’t always enough to get you ahead in your career. Colleagues and bosses need to recognize what you’re accomplishing for it to really matter. Hopefully they notice on their own but you can’t count on that which means you need to learn how to self-promote. I know what some of you are thinking right now I hate people who brag about themselves. I can’t imagine doing it myself.” Other listeners might have the opposite reaction. You’re saying I’m pretty good at letting people know about all the amazing things I’ve done ” and you’re probably the ones that everyone else hates. So where is the happy medium? How can those nervous about self-promotion get better at it and how can natural braggarts find more subtle ways to showcase themselves? Our guest today has answers. She’s studied all the different ways people draw attention to their own achievements and figured out which are most effective. Leslie John is a professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School and the author of the HBR article thanks for coming to the show. LESLIE JOHN: Thanks for having me. ALISON BEARD: So how did you get interested in self-promotion? it’s because I was a little tired of rolling my eyes at people just shamelessly self-promoting themselves it feels like it’s even more rampant and it’s just such a cringe-worthy behavior. And I also think that in a way I feel sorry for those that are so blatantly self-promoting because it’s not helpful to them either. So I wanted to write a piece that unofficially call A Canadian’s Guide to Bragging to help people juggle this balance this communication dilemma that we face when we’re trying to self-promote. That is we want to convey our strengths and our accomplishments. We want people to be aware of them but the bind is that when we do that we often come across as egotistical And the thing is these negative inferences that people have they can even get in the way of what you’re trying to do in the first place because bragging doesn’t even always work. It doesn’t even always make you seem more competent. So I wanted to write a piece to see what we can learn from behavioral science on how to do it better. ALISON BEARD: Why is blatant bragging so bad? Because sometimes it seems like the people who self-promote in pretty obvious ways do get ahead. It works for them. LESLIE JOHN: The studies that have looked at whether self-promotion actually pays off I would say mixed at best picture on whether it’s effective. So when we look at actually controlled experiments where people are asked to for example read a transcript from a job interview. And in one of the transcripts the person is super forthcoming about promoting themselves even when not solicited and another person is more humble raters actually rate the person who is more humble as someone they would rather work with but also someone who is potentially going to be a better fit for the job. So it doesn’t even necessarily pay off all the time to self-promote. That’s not to say that it’s not important that others are aware of our successes. It absolutely is important for others to know about them. But I think there’s a lot more subtlety to how we should communicate that. ALISON BEARD: Knowing that humility is a trait that people value what’s the argument against just putting your head down and doing good work and expecting it to be recognized? It’s just unrealistic? so my general advice is just that is to nose to the grindstone earn recognition through consistent performance. And you’re not going to always be recognized for every single thing you do. But over time chances are our successes and our performance and our contributions will be recognized. Now I want to immediately qualify it and I don’t want to sound trite in suggesting that because there are some very real barriers that people face to being recognized. One prime example of that is there are biases in our perceptions of people’s contributions to projects. So underrepresented minorities it’s sad but true that we we tend to under attribute positive successes to them. So there are some real thorny things that get in the way but my general advice is I think we should be less concerned with having to self-promote. We need to find a way to have our successes be conveyed. I think that there are more successful ways to convey successes than us blatantly sharing them unsolicited. And so I’ve been trying to walk people through situations where self-promotion is effective and sometimes we can suffer negative consequences. So sometimes self-promotion is expected and if we don’t do it ALISON BEARD: All right. So let’s talk about trying to solve the problem or walk the line. You first in the article address some strategies that people use that don’t work at all. One example is the humble brag which you say is awful. So explain what that term means for those who don’t know and then tell us why it does not work? LESLIE JOHN: Right. So in the lead in when you said we’re really good at self-promotion ” and I would say some of us think we’re really good at self-promotion because it turns out that some of our mental models about how to self-promote are deeply flawed. That is to say that sometimes our intuitions on how to walk the line between showcasing our strengths without coming across as obnoxious some of our intuitions on how to do that are completely off. One example of that is the humble brag which is – some fascinating research that’s led by Ovull Sezer at UNC… A humble brag is a brag that’s cloaked in a complaint or a statement of modesty or humility. So it’s the kind of thing that once you’re aware of what humble bragging is you notice it all the time. I was bored so I wrote a book.” That’s a complaint-based humble bag. It’s complaining ” but the real brag is writing a book. Another one would be something like it’s really hard being the only one the boss trusts.” And then one based on modesty would be something like “I can’t believe I got a top performance review. Totally unexpected.” You’re trying to take the edge off with modesty. But the thing is in these beautiful controlled studies where Ovul and her coauthors have looked at how you come across when you do that it turns out that you come across worse when you do that relative to if you just did an outright brag. So it would be better to say “I got a top performance review ” than to cloak it in this false humility. ALISON BEARD: There’s another funny term that you used which I hadn’t heard before it’s a little bit of a complex thing where if you want to convey that – let’s say you qualified for the Boston Marathon and you realize that just to say that outright is too abrasive it’s too braggy. So then you ask your people that you know run have you been running much? How’s the running going?” And so you ask them questions that hone in on the topic that you want to talk about the thing that you want to brag about so that you manipulate them into then as a good conversational partner they’re going to ask you how your running is going and then you get to I happened to qualify for the Boston Marathon ” as if it’s like this unplanned unpremeditated break. ALISON BEARD: Funny you should ask me. LESLIE JOHN: But that doesn’t work either because people are on to you. so what are some better ways to self-promote? LESLIE JOHN: So the general advice I would give is but the times when it’s socially appropriate and sometimes socially expected. And so let’s go through those. One is when you’re asked directly. So imagine you’re in a job interview and the interviewer asks you “What are some of your strengths?” And you say I’d prefer not to say.” That’s a terrible thing to do. We’ve got lots of research including some of my own when you refuse to answer questions it makes you come across as untrustworthy as shady. So it’s important if someone asks you directly that you convey that you answer the question and you convey your strengths. ALISON BEARD: And I think people are used to doing that in job interview settings but should we be more attuned to opportunities that might arise in the everyday work day in conversations with colleagues and bosses? LESLIE JOHN: Yeah. So another example would be following the conversational norm of reciprocation or matching. So if someone reveals something that they’ve accomplished then you in turn can reciprocate and reveal something that you’ve accomplished. So reciprocation is a strong conversational norm. We expect people to reveal something that’s similar in return. And so it’s safer to do it in that context. ALISON BEARD: With that one though how do you avoid a sense of one-upsmanship? LESLIE JOHN: You don’t want it to devolve into that and I think there you can look to other conversational tools to grab control of the conversation. For example you can share your success but then you can also end with another question that shifts topics that turns you away from getting into this battle of the braggarts in a way. ALISON BEARD: And then in settings like a conversation with your boss “What are you working on?” should you have talking points or a little speech ready about all you’ve achieved? in the starkest way. I’m envisioning how that would play out and I think in many cases when you just volunteer these hyper quantified proof points of how great you are this gets into the problem where you’re perceived as a little bit obnoxious in doing that. But I do think there’s very much merit in what you’re saying where you want to have a sense in your mind of what the key contributions that you’re making to the team are so that when the conversation naturally shifts to something where it’s appropriate to share that you have those at the tip of your tongue. You don’t want to be scripted about it though because I think there you run into the usual problems where this person is obnoxious and possibly even insecure for doing this. there are some contexts where it’s expected. So LinkedIn everybody knows that this is for job seekers and so we are more accepting of some degree of promoting yourself of conveying your successes and your accomplishments. In fact if you didn’t in that context it may again seem a bit weird or counter normative to not share. Another thing I was thinking about in coming into this interview of the problem of how some people are more naturally conveying their successes and even if we don’t like them for it at the end of the day they are conveying the information in a way that those who are more humble are not. And so I think that organizations can work to formalize or institutionalize the sharing of your accomplishments. So instead of having the performance review just be your supervisor telling you how they thought you did as input to that conversation they’ll have the employee fill out describe what their contributions have been so a formalized way of doing this which I think is helpful in leveling the playing field. ALISON BEARD: When we talk about giving people feedback we talk about the sandwich where you say something good and then something negative and then something good. Can that work in self-promotion too in that you’re not just talking about everything that’s terrific about yourself and what you’ve done but also acknowledging a bit of weakness? LESLIE JOHN: Yeah. So acknowledging some weaknesses can make those strengths more credible and really make them shine. So I’m a leader who says “I’m sometimes nervous about public speaking then it makes those strengths pop more if you will. And one of the reasons is that it makes the person more credible more human. It’s like one of my guilty pleasures is reading gossip magazines “Stars they’re just like us it’s refreshing. I will say that you have to be careful and this strategy works well for people who have been unambiguously successful leaders in firms. It’s a lot more risky if you’re an unproven newbie in the field then I wouldn’t advise doing that. ALISON BEARD: And for those of us who just a really uncomfortable with any self-promotion is it okay to make it about the broader team or group or does that just really diminish the effect? that’s a bit tricky because it diminishes the amount that you personally get credit. I mean is that the long game here is to not just emphasize your contributions but also those of the team because it makes you look good too if the people around you are thriving. And I think that that’s a perfect segue into another point I wanted to make with this piece which is that it’s not all on you to promote yourself. I want to liberate especially those of us who are less comfortable self-promoting which I personally think is a virtue but I want to liberate those of us who feel that way from feeling as though we need to do it ourselves. In fact it’s more compelling if your successes are conveyed by someone else. a mentor or a recruiting agent speaks on your behalf about your strengths then that information on your strengths is actually more credible than if you were to say it yourself. You want to also pay it forward and be thinking about who you can promote. I think sometimes people think of praise and conveying strength as zero sum where if I promote someone else then it’s going to take away from me. But it’s actually on the contrary. There’s also amazing research on how if you promote someone else if you talk positively about someone else then that actually spills over on people’s perceptions of you too. ALISON BEARD: I’m curious as to how this advice translates across different organizations that might have different norms related to self-promotion and then also across countries and cultures. Some places where there’s a more communal culture it might seem very strange for someone to talk about their own accomplishments. How do you navigate that variety? in the absence of having a lot of research on this important question what I would say is be very sensitive to the context. So just as I’m saying it’s safer when others are sharing you want to be sensitive to the context and the culture you’re operating with. So if you are in a workplace that people are more humble by default you want to dial yourself back a little bit to match that where appropriate. On the other hand if you’re in more of a bravado culture then it’s probably safer to be a bit forthcoming. So be very sensitive to the context. ALISON BEARD: Are the rules different depending on your gender or race based on what people are expecting of you? We know there’s still so much unspoken bias out there. So do people of color and women have to walk a finer line than majority group people might have. LESLIE JOHN: Yes. Sadly the answer is yes. So when women outright convey their successes they are penalized more than when men do it. And by penalized they’re perceived as more arrogant or egotistical and so on. So it’s really unfortunate. And why is that the case? It’s probably because a woman’s self-promoting goes against our societal instinct on how a woman “should behave”. I’m aggressively using air quotes because that’s not how it ought to be but that’s just how it is. And so I think women need to be particularly sensitive to these things because we face I think bigger penalties when we violate norms of what’s expected. ALISON BEARD: One other thing about this current moment of 21st century work life is that we’re all in varied stages of working at home probably moving to hybrid environments. So how do you do all of this over Zoom? Is it much more difficult? I think that it is harder because it’s harder to be cognizant of contextual and conversational cues on Zoom. It’s more impoverished just like social media is impoverished relative to in-person. ALISON BEARD: You can still do it but just be more careful. LESLIE JOHN: Yeah. I think you can still do it but just be more careful and you have to really be paying attention. So don’t be multitasking on Zoom because you’re already in an impoverished environment. And then if you’re distracted that makes it even harder to pick up on some of the more subtle cues. ALISON BEARD: And what can organizations do to make sure that people who might feel a little bit uncomfortable promoting themselves have opportunities to do it? So what can I as a team leader do LESLIE JOHN: Great question. So as a team leader I think you want to make sure that you are actively soliciting both from your employees and their colleagues not just on their points of improvement but also on their strengths. So you want to get the information to surface you want to solicit it. And one way that I think organizations can really do that is to formalize the solicitation process. So some companies they elicit the employee’s sense of what their accomplishments are. So it’s not simply the managers evaluating the employee but the employee is giving input is given an opportunity to formally brag so to speak. And we know that when these things are formalized when we’re directly asked to share our successes then it’s acceptable to do that and we should do that. So it levels the playing field I think for people who are more reserved in conveying their successes and for people underrepresented minorities who may be understandably reluctant to share. ALISON BEARD: Is this really just about the individual and how we all can enhance our careers or is there a broader benefit. If we all get better at self-promotion is that actually going to help our teams and our companies? LESLIE JOHN: Yeah. I think that there is a broader benefit to it. I mean if you just think of the interpersonal costs. If we just take the interpersonal costs of bragging when you’re not bragging properly when you’re doing it in a taboo way we talked about these penalties you experience. You’re viewed as less likable the people on the receiving end it makes them feel badly. It can instill envy And so there’s a lot of costs involved with that. Hard to quantify. But if we are better able to navigate this or walk the line between when it’s too much and maybe when it’s not enough in those cases I talked about where it’s actually expected – ALISON BEARD: That reminds me of another point of advice. You talk about celebrating in the right way. And when something really great happens to me at work I just call my mom because I know it’s okay to brag to your mom. So talk a little bit more about how people can celebrate in the right way. so you really want to milk your successes you want to get the most hedonic value out of them that you can and one way you can do that is by reliving them. So I keep it’s literally called in my Outlook Warm Fuzzies. I have a Warm Fuzzies folder and so whenever I get a really positive email I put it in the Warm Fuzzies. And then on rainy days I look through the Warm Fuzzies folder and I reread them in it and it always lifts my mood. ALISON BEARD: My folder is called Praise. LESLIE JOHN: It’s a great thing to do. It also reminds me of an important point which is when you say you were telling your mom about your successes there’s some really amazing research by Emma Levine and Ovul Sezer on hiding your successes. And it’s about how sometimes our instinct is to not reveal our successes. So we may feel imagine we get a promotion at work and we don’t tell our bestie that because we’re worried that it’ll maybe make them feel badly. Well it turns out that if we hide our successes from people who are really close to us that are really rooting for us that can actually be harmful for our relationships. And the reason is that if you think about it why didn’t my bestie tell me about the promotion? Does she think I can’t handle it? Does she think I’m that insecure? So it makes the friend feel that way and it can harm the relationship. So you really do want to share your successes. You want to brag. Your instinct to call your mom is exactly right. The people that are close to you you want to tell them you want to share your successes with them. thank you so much for all that advice on how to brag better. Hopefully we’ll all start putting it into practice. Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School. She’s also the author of the article savvy Self-Promotion.

1620764231.0456429,26218512,https://www.ushistory.org/declaration/related/sons.html,"When in the course of human events . . . In Boston in early summer of 1765 a group of shopkeepers and artisans who called themselves The Loyal Nine began preparing for agitation against the it came to be known as the Sons of Liberty. And grow it did! These were not the leading men of Boston but rather workers and tradesmen. It was unseemly that they would be so agitated by a parliamentary act. Though their ranks did not include Samuel and John Adams the fact may have been a result of a mutually beneficial agreement. The Adams' and other radical members of the legislature were daily in the public eye; they could not afford to be too closely associated with violence neither could the secretive Sons of Liberty afford much public exposure. However amongst the members were two men who could generate much public sentiment about the Act. Benjamin Edes and John Gill of the Boston Gazette produced a steady stream of news and opinion. Within a very short time a group of some two thousand men had been organized under Ebenezer McIntosh The first widely known acts of the Sons took place on August 14 when an effigy of Andrew Oliver (who was to be commissioned Distributor of Stamps for Massachusetts) was found hanging in a tree on Newbury street along with a large boot with a devil climbing out of it. The boot was a play on the name of the Earl of Bute and the whole display was intended to establish an evil connection between Oliver and the Stamp Act. The sheriffs were told to remove the display but protested in fear of their lives for a large crowd had formed at the scene. Before the evening a mob burned Oliver's property on Kilby street then moved on to his house. There they beheaded the effigy and stoned the house as its occupants looked out in horror. They then moved to nearby Fort Hill were they built a large fire and burned what was left of the effigy. Most of the crowd dissipated at that point then under cover of darkness ransacked Oliver's abandoned home until midnight. On that evening it became very clear who ruled Boston. The British Militia kept a low profile. No one dared respond to such violent force. By the end of that year the Sons of Liberty existed in every colony. Their most popular objective was to force Stamp Distributors throughout the colonies to resign. The groups also applied pressure to any Merchants who did not comply with the non-importation associations. Wherever these groups existed they were either directed in secret by leading men in the community or actually lead by them. However who would use the name Sons of Liberty to carry out acts of revenge and other violence not related to the cause. For example in South Carolina a group of sailors calling themselves The Sons of Liberty formed a mob to coerce money from people on the streets*. Such behavior could certainly undermine the cause so the Sons spent a great deal of time policing themselves and pretenders. This was the origin on names such as ""True Sons "" and ""True-born Sons"" of Liberty. The success of these movements in undermining the Stamp Act cannot be attributed to violence alone. Their most effective work was performed in newsprint. A great many of the Sons were printers and publishers themselves and even those who were not were sympathetic to the cause. It was they who would pay the most in duties after all. Nearly every newspaper in the colonies carried daily reports of the activities of the Sons. Accounts of the most dramatic escapades spread throughout the colonies. In one most remarkable incident an account of the Virginia Stamp Act Resolutions was printed far and wide. It is not certain how many of the editors who reprinted it were aware of the status of the resolutions while only five actually passed (the fifth was in fact rescinded the day after adoption.) The ultimate effect of such propaganda was to embolden both citizens and Legislatures in every colony. When the Stamp Act became effective on the 1st of November nearly all of these papers went right on publishing without the required Stamp. In the early months of 1766 there was such chaos that many of the royal governors had gone into hiding. The Sheriffs and Militia that they might have counted on to keep the peace were mostly members of the Sons of Liberty. Governors were afraid to unlock the weapons stores. Few royal troops were available and they were vastly outnumbered in any case. The Sons of Liberty had displaced the royal government in nearly every colony. The Stamp Act Congress had concluded its business but there was little hope that its petition to Gr. Britain would be heard. Correspondence between the various groups began toward the mutual support and defense of the cause. It was expected that eventually British troops would land and attempt to reassert control. So it was that the first efforts to unite the colonies were not undertaken by their respective legislatures but by these independent radical groups. The various Sons throughout the colonies began to correspond and develop a larger organization. ",[],Yes,"business:0.12635771930217743,politics:0.03490844741463661",

1620764239.324019,3451008,https://www.worldhistory.org/Serpent_Mound/,"Ancient History Encyclopedia has a new name! to better reflect the breadth of our non-profit organization's mission. If you have bookmarks or links to our site on your blog or website (also known as Great Serpent Mound) is an archaeological and historic site in Peebles enclosing an effigy mound 1348 feet (411 m) long in the shape of a serpent the largest effigy mound of a serpent in the world. Dating of the site has been problematic as it was first positively dated and attributed to the Native American Adena culture (c. 800 BCE - 1 CE) but later excavations strongly suggested it was built by the natives of the so-called Fort Ancient culture (c. 1000-1750 CE) and around 1070 CE. These dates were both arrived at from artifacts found near the site and carbon dating of charcoal located within the mound. The debate on the mound’s builders continues but the most reasonable conclusion is that it was started by one culture and completed by the other. This is especially probable as the so-called Fort Ancient culture is dismissed by some scholars as a distinct indigenous culture and is recognized as simply a development of the Hopewell culture (c. 100 BCE - 500 CE) which these same scholars claim was the successor to the Adena culture. The mound was first noted and mapped in the early 19th century when European and American scholars became aware of the Native American mound sites throughout the eastern United States. In 1846 Serpent Mound was surveyed by the archaeologists Edwin Hamilton Davis (l. 1811-1888) and E. G. Squier (l. 1821-1888) for the Smithsonian Institution and was included in their seminal work on Native American mound sites Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley which became the basis for later interpretation of the sites up through the 20th century. Their work encouraged the interest in the site of anthropologist Frederic Ward Putnam (l. 1839-1915) often referred to as the ""Father of American who raised the money to purchase and preserve the site which is recognized as a National Historic Landmark and major tourist attraction presently under consideration for inclusion as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is unclear what led to the initial construction of mounds but prior to the arrival of Europeans on the continent they numbered in the thousands. Serpent Mound is only one of many sites built by Native Americans between c. 5000 BCE and c. 1450 CE across North America. It is unclear what led to the initial construction of mounds but prior to the arrival of Europeans on the continent it is thought they numbered in the thousands. The mounds – some over 100 feet (30 m) tall – were all built by cultures who had no beasts of burden and no wheeled vehicles; each was constructed by people carrying bundles of soil in baskets or animal skins which were dumped at a central spot and then shaped by others. The Native Americans who constructed the mounds were initially all hunter-gatherer societies who were nomadic or semi-nomadic practicing at best a rudimentary form of until they decided to put down roots in a given area and built their mounds at least some of them as an expression of religious beliefs. As these communities moved toward a more agrarian lifestyle and agriculture became the primary food source they became more stable and sedentary leading to the rise of enormous urban complexes such as A limited form of agriculture began to appear about 3 and as it spread to other areas generating a larger and more settled population it fueled the development of bigger more complex societies. The most influential were the 'mound-building' Adena and Hopewell cultures which built massive earthworks and and animal forms and developed an extensive network across and beyond the region. (46) The region Wilson references spans the area in the USA from modern-day New York down to Florida Texas and up through Oklahoma to Wisconsin – all of a relatively similar type – and then further west and north into Canada of different types. The artifacts discovered at these mound sites have provided archaeologists with evidence of significant differences in the cultures that built them and these cultures are named either for the lands the sites were found on (such as named for the 19th-century plantation which enclosed it) local tribes (as at Cahokia) or simply as descriptive terms (such as ). One of the most significant of the many cultures living in the Mississippi River Valley was the Adena culture recognized as among the greatest of the mound builders. Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter! The Adena culture is named for the estate of the 19th-century governor of Ohio on whose land the mound now known as Adena Mound was discovered. They were a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer society who eventually came to cultivate crops such as barley establishing permanent residences alongside their crops and raising mounds. Some of these were used for burials of the upper class while others have been identified as ceremonial sites and the purpose of still others is unknown. The Adena knew how to work were not interred with the dead. The Adena sites almost universally produce no goods but a number of artifacts from non-burial sites. The people lived in settlements near or around the mounds in homes made of wood with conical rooftops. The mounds mirrored the homes and were most frequently conical a feature that has come to define Adena culture mounds. the Adena culture was succeeded by the Hopewell (also named for the 19th-century land on which their mounds were discovered) which is thought to differ from the Adena primarily in greater long-distance trade and the creation of geometric earthworks known as effigy mounds – mounds in the shape of some animal and sometimes aligned astronomically. The Hopewell culture is also known as the Hopewell tradition because it has become clear there were a number of different cultures which shared in a larger “umbrella” culture represented by their mound construction in different locations. lived in Kentucky and West Virginia while the Copena were located in Alabama and Tennessee but both built the same kinds of mounds and created similar ceramics. There is no universal agreement on the claim that the Hopewell succeeded the Adena as some scholars believe the Hopewell were simply a development of the Adena and not a 'new' culture. This same sort of debate continues regarding another associated with Serpent Mound Artifacts recovered from Fort Ancient sites suggest a belief in an afterlife & the potency of images of totemic animals. Fort Ancient culture is named after the archaeological site in Ohio – Fort Ancient – another 19th-century designation for a site which was interpreted as an ancient fort. This interpretation has been challenged and revised since later investigation and excavation showed the site could not possibly have been built for defense and was more likely a ceremonial site. The designation of Fort Ancient culture as a distinct culture has also been challenged as the Fort Ancient site has also now been understood as a product of the Hopewell tradition not a 'new' culture that emerged later and so – to some scholars – Fort Ancient culture is an obsolete designation as the site was not a fort and the culture was not distinct from the Hopewell. 'Fort Ancient culture' is still used in discussing the sites associated with the late Hopewell tradition because a significant body of scholarly work has used that term. It should also be noted that there remains a scholarly school of thought which still claims the Fort Ancient culture was distinct from the Hopewell. Whoever these people were they created effigy mounds and ceramics in the images of animals such as turtles and also included grave goods in the internment of their dead. These grave goods show little variation which suggests Fort Ancient was an egalitarian society with no social hierarchy or a fairly fluid social stratification. Artifacts recovered from Fort Ancient sites suggest a belief in an afterlife and the potency of images of totemic animals and this is also reflected in the shapes of the mounds they built. was an expression of animism – the belief that all things contained an animating spirit and were connected in a network of reciprocity – and central to the concept of animism is spiritual power. Wilson notes: The common thread running through every level of East-coast society and every aspect of Indian life was the ubiquitous belief in 'power'…in a universe where every human act has spiritual ramifications and can affect the well-being of the people there is no clear-cut boundary between 'sacred' and 'secular'…Contacts and movements between [the earthly and spiritual realms] had to be mediated through rituals and gift exchanges which acknowledged the respective positions of the two sides and committed them to fulfilling their mutual obligations. (53) An example of this would be thanking a tree one has cut down for lumber or an animal one has killed for food in giving their spirit for one’s benefit. The individual would ritually give thanks for these kinds of gifts through ceremonies and based on artifacts discovered at the various sites these ceremonies frequently were enacted on the tops of mounds which may have been built to focus or control spiritual energies in a given locale. The communal effort that went into building the mound would be a form of thanksgiving to the spirits of the place which would reside or center themselves in the mound and give back to the people. The so-called Fort Ancient culture seems to have paid special attention to honoring the spirit represented in the serpent because snakes seem to have been regarded as symbols of transformation. In shedding its skin the snake became a new snake leaving its old form behind and an individual could awaken spiritually to a new life through recognition of divine energies and be transformed. It is possible that this understanding of the universe influenced the creation of Serpent Mound. Serpent Mound is located in a meteorite impact crater mostly in Adams County formed approximately 3oo million years ago and today known as Serpent Mound Crater. It is possible that the mound builders chose this site for the resonant energies left by the meteorite’s impact but equally possible that the earth-energies – which according to some writers on the subject have always existed in certain areas – drew the people to the site without any special regard for the meteorite or the crater. The mound has thus far yielded no artifacts which could help in dating it; any artifacts associated with the people who built it have come from surrounding mound sites and areas identified as former villages. The mound was initially attributed to the Adena culture based on graves and artifacts discovered nearby including skeletons unearthed in the 1880s that were buried in accordance with known Adena practices. The fact that no artifacts were discovered in the mound itself also suggested an Adena origin since the culture did not bury their dead with grave goods nor include artifacts in their mounds. The serpent’s head is aligned to the summer solstice while the respective coils seem aligned to the solstices & equinoxes. Serpent Mound was therefore positively identified with the Adena and given a probable date of c. 321 BCE until the excavation and carbon dating of charcoal found within the mound in the 1990s which dated the site to c. 1070 CE. This date placed the creation of the mound to the time of the Fort Ancient culture and way past the period of the Adena. Scholars who still favored the interpretation of the Adena as the builders challenged the new claim by suggesting that the charcoal deposit was the result of later efforts at renovation and still maintained Adena provenance. maintain that the charcoal is integral to the original construct of the mound and suggest that the mound may have been built as a response to Halley’s Comet which appeared over North America in 1066 CE. The serpent effigy a representation of the comet. Objections to this claim include the observation that Halley’s Comet has a straight tail – no twists or coils involved – and so Serpent Mound could not be a ""mirror on earth"" of the comet overhead. Some scholars also reject the claim that the Fort Ancient culture built the mound based on the lack of artifacts in the mound and no evidence of Fort Ancient burial practices in the surrounding area. This debate continues in the present day along with what the mound was meant to signify. As noted with a width of around 25 feet and varying in height to between a foot and three feet. The serpent image has seven coils winding back and forth between a tail and a head and this head has been interpreted as either a snake swallowing an egg swallowing the moon (or sun) or not a head at all but a ceremonial plateau on which rituals were conducted. There is no scholarly consensus on the interpretation of the meaning of the head of the snake The serpent’s head is aligned to the summer solstice while the respective coils seem aligned to the solstices and equinoxes. The mound suggests astronomical significance and may have been built as means to chart solar and lunar movements while also serving as a symbol for the spiritual energies focused by the mound. Rituals conducted at the head of the serpent (if any) might therefore have been thought more potent in that they were tapping the focused spiritual energies of the area and coupled with the image of the serpent Serpent Mound was first mapped in 1815 from tail to head and was later surveyed and included in the well-known work of Davis and Squier. Their work attracted the attention of Frederic Ward Putnam who arrived at Serpent Mound in 1885 and was shocked to find that the site were being threatened – and had even been damaged or destroyed – by agricultural activities engaged in by people who considered them of little worth. Putnam raised the funds necessary to purchase the lands surrounding Serpent Mound to preserve it in 1886 and if it were not for his efforts the site would probably not exist today. Putnam devoted himself to the mound sites of Ohio for the next four years. His work along with that of Davis and Squier set the model for interpreting the site going forward. Excavations in the 20th and 21st centuries have continually suggested varying dates of construction and evidence of both Adena and Fort Ancient cultures as the architects and builders and debates concerning the meaning and origin of the site continue in the present day but these arguments have done nothing to diminish or encourage people’s interest in the site. and many other spheres of inquiry have been drawn to the site over the years. In 1967 the Ohio Historical Society created paved paths around the mound for visitors and established the Serpent Mound Museum which features exhibits on the Adena and Fort Ancient cultures as well as other Native American nations who lived in the area. The site is designated a National Historic Landmark and continues to draw visitors from around the world annually who are as fascinated by the great mound today as its 19th-century admirers were in theirs.

As Biden Restores A Malignant “Normalcy ” It’s High Time The Left Declared Its Independence From The Democrats It is misleading to see the election as a victory of democracy over authoritarianism. Biden’s win is the triumph not of democracy but of an oligarchic status quo itself an increasingly authoritarian system.

He is buried at Sherborne Abbey. establishing the Viking kingdom of When the Danish Army moved south Wessex itself was threatened and so together with his brother Alfred they fought several battles with the Ashdown and Basing. Aethelred suffered serious injuries during the next major battle at Meretun in Hampshire; he died of his wounds shortly after at Witchampton in Dorset Alfred was well educated and is said to have visited Rome on two occasions. He had proven himself to be a strong leader in many battles and as a wise ruler managed to secure five uneasy years of peace with the Danes before they attacked Wessex again in 877. Alfred was forced to retreat to a small island in the Levels and it was from here that he masterminded his comeback ‘ as a consequence. With major victories at Edington Alfred established Saxon Christian rule over first Wessex and then on to most of England. To secure his hard won boundaries Alfred founded a permanent army and an embryonic Royal Navy. To secure his place in history EDWARD (The Elder) 899 – 924 Edward unites the kingdoms of Wessex and Mercia. In 923 Constantine II recognises Edward as “father and lord”.

In what is said to be one of the bloodiest battles ever fought on British soil Athelstan defeated a combined army of Scots claiming the title of King of all Britain.

Perhaps unimpressed by the interruption Eadwig had Dunstan exiled to France. Eadwig died in Gloucester when he was just 20 the circumstances of his death are not recorded. The youngest son of Edmund I Edgar had been in dispute with his brother concerning succession to the throne for some years.

If you have bookmarks or links to our site on your blog or website in 1905 and presented as a birthday gift to Edward VII of England (r. 1901-1910) by the Transvaal Government. It weighed well over 3 making it the largest gem-quality rough diamond ever discovered. Worth over $21 million dollars in today's money the diamond was famously sent by registered post from South Africa to England. The rough stone was cut into nine large gemstones each given a name Cullinan I to IX and 96 smaller diamonds. The largest stone is the 530-carat Cullinan I also known as the Star of Africa which now sparkles in the royal sceptre of the . It is the largest colourless cut diamond in the world. The second largest stone the 317-carat Second Star of Africa was set into the Imperial State Crown which is used at coronations of British monarchs. The other larger diamonds are variously worn as pendants and brooches and remain a part of the private jewellery collection of Elizabeth II (r. 1952- ). Discovery & Gift to Edward VII The Cullinan diamond was discovered on 26 January 1905 and is named after Thomas Cullinan the chairman of the Premier Mine where it was found near Pretoria in the Transvaal then a British colony (now a province of South Africa). The stone was discovered by Frederick G. S. Wells Surface Manager at the mine who received a $10 000 bonus for his discovery. The massive uncut diamond weighed 3 106 carats and measured almost 10.1 centimetres (3.9 in) in length and 6.35 cm (2.5 in) in width making it the largest uncut diamond ever found. It was an extraordinary example of a rough diamond for its sheer size but also for the excellent purity and its unique blue-white colour. The stone was first put on public display in the Standard Bank of Johannesburg. The Transvaal Government presented the diamond to King Edward VII of England as a present for his 66th birthday. still in its rough state was sent to London by the Premier Mine Company owners to try and find a suitable buyer. Curiously it was simply posted by registered mail while a decoy was used in an armoured ship everyone thought contained the real stone. Arriving safely enough no private buyer showed any interest and so pushed by the Prime Minister of Transvaal General Louis Botha (l. 1862-1919) the Transvaal Government bought the stone from the Premier Mine Company. The price paid was £150 000 (over £18 million or $21 million today). In 1907 it was decided by the Transvaal Government to present the diamond to King Edward VII of England as a present for his 66th birthday. The glamorous gift was meant to help restore relations between and South Africa following the Second Boer (1899-1902) between the two countries. The stone was taken by police escort to Sandringham House in Norfolk for presentation to the king on his birthday 9 November 1907. The king then gave it to the care of the famed headquarters of the Metropolitan Police until it had been decided what exactly to do with it. In early 1908 it was decided to cut the rough and opaque diamond into brilliant gemstones. In order to get ideas on what exactly to do with the hoped-for gems a team of experts visited the British to see where they might be installed. The diamond was then sent to Joseph Asscher and Company of Amsterdam for cutting a firm specialised in such work. The process to cut out and polish sparkling gems from the huge mass of rough stone began in February 1908 and took the team of three specialists eight months to complete. The original piece was first cut into two pieces weighing 516.5 and 309 carats. The groove for the first cut alone took four days to prepare and when Joseph Asscher himself attempted to make it the steel knife snapped. A second attempt was successful and the original stone was eventually cut into seven large pieces. These were then cut and polished to produce nine large stones each being given the rather unimaginative name of Cullinan plus a numeral from I to IX. Cullinan I and II were formally presented to Edward VII on 21 November 1908 almost exactly one year after he had first set eyes on the uncut stone. This pair of gems then the largest cut diamonds in the world were immediately put on public (and very safe) display in the Tower of London. British Sovereign's Sceptre with Cullinan I Diamond The pear-shaped Cullinan I was the largest stone of the group weighing a massive 530.2 carats - the famous also part of the British Crown Jewels weighs a mere 105.6 carats. Cullinan I is the largest colourless top-quality cut white diamond in the world and the magnificent gem did at least benefit from a new and more romantic name: the Star of Africa. Initially Cullinan I and Cullinan II (see below) were paired together in what must have been a dazzling but rather impractical pendant brooch. Following Edward VII’s in 1910 there was a rethink of just what to do with these magnificent jewels. Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter! All seven Cullinan diamonds (III-IX) are part of the personal jewellery collection of Elizabeth II. The Cullinan I was added to the Sovereign's Sceptre ready for the coronation of George V (r. 1910-1936) in 1911 CE. This is what the original design team had decided the largest stone should be used for back in 1908. The sceptre which is also known as the King’s Sceptre was made in 1661 CE for the coronation of Charles II of England (r. 1660-1685) and it symbolises worldly regal power and good governance. The stone is cradled upright between a two-armed mounting at the top of the sceptre which allows it to be seen from all angles. This mounting is hinged to easily allow the stone to be removed. Due to the extra weight of the diamond it was necessary to reinforce the length of the sceptre. Above the diamond is an amethyst monde itself set with diamonds and one large emerald. The sceptre which measures 92.2 cm in length was part of the regalia used by Queen Elizabeth II at her coronation in 1953. Cullinan II: the Imperial State Crown The second largest stone cut from the original diamond was the oval-shaped Cullinan II. It weighs 317 carats and has acquired the name the Second Star of Africa. In 1910 Cullinan II was set into the gold Imperial State Crown also known as the Crown of State. This crown was originally created for the coronation of Queen Victoria (r. 1837-1901) in 1838 as a lighter alternative to the traditional St. Edward's Crown. It was also used by Edward VII at his coronation. The crown was remodelled still with the Cullinan II in prime position and used by George VI (r. 1936-1952) in his coronation in 1937 and by his daughter and successor Elizabeth II at her coronation. The Cullinan II is set at the front of the crown’s band directly below another famous gemstone the Black Prince's Ruby (actually a balas or spinel). The famous Stewart Sapphire had been in this position but was moved to the back of the crown to make way for the Cullinan II. Besides coronations the crown also makes an appearance at various state occasions such as the annual State Opening of Parliament. Both the crown and the sceptre with Cullinan I are on public display in the Jewel House inside the Waterloo Barracks of the Tower of London. As with Cullinan I the Cullinan II can easily be removed from its crown setting so that it might be worn as a pendant or brooch. The other seven large diamonds cut from the original stone named Cullinan III to IX are all brilliants and sizeable diamonds in their own right. To make the best use of the material various shapes were cut: three are pendeloque (pear-shaped) two are marquise cuts (elongated lozenges) one is rectangular and one square. Photographs were taken to document the cutting and polishing process and many of these are now part of the Royal Collection. In addition to the big nine another 96 small brilliant-cut diamonds were cut from the original Cullinan piece. There was also a remainder of unpolished fragments together weighing nine carats. Some 65% of the original rough diamond had been lost. The two star pieces of this group are Cullinan III which is a pear-shaped stone weighing 94.4 carats and the square-cut Cullinan IV which weighs 63.6 carats. King Edward VII bought Cullinan VI and VIII from Asscher who kept the other large Cullinan stones. The Dutch diamond merchant also kept the 96 smaller stones and unpolished fragments as his fee for cutting the original rough stone. The South African government subsequently acquired all of these stones and presented them to Queen Mary (l. 1876-1953) the consort of George V in 1910 to commemorate the formation of the Union of South Africa that year. In 1911 both Cullinan III and IV were set into the coronation crown of Queen Mary. Queen Mary Wearing the Cullinan Diamonds both Cullinan I and II can be removed from their settings and joined to be worn as a pendant and this was famously done by both Queen Alexandra (consort of Edward VII) and Queen Mary. The latter queen consort even wore a pendant of Cullinan I and II and another pendant of Cullinan III and IV all at once for the State Opening of Parliament on 6 February 1911. The latter two diamonds known affectionately by the royals as 'the chips' are still sometimes worn as a brooch and pendant with the drop Cullinan IV suspended below the square Cullinan III. Both stones are set in a fine lattice setting made of platinum. This combination has been worn by the Queen and by the Duchesses of Cornwall and Cambridge. All seven Cullinan diamonds (III-IX) are part of the personal jewellery collection of Elizabeth II who was bequeathed them by Queen Mary in 1953.

Hearing how a nurse practitioner responds to the various stressors of her job reveals how stress works at a fundamental level. Workplace well-being researcher Mandy O’Neill says that we’re more likely to feel stressed when there is an imbalance between the threat we’re facing and the resources we have to prevent damage or danger. When the current threat feels greater than our available resources we become — understandably — mentally and emotionally strained.

The government spent immense sums of money on troops and equipment in an attempt to subjugate Massachusetts. British merchants had lost huge sums of money on looted and destroyed goods shipped to the colonies. The revenue generated by the Townshend duties amounted to less than £21 except for the one on tea. That same day the Boston massacre set a course that would lead the Royal Governor to evacuate the occupying army from Boston and would soon bring the revolution to armed rebellion throughout the colonies. See also the Tea Act. After the French and Indian War the British Government decided to reap greater benefits from the colonies. The colonies were pressed with greater taxes without any representation in Britain. This eventually lead to the Boston Tea Party. In retaliation the British passed several punative acts aimed at bringing the colonies back into submission of the King. Interested in using a picture?

In order to study this era more easily modern-day scholars have divided it into periods: Woodland Period – c. 500 BCE - 1100 CE Mississippian Culture – c. 1100-1540 CE while efforts have been made to be precise in this dating the various Native American cultures of the region developed at varying rates and in different ways and that various scholars date these periods differently. There was no uniform development of every native culture at the same time everywhere. Some nations continued to use the technology and adhere to the traditions associated with the Woodland Period while others had developed in ways that characterize the Mississippian Culture. Further the designation 'Dalton-Folsom Culture' is used in this article as a general term for a time period in which many different cultures have been identified through differences in their manufacture of projectile points. Each of these cultures or nations like the Evans for example followed their own paths of development. Nations & cultures across North America developed highly sophisticated social orders Some of the nations were nomadic or semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers longer than others who built large urban complexes and engaged in agricultural pursuits and trade but the latter should not be regarded as more “highly developed” than the former. The people of the Great Plains continued the hunter-gatherer mode longer than those on the east coast simply because the terrain and game were better suited to that region. Nations and cultures across North America developed highly sophisticated social orders engaged in long-distance trade and inventing irrigation systems which still exist in parts of the United States in the present day (such as the Southwest notably the area around Phoenix Arizona). As more and more colonists arrived from in the 17th and 18th centuries Native Americans were steadily pushed onto reservations losing the lands they had lived on for thousands of years to the steadily increasing hordes of European immigrants who would eventually regard themselves as the rightful owners of the lands formerly inhabited by natives. Depending on whether one adheres to the long or short chronology Paleoindians migrated from Asia to North America 40 000 years ago. The earlier date is most likely more accurate based on the dispersion and development of the nations throughout North and South America. It is also thought that the people may have migrated by boats hugging the coasts until they settled in areas such as modern-day California possibly at the same time others were migrating by land. Scholar Ron Fisher comments: Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter! Archaeologists mostly agree that the Americas were peopled by migrants from Asia some 30 with much of the world’s water locked up in ice a 600-mile-wide land bridge linked Alaska and Siberia. The peoples crossed this Bering Land Bridge with no notion that they were migrating. As the centuries passed like pollen drifting on a breeze they populated the continent before them. (10) The earliest culture identified is the Clovis so named for the “Clovis Points” first discovered in Clovis New Mexico in 1929. These points are crafted stone spearheads used primarily in hunting game and once identified in New Mexico were recognized in finds located across the continent. Although it does seem there are earlier cultures than the Clovis this designation is used to identify a widespread hunter-gatherer culture that subsisted primarily on hunting so-called megafauna large animals such as great bison The Clovis peoples are thought to have followed the migration patterns of the big game until they came to primarily inhabit a particular region. At this point they seem to have begun to engage in trade with others. Fisher notes: Because points were often found far from their places of manufacture archaeologists know that the people of different societies exchanged them through trade or as gifts. Different sites also tell archaeologists about the sorts of groups who used them: a small site on a hill rich in spear points might have been a men’s hunting camp; a riverside site with tools for making food As the climate changed and more animals were hunted to extinction larger game began to disappear and smaller game survived. At this point the people began to gravitate toward permanent or semi-permanent settlements by lakes and rivers they could harvest for fish. This change in patterns of living differentiates the earlier Clovis Culture from the later Dalton-Folsom Culture which is so-called from the projectiles found primarily in the Southwest (Folsom) and Midwest (Dalton) but identified in finds throughout most of North America dated to c. 8500-7900 BCE. Scholar Alan Taylor comments on this development: The changing climate and demise of the mega-animals induced the nomadic bands to pursue more diversified strategies to tap a broader range of food sources. The natives had to learn their local environments more intimately to harvest shellfish and tubers. The Indians obtained more of their diet from fishing as they developed nets traps and bone hooks. Their hunting evolved into the patient and prolonged tracking of more elusive mammals and caribou. Beginning about nine thousand years ago the Indians adjust to their smaller fleeter prey by developing the – a spear thrower that provided increased thrust The tips of the spears hurled by the – a carved stick with a cup at one end which held the butt of a projectile to be thrown – are these Dalton-Folsom points which give the culture its name. The is only one of the tools developed during this period as the Dalton-Folsom people are also characterized by the development of stone knives and other tools. The points of the spears were resharpened after each hunt using a type of whetstone and the knives were crafted with serrated edges for cutting meat for meals and hides for clothing. This culture also shows the first signs of religious belief and an afterlife based on goods found at sites dated to this period. divine power informed the culture of the Archaic Period who are chiefly characterized by their construction of large earthen mounds which have given them the epithet of “mound builders”. These mounds were initially created as sacred spaces where rituals were enacted and may also have served as “homes to the gods” and to elevate the priest above the world of the rest of the community. The earliest mounds date to the so-called Middle Archaic Period around 5400 BCE primarily in modern-day Louisiana (specifically the Ouachita Mound at Watson Brake the oldest mound complex in North America) and surrounding states and sometimes seem to have become religious or political centers for the surrounding community. Permanent settlements were established at this time and plants and some animals were domesticated. The dog was already domesticated by this time and traveled with the earliest arrivals from Asia. Small communities of the Early and Middle Archaic periods developed into larger by the Late Archaic Period when sites such as were established. The Poverty Point site has given its name to the unknown people who constructed it – the Poverty Point Culture – and both derive from the name given by Phillip Guier to his 19th-century plantation. Guier farmed the land without recognizing that the “hills” of concentric half-circles were artificial earthworks created by Native Americans. No one else realized this either until 1953 when an aerial photograph clearly showed concentric earthworks built out facing a plateau. Mound building continued and developed during the Woodland Period (usually divided into Early a term which is usually associated with the eastern and middle regions of North America but is equally applicable to the Southwest and Great Plains in that similar advances were made across the continent. Ceramics became more refined as did craftwork generally as evidenced by statuary and weapons. In the Southwest nations like the Hohokam built cities and designed efficient irrigation systems. In Alaska the Inuit developed stone lamps and harpoons. Toward the east individual nations built mounds not only as sacred places but for and each different group engaged in long-distance and local trade. One of the most significant developments was in the area of as evidenced by artifacts found at various sites. Poverty Point clearly shows a high level of some kind of religious activity early on but religion was only one aspect of that site as it was also residential. Some sites of the Woodland Period were built and used entirely for religious purposes. The Pinson site includes 17 large mounds and artifacts discovered there clearly indicate it was never residential but served a sacred purpose. The Native Americans observed the religious belief of animism – the conviction that all things in nature are animated by a spirit and all are interconnected – and so recognized that the unseen world was just as real and powerful as the one they walked through in their daily lives. Taylor comments: Natives believed that humans lived inside that web of the natural and supernatural. They conceived of their actions with all other-than-human beings as essentially social as involving creatures more like than unlike themselves. Indeed in their myths and dreams people and the other-than-human could metamorphose into one another. As in all aspects of native life the fundamental principle in harvesting nature was the pursuit of reciprocity. People felt justified in claiming a share in the other life around them but felt obligated to reciprocate by paying ritual honor and by minimizing waste. (19) This reciprocity took the form of personal and communal gestures of gratitude for the life of an animal taken or a tree cut down for lumber but sacred sites like Pinson Mounds were another expression of this same sentiment. Mound building in general was a response to the unseen world in that the forces of nature could be focused and controlled by centering them in a mound that raised the celebrants toward the heavens but kept them firmly connected to the earth. As mounds were often also raised by water it is thought that all four elements of earth and water were celebrated and given thanks during mound rituals. The Mississippian Culture is so-called because the people primarily lived in the Mississippi River Valley but they also established cities and villages in the Ohio River Valley and elsewhere ranging from the Northeast down to Louisiana and out toward Indiana. The Mississippian Culture’s best-known communities were the Adena Culture (c. 800 BCE-1 CE) and the Hopewell Culture (c. 100 BCE - 500 CE) who built numerous mounds and further developed trade and technology. The Adena built cone-shaped mounds while the Hopewell’s were more intricate often in the shape of animals but both served a religious function. the mounds of the Hopewell Culture can only be fully recognized and appreciated from above. How the people were able to create a work they themselves could not see is unknown. The skill of the Adena and Hopewell in their ceramics and technology such as irrigation ditches is impressive as is their apparent talent in farming and abilities in trade. Scholar Yvonne Wakim Dennis comments on the perception of Native Americans as “noble savages” quietly wandering the land Far from being the passive children of nature depicted in colonial reports…Indians practiced calculated and extensive resource management. Nor were the people of the Midwest simple nomads considered distinct from both the Adena and Hopewell the largest urban center in North America prior to the 18th century which flourished between c. 650 - c. 1350 CE. Cahokia may have developed through an appeal by the priestly class to neighboring communities to come and participate in the construction of the city’s enormous ritualistic mound – known as Monks Mound today – as well as the other 119 mounds used for other purposes. Cahokia was a grand city with a wide central plaza & long fields of crops. Cahokia was a grand city with a wide central plaza residences for the lower class and others for the elite and long fields of corn and other crops. The Cahokians cultivation of corn is one of the aspects separating them from the earlier cultures which had not mastered this crop. Their corn cultivation was so successful it not only fed the people of the city but was used in local and long-distance trade. (located in Alabama) engaged in long-distance trade and drew people for religious services between c. 1100 – c. 1450 CE. The original names of both Cahokia and Moundville are unknown. Cahokia is named for the tribe living nearby at the time the site was first noticed by Europeans in the 19th century and Moundville was given its fairly unimaginative name for the many mounds dotting the landscape by the Black Warrior River. Map of Mississippian and Related Cultures The Moundville people maintained a strictly stratified social hierarchy which they demonstrated through the of the city. The wealthy lived in wooden homes on top of the mounds which all faced the central mound in the plaza below while the lower classes lived in thatch huts on the other side of the plaza. At some point the city seems to have become a religious center and place of pilgrimage as its population increased at the same time that artifacts suggest a greater frequency of religious rituals. The Mississippian Culture was still flourishing although Cahokia had been abandoned (most likely due to overpopulation) when the Spanish conquistador Hernando De Soto (l. c. 1500-1542) arrived in the region in 1541. De Soto’s small army came in search of they had been informed could be found in abundance and killed a number of natives they believed were hiding the vast treasure from them. The De Soto expedition also brought diseases the natives had no immunity to which killed many more even after De Soto himself had died and his men had returned to the coast. The Spanish continued to make forays into the south and southwest regions of North America while the French were establishing themselves in Canada and throughout the Midwest of the present-day United States down to Louisiana. The French brought diseases that killed large numbers of natives just as the English would do when they started arriving. The English first attempted colonization through the in 1585 and again in 1587 and then finally managed to succeed with the which also would have failed if not for the intervention and assistance given by the native tribes of the . The English also attempted colonization of New England in 1607 through the which was also assisted at first by the natives until it failed. New England was first successfully colonized by the English in 1620 with the establishment of – which also owed its survival to the Native Americans this time by the tribes of the As more Europeans arrived in the “land of opportunity” they seized more and more native lands pushing the original inhabitants further and further into the interior. The natives fought back in a series of wars from the (1675-1678) and many others up through the 18th century and into the 19th but a lack of cohesion and unity on their part coupled with the seemingly unending supply of immigrants the English were able to send against them eventually led to their defeat. By the late 19th century most Native Americans were confined to reservations and the immigrants having stolen their lands through treaties that were never honored then settled into their new home and named states and parks after the people who had once owned everything.

It’s sometimes in the news after a massacre by one of its semi-automatic guns. For instance its AR-556 pistol was used in the 2017 and the 2021 massacres in Boulder Indiana. Concern for its sales of its 10/20 model to Israel which uses them to shoot .22 caliber bullets in Palestinians as a way of “crowd control” led to the creation of the called “No Rugers to Israel”. There’s less attention paid to the enormous support Ruger gives to the far-right organization called the National Rifle Association (NRA) a group that helped create the climate in which the January 6 attempted insurrection was a sudden storm. The NRA was started after the Civil War by two Union soldiers who wanted to improve marksmanship. The of the first federal gun law in 1934 which cracked down on the machine guns beloved by Bonnie and Clyde and other bank robbers. For many decades it was a club of hunters and sportsmen but that was long ago. Now it’s intensely political led by men hysterically afraid of regulation which they consider socialism and tyranny. took a look at the covers of “The American Rifleman” which is given away free to NRA members. For the magazine’s first 50 years (since its founding in 1923) covers would be about hunting but in 1977 a man who had been the first head of the U.S. Border Patrol took over the group. Then the organization became heavily political. “American Rifleman” covers changed. Politicians to love or to hate were frequently on the cover. The Rifleman started hammering away about “freedom” and the sanctity of the second amendment and the supposed terrifying threat of crime. Harlon Carter was fiercely against gun control. When asked by a member of Congress if he was so against a screening process would he accept “convicted violent felons violently addicted to narcotics people to have guns”? He replied it was the “price of freedom”. But Harlon Carter was a cupcake compare to Wayne LaPierre who became the chief exec of the NRA in 1991. In 1992 President Clinton’s Administration would be a “gun-grabbing goon squad”. Covers of “The American Rifleman” grew more and more hysterical. In 1994 it had a “Stop the Rape of Liberty” with a man grabbing the Statue of Liberty and pulling at her clothing. brought up a new theme in his first book published in 1994. In it he talked about insurrection. “[T]he people have a right…to take whatever measures necessary to abolish oppressive government.” That year after a gun control measures passed his article in a “Special Report” in the Rifleman was called asserting that President Clinton’s ban on assault weapons “gives jackbooted government thugs more power to take away our constitutional rights destroy our property and even injure and kill us.” This just added to the radical-right rhetoric that was influencing unhinged minds in those days who armed themselves to the hilt and formed groups called “militias”. A week after LaPierre’s letter four-year NRA Timothy McVeigh blew up the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City and killed 141 people. The NRA was widely criticized in the media and made a concession that his rhetoric was sometimes “overblown”. In 1997 a cover featuring Charlton Heston talked about a “crusade” to defend the Second Amendment. A couple of years later it featured a now Alzheimer-diminished Heston challenging Al Gore to take away his rifle from “his cold dead hands”. In 2015 the words “Are you prepared for the 700 most dangerous days American has ever faced?” over some fanciful red death ray. Days after seventeen students were killed by a gunman in Parkland Fl on Valentine’s Day in 2018 one of the NRA’s “mainstream media loves mass shootings”. A week later LaPierre spoke to the Conservative Political Action Conference and ranted on about in the U.S. and Europe and how socialists were smearing gun rights advocates. At the end of that bloody month NY Gov Andrew Cuomo a “communist” because of NY gun laws. In November the Rifleman cover featured a huge wave hitting the Statue of Liberty along with the message “Your Vote is All that’s Prevents the Socialist Wave on 11/6.” who had a permit to carry a gun and who was Black was shot by a police officer during a traffic stop the NRA was silent. The editorial board commented with a piece entitled “Gun Rights for Whites Only”. Ironically (sickeningly?) the NRA on twitter describes itself as “America’s Longest-Standing Civil Rights Organization.” The NRA supported the radical-right Donald Trump and associates in the 2016 election to the tune of summed up the NRA’s right-wing extremism nicely. It was entitled “NRA laid the groundwork for deadly Capitol riot for years say gun control advocates” The article also notes “After the January 6 attempted putsch the NRA waited nine days to comment in a that we should all ‘respect the rule of law’”. Did it learn its lesson? Of course not. On April 14 it about Biden that “Joe couldn’t care less about his Oath of Office. He wants to light our Constitution on fire.” organization called the NRA is a Radical-Right outfit. Sturm Ruger and Co. has its headquarters in Fairfield CT. It sells more rifles revolvers and pistols than any other U.S. company. Its connections to the NRA are deep. First there is the money. Let’s go to 2011. Ruger pledged to give $1 to the NRA for every Ruger weapon sold. By August had be raised. The CEO at that time said Ruger was well on its way to send the NRA $1 million. When the campaign ended in 2012 Ruger had sold 1 000 guns and so gave the NRA $1.2 million. The reported on this on January 5 three weeks after a gunman used a (non-Ruger) semi-automatic weapon to kill 20 children and 6 teachers in nearby Newtown. Here’s a proud of Fifer presenting LaPierre with a giant check. That was only the beginning. Ruger sweetened its pledge and promised to give the for every gun sold. After one year of this the new CEO of Ruger gave the NRA a check for wrote that Ruger “directed $10 million to the N.R.A. in 2015 and 2016.” You recall that 2016 was that special year when $50 million of NRA money went to elect Donald Trump and friends. Once Trump was in donations in 2017 and 2018 declined to It’s not clear how much Ruger gave to the NRA in recent years. It was listed as an elite “Defender” rank donor to the NRA legislative arm in media releases in . How many millions in donations get you to “Defender” level is not apparent. There’s also the money Ruger spends on advertising with the NRA. For instance in 2016 Ruger paid the NRA Ruger has sent tons of money to the NRA contributions from gun-maker Smith and Wesson. though. There’s interlocking staff and Board members. who is on the board director of Sturm Ruger is a past president of the NRA and a paid consultant for the NRA. She is also a member of the NRA . was also a former President of the NRA Foundation’s board of trustees. Then there’s the National Shooting Sports Foundation. It’s the firearm trade association whose members are all in the gun industry. It’s based in Newtown Connecticut. Its president and CEO is . From 1980 to 2008 Sanetti held various position in Ruger and Chief Operating Officer. Chris Killoy was on the board. Relations between the NRA and NSSF are shall we say that the NRA and the NSSF are “generally aligned on policy issues.” One illustration highlights the tight connection between Ruger and the extremist NRA. It’s a picture of the Ruger ~ Mark II William B Ruger Endowment Special NRA Edition on the site of the company. It shows a blue-steel receiver with handsome ivory-covered grips. The tells us that its original (2003) price was $334. We’re told its shipped in a “red Ruger commemorative case with Special Ruger/NRA crest logo.” If Sturm Ruger ever criticized the NRA publicly it’s not obvious. It didn’t denounce its ally not for its hysteria before the Oklahoma bombing not for using senile Charlton Heston to whip up frenzy not for its massive support for ultra-right politicians in 2016 and not for “laying the groundwork” for January’s attempt to overthrow US elected government. Ruger and the NRA seem to be joined at the hip. Ruger doesn’t propagandize about “freedom” and “tyranny” on its own websites. It leaves that to the NRA. Ruger’s goal is to sell guns and make money. Fear of crime sells guns. Fear of a “gun-grabbing government” sells guns. The NRA creates the hysteria. Ruger rakes in the cash. I wrote to CEO Killoy by email and postal letter asking for possible corrections or comments but have not received any reply. Stanley Heller is Administrator of Promoting Enduring Peace and host of the TV news magazine “The Struggle.” He’s author of “Zionist Betrayal of Jews: From Herzl to Netanyahu"" and hosts the TV program “TheStruggle”. No Joint Struggle With Settler Colonialism right? Isn’t that worth a few bucks -maybe more?  Please timely analysis unswerving in its commitment to struggles for peace has called “socialism” for a half-century. To see lots of photos of Ruger-NRA pistols and rifles search online for “Ruger-NRA pistols” and “Ruger-NRA rifles” and then click on the “Images” tab Seeing the close connection between Ruger (and no doubt other gun companies) and the far-right NRA and the awful climate the NRA has stirred up AND considering the inability of the US Congress to do anything rational on guns despite massive gun deaths and gun caused massacres I have this suggestion:  Nationalize all gun-making and ammunition-making companies grossing over $1 million a year.  Arrange for community-worker management of the companies.  Guns would still be sold but the companies would be banned by law from engaging in politics and from lobbying Congress and from advertising  in journals that engage in politics or lobbying. People would still have the “right to bear arms” but there would be no mad corporate push to sell more and more and more weapons.

Smith not only belonged to the Carpenters' Company — he designed their headquarters Carpenters' Hall. Founded in Philadelphia in 1724 the Carpenters' Company was organized to share information about the art of building determine the value of completed work and help indigent craftsmen. Simulating the trade guilds of 18th century England the Carpenters' Company has held regular meetings for over 275 years making it the oldest trade guild in the country. Carpenters of the Colonial Era were architects as well as builders. The Company published a book of rules and prices and architectural designs called in 1786. Only members of the Carpenters' Company were allowed to see the book. If a Carpenter showed it to an outsider he would face expulsion. It's been said that Thomas Jefferson was rebuffed in his attempt to obtain a copy of the book in 1817. Located in the hub of colonial and capital Philadelphia the Carpenters often found themselves in the center of political activity. This building housed the seven-week session of the did they not meet at the State House ( ) just a block away? The State House was perceived to be a hive of Tory sympathizers. In fact some members of the Royalist press even suggested that the necks of the Revolutionary insurgents ""might be inconveniently lengthened"" if they did not desist in their activities. Carpenters' Hall also served as the headquarters of the First Bank of the United States in 1791. Others to occupy the venerable rooms include: the Bank of the State of Pennsylvania the United States Law Office the Second Bank of the United States and the Philadelphia Auction Market. Although pleased with their success in renting space in their building they were being squeezed out so they built New Hall next door for their needs. However no sooner was it completed than Secretary of War moved himself and his staff to the new building. the building is in the form of a Greek cross. The pedimented doorway with Doric detail is gracious and welcoming. Three Palladian windows line the second floor under which are stone balustrades. The belt course (band separating the floors) is unusual in that it is outlined in wood instead of brick. At one time the gable over the windows contained the words ""The Company Constituted 1724."" In between the words ""company"" and ""constituted"" was the Carpenter's escutcheon. Underneath that read ""Carpenters' Hall"" in large letters. Inside the Hall eight Windsor chairs used by members of the First Continental Congress are on display. Also displayed are early carpentry tools.

If you have bookmarks or links to our site on your blog or website Interview: The Werewolf in the Ancient World by Daniel Ogden World History Encyclopedia is talking to author Daniel Ogden about his new book The Werewolf in the Ancient World. we are very excited to have you. Would you tell us a little bit about your new book? This is actually the first book devoted to the subject of werewolves in the ancient world. There is an infinite number of books on werewolves but there is nothing focussed on the ancient world. The book attempts to understand the ancient evidence in itself and to make sense of the way werewolfism was thought about in the ancient world. But probably the most important contribution is to try to relate the ancient evidence to the more recent evidence which is the medieval evidence. In the 12th century there is a sudden upsurge in werewolf stuff in there is a continuous tradition. A lot of things change in the early modern period there is a continuous tradition. There is a direct link between the modern-day perception and the werewolves back in the 12th century. Kalvicio de las Nieves (CC BY-NC) in the 7th century BCE and petered out more or less in about 400 CE. There are 800 years when we have almost complete radio silence on werewolves before they reappear in the 12th century. There are two obvious hypotheses. One is that people in the 12th century were reading the ancient texts and suddenly got interested in werewolves again and restarted it all which is a perfectly reasonable suggestion. The other is that basically werewolves are deeply embedded in European folklore for a few centuries in the ancient world and then during the dark ages and then popped up more or less as they have been back in the 12th century CE. My argument is that the second hypothesis we do not necessarily know where the myth has originated from. Did it sort of just turn up? ""I think werewolves belong in stories. The home of the werewolf is the campfire horror story always was."" - Daniel Ogden we do not know where it comes from and that is also a matter of debate. Some would say is the notion of werewolfism is a projection of ideas about bands of young warriors. It is an unsupported idea that many ancient and indeed more modern societies have this culture of putting transitional youths into a certain kind of warrior group. In the ancient world they would have been typically light-armed warriors who are sent off to the borders of a community to patrol the border rather than the heavy-armed serious soldiers. They would argue that there are many societies that have this sort of young warrior tradition and werewolves are a way of thinking about young men becoming these sorts of slightly wild warriors of the margins. I do not believe that myself. Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter! I should say this is a very interesting case but I do not think that the werewolf grew out of such a social or cultural practice. I think werewolves belong in stories. The home of the werewolf is the campfire horror story always was. And it is a very striking which is then used metaphorically by societies in different ways. And indeed this notion of the youthful warrior band is one sort of thing that the pre-existing notion of the werewolf can be associated with but there are other things too. It can be associated and we find both of those in the ancient world. When you are thinking about youths turning into men there is a lot of other wild animals you could have potentially used that might be more appropriate than wolves. It does not necessarily strike me as something you have to use a wolf for. So your hypothesis makes a lot of sense. Looking across all the world's cultures for example? I am very reluctant to talk about the universal features of werewolves beyond the notion of a man turning into a wolf and possibly turning back again. I am reluctant to sort of add any more to our basic definition of the concept. But one thing that is really quite pervasive in the ancient evidence and in is this notion of 'into the woods'. This phrase 'into the woods' recurs so often. A man turns into a wolf as he runs off into the woods and occasionally a man runs off into the woods and then becomes a wolf. But there is always this notion of the title of that recent Stephen Sondheim musical with being symbolic of our folkloric history. But I do think that does relate to something fundamental that the werewolf embodies this transition or opposition between or negotiation of the civilised human on the one hand and the wild animal on the other. If one gets to that point one can see that maybe there is some sort of sense in choosing a wolf because there are senses in which wolves might be considered to be the ultimate wild animal. I think another factor is actually that very very broadly wolves are just about human size at least the bigger ones can be. It is easy to imagine a transition between a human and a wolf in a way that it is not easy to imagine a transition between a human and a rabbit for example. Dolon on an Attic Red-figure Lekythos it is like they have chosen the animal the closest to people and I guess the dichotomy between the civilised man and the wild man goes back so far as well if you think of the Epic of with Gilgamesh and Enkidu who balance each other and they learn something from each other. That is a very good point. Yes. did it alter very much? I know we have had that dark period but was it just the idea of the man turning into the wolf and then turning back into a man? Or were there specific points that changed? the notion of the man who recurringly changes into a wolf I think many people would consider that to be fairly integral to the modern idea of a werewolf. that is another thing. That probably starts as far as our evidence is concerned in the medieval period. It is not necessarily typical of the way werewolves were thought about in the ancient world. However the ancient world has one particularly good story about a werewolf and this is told by Petronius. This story is told in Petronius' novel Satyricon. It is the story of a dinner party given by a nouveau riche person called Trimalchio who is an ex-slave a freedman. He is completely uneducated but likes to boast of his education and so he gets all these myths wrong. At one point in the dinner party he and one of his fellow freedmen Niceros exchange campfire horror stories. Niceros' story is about werewolves so he tells a story supposedly from his past when he was still a slave himself and despite being a slave he had a girlfriend who had a pub. The timing of it is all a bit vague but seemingly he is setting off during the night to visit her and his master has a soldier friend staying with him and the soldier decides to come along for the trip. They are walking down the road and it is a road lined with tombs. At one point the soldier stops to have a pee against the tombs. Niceros is standing with his hands in his pockets and whistling and when he turns back he sees that the soldier had actually taken all his clothes off. Then he pees around the clothes in a circle and turns himself into a wolf and runs off. So Niceros goes to the pile of clothes to either retrieve them safely or see what is going on and finds that they have been turned to stone. This peeing in a circle was clearly very magical and it is clearly designed to protect the clothes. He is terrified now and he is in a road of tombs anyway but he imagines himself being attacked by ghosts from all sides as he runs on and finally gets to his girlfriend's house. The pub is also a farm as well and his girlfriend tells him he should have been there earlier because a wolf got in amongst the sheep and was butchering them. One of their slaves put a spear through his neck and he ran off with this neck wound. The next morning Niceros is on his way home and as he passes the tombs where the clothes were left and there is blood. When he finally gets home he finds his soldier friend lying in bed with a doctor tending to his neck wounds. At that point he realised he was a werewolf. You might have thought maybe he might have realised that when you saw him turning to a wolf. But nonetheless he says that ""I refused to break bread with him ever again."" I should also say that there is a full moon whilst this is going on or maybe it says that the moon is brightly shining so maybe not a full moon. as if there was an importance in it. sure. So that is a great story and there are a number of important ideas. It is quite interesting that the guy says that he only realises the soldier was a werewolf when he finds him in bed with a neck wound. The identifying wound is a very common theme in the later medieval European stories. I think you can see the force of it as a motif already in the ancient world because as I just made clear it is illogical really in the context of the Petronius story. He knew that he was a werewolf when he saw him transform but it was clearly already such a fundamental well-established motif that you recognise a werewolf by an identifying wound. The other point to comment on is the importance of keeping the clothes safe. The motif is not explained any further in the ancient context but it does not need to be; it is obvious. Why does a werewolf need to keep his clothes safe? Well we can easily guess that it is because he needs his clothes if he is going to turn back into a human. That notion of keeping the clothes safe because you depend on them to turn back into a human becomes much more developed in the medieval period. There is the notion that werewolfism is what you might call cyclical & not a one-off transformation. because I feel like with werewolves in pop culture nowadays that does not get explained. In a movie you see someone just rip through their clothes and turn into a werewolf are the clothes going to come back when you turn back into a man or do you have to walk home naked'? This does not get explained. : Another thing worth saying about that story is that although we only see him transform into a wolf once it is clearly assumed that this is something that recurs. And again ""I refused to ever share bread with him again"" is clearly because he fears it might happen again and he might get eaten by a wolf. There is the notion that werewolfism is what you might call cyclical and not a one-off transformation. That is very important in modern ideas of the werewolf. and the fact that he has peed around his clothes suggests he was obviously aware of what he has to do. it also implies that the werewolf has magical powers as well. We cannot all just pee around our clothes and turn them to stone. Were werewolves seen as negative or were they revered in cultures? Was it a positive thing to have a werewolf? There are so many interpretations. Already in the ancient world a number of references seem quite neutral strangely. Sometimes we hear of sorcerers or witches turning themselves into wolves. they were not always men? The one batch of evidence relating to turning into wolves is related to witches and that is pretty much confined I think I'm right in saying to Latin poetry. Mainly elegiac poetry there are female werewolves in the ancient world. There are ostensibly good guys too. You have to work hard to reconstruct it from references in Pliny and . A chap called either Demarchus or Demaenetus was turned into a wolf in Arcadia. The story is told in such an elusive way it is difficult to reconstruct it but what seems to have happened is - this is my guess anyway - he was attending the sacrifice of Lycaeus (Wolfie Zeus) on Mount Lycaon (Mount Wolfie) and an enemy slipped some human flesh into his portion of the sacrifice. The animal sacrifice is shared equally in the usual way but somehow some human flesh is slipped in It is quite appropriate that actually eating human flesh should be regarded as a way of transforming somebody into a wolf and this is not the only evidence for that. So having done that he is turned into a wolf for a period of and we are not told how he manages to transform back. I do not know if there was a special way or maybe he just contracted a nine-year curse by eating the flesh. But after that he becomes a very distinguished Olympic victor and there is no strong indication that he was a bad guy. He seems to be a good guy and he certainly ended up as a good guy. So you can have the good werewolf and I think he was sort of a victim of deceit. That is actually a theme again with those early medieval werewolves as well; they tend to be victims of deceit in some way. That is interesting because I guess when you think about werewolves nowadays you get both good and bad werewolves in stories so it is never clear-cut.

If you have bookmarks or links to our site on your blog or website diamond (also spelt Koh-i-Nur or Kūh-e Nūr) with a weight of 105.6 carats is one of the largest and most famous cut diamonds in the world. The name of the stone is Persian meaning ‘Mountain of Light’ and refers to its astounding size. The stone was likely found in southern and then it changed hands many times over the centuries almost always into the possession of male rulers. Like many large gemstones the Koh-i-Noor has acquired a reputation of mystery it is said that only a female owner will avoid its aura of ill omen. The stone is claimed by both India and Pakistan the Koh-i-Noor remains irresistible to its present owners The early history of the Koh-i-Noor is very far from being as clear as the interior of the stone itself. The diamond may even be referenced in Mesopotamian texts of the late 4th millennium BCE but scholars are not in agreement on this. One of the problems with the Koh-i-Noor’s history is the temptation to identify it as any large diamond mentioned in ancient texts connected with events of the Indian subcontinent. The more traditional view is that the stone was most likely found in the Golconda mines of the Deccan between 1100 and 1300 although its first appearance in written records is when it belonged to Babur (1483-1530) (c. 1162/67-1227). The diamond is mentioned in the Mughal emperor’s memoirs which he wrote in 1526 and was likely acquired as a spoil of a fate it would endure several more times over its long history and association with rulers. Babur described the stone as ""worth half of the daily expense of the whole world"" (Dixon-Smith Nader Shar described the diamond as a or 'mountain of light' & the name has stuck ever since. An alternative view is that Babur was talking about another stone and it was actually his son and successor who received the Koh-i-Noor as a gift from the Raja of Gwalior (a state in central India) after victory at the First of Panipat in 1526. Whichever of these versions of events is correct the result is the same the Mughal royal family now had possession of the stone and they wowed their court visitors by setting it in their Peacock Throne. A third view again with the same result is that it was not until the mid-17th century that the Mughal emperors acquired the stone following its discovery in the Kollur mines of the Nader Shah & the ‘Mountain of Light’ By the 18th century we are on firmer ground in tracing the stone’s history. When the Persian leader Nader Shah (l. 1698-1747) attacked and captured Delhi in 1739 he acquired the diamond despite the then Mughal emperor trying to hide it in his turban. When he first saw the stone Nader Shar described it as a Koh-i-Noor or 'mountain of light' and the name has stuck ever since. When Nader Shah died in 1747 the diamond was claimed by his foremost general Ahmad Shah (l. c. 1722-1772) who founded the Durani Dynasty of rulers in Afghanistan. The Durani eventually lost their grip on power and Shah Shujah (l. 1785-1842) was obliged to flee to India in 1813 when he gave the diamond as a gift to the ruler of the Punjab Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1780-1839 CE). Maharajah Duleep Singh (l. 1838-1893) inherited it when only five years old but he was to be the last ruler of the Punjab and Sikh Empire as the tentacles of the British Empire stretched forth into northern India. The 1852 reworking gave the stone more facets as an oval-cut brilliant & dramatically reduced the weight from 186 to 105.6 carats. The British-backed East India Company was the next owner of the diamond when it took over the Punjab region in 1849 CE. The peace treaty which ended the Anglo-Sikh Wars (1845-49 CE) specified that the stone was to be given to Queen Victoria (r. 1837-1901). The diamond was then sent from Mumbai (then Bombay) to Portsmouth . The stone arrived safely enough and was presented to the queen in a special ceremony in London in July 1850. The Koh-i-Noor was the central stone of a trio of diamonds set in a and enamel armlet or bazu-band to be worn on the upper arm. According to legend along with the stone was a note reminding of its curse: He who owns this diamond will own the world but will also know all its misfortunes. Only God or Woman can wear it with impunity. The curse story may have originated with a sensationalist news story in the which was then taken up by the The press in England was eager to add hype for the soon-to-open and already much-anticipated Great Exhibition in London in 1851 where it was already rumoured the diamond would be displayed to the public.

The queen was said to have been impressed with the size of the stone remarking that it was ""indeed a proud trophy"" (Dixon-Smith a little dissatisfied with the lack of sparkle of its ‘rose’ cut when the fashion in at the time was for multi-faceted gems and there was a distinct preference for sparkle over sheer size. Nevertheless the stone was a star attraction at the Great Exhibition even if the satirical magazine described the dullish stone as a ""Mountain of Darkness"" (Tarshis 142). The queen had also worn it at the opening ceremony of the exhibition. Then after consultation with the queen her husband Prince Albert (l. 1819-1861) and the noted optics expert Sir David Brewster the stone was reworked in 1852 under the direction of the royal jewellers Robert Garrard of London. The Duke of Wellington was given the honour of making the first cut and he then stepped aside for two Dutch diamond experts to work their magic: Voorsanger and Fedder. which took some 450 hours to complete gave the stone more facets as an oval-cut brilliant and dramatically reduced the weight from 186 to 105.6 carats. The stone measures 3.6 x 3.2 x 1.3 centimetres. Although now significantly smaller the recutting did remove several flaws and made the stone much more suitable for wearing as a brooch which the queen preferred. A famous painting of Victoria by Franz Xaver Winterhalter was commissioned in 1856 and it shows her wearing a brooch which had once belonged to Queen Adelaide (l. 1792-1849) now set with the Koh-i-Noor. This new setting was a work once again carried out by Garrard’s jewellers. On other occasions Victoria wore the stone as part of either a bracelet or circlet for the head. the Koh-i-Noor diamond has appeared in several crowns but because of its reputation as a bringer of bad luck for male wearers it has only ever been set in the crowns of queen consorts. It was worn in the crown of Queen Alexandra (l. 1844-1925) for her coronation in 1902 and was reset in a new crown for the coronation of Queen Mary (l. 1867-1953) in 1911. Today the diamond sparkles in the centre of the band of the Crown of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother (l. 1900-2002) the late mother of the present queen Elizabeth II (r. 1952-). The Queen Mother wore this crown at her coronation in 1937. The diamond is set in a detachable mount made of platinum the same material the rest of the crown is made from. The crown is set with another 2 including the 17-carat diamond given to Queen Victoria by the Sultan of in gratitude for help during the Crimean War (1853-56). Although this square-cut stone is impressive in its own right it is dwarfed by the massive Koh-i-Noor set directly above it. The Queen Mother wore this crown at the State Opening of Parliament each year and at the coronation of her daughter Elizabeth II in 1953. The crown and the Koh-i-Noor can be seen today alongside other items of the Crown Jewels in the Jewel House inside the Waterloo Barracks of the Queen Mary's Crown with Koh-i-Noor Diamond There have been repeated calls from the Indian government for the return of the Koh-i-Noor to its homeland. The first such request came in 1947 as the stone became a symbol of the country’s independence from British rule which had been achieved in the same year. Another player entered the debate in 1976 when the prime minister of Pakistan called for the return of the stone to his country. Iran and Afghanistan have also laid claim to the gemstone. The calls for the Koh-i-Noor’s return to the subcontinent have by no means died down a group of Indian investors even launched a legal process to have the diamond returned. As of today the British royal family remain reluctant to part with this most famous and desirable of diamonds. and the Performance of British Material Culture."" Dena K. Tarshis.

Yes after the election all the Democrat pols gave the usual clichés about cooperation with Trump on certain matters as if Trump were just some other Republican. That’s bad enough but this was something more. Gabbard was actually the Trump Administration. She denies it. She ludicrously claims this was just a and the need for peace. As if “peace” was uppermost in Trump’s mind now. As if he wasn’t spending all his time visiting Alt-Right sewers and billionaire clubs to staff his cabinet. On the Death of Fidel Castro – View of a Socialist Cuban Living Abroad with none of the usual leftist idolizing of Castro. We talk about Fidel's popularity in Cuba among the older generation his success in standing for Cubans against U.S. designs the dictatorial power he seized and some of the huge moves he made in Africa On Scott Ritter’s Attack on the White Helmets “The ‘White Helmets’ and the Inherent Contradiction of America’s Syria Policy” and see him joining the ranks of the conspiracists on Syria. They say that generals usually prepare for the last war.  This has happened to the peace movement too.  The anti-war coalitions in the U.S. and UK are acting as if this was 2003 and everyone need to focus on Western imperial adventures.  Instead circumstances are quite different. The main carnage right now has little to do with “the Empire”. A dictator from a family dynasty is using his entire military every weapon the country owns to bring a nation to heel.  He’s assisted (and in some ways commanded) by foreign powers the other a theocracy. The larger anti-war organizations and coalitions have nothing to say or bleat “Our main responsibility is to criticize our own government’s abuses” or airily call for all foreign forces to stop intervening .

1620764410.16029,30422977,https://newpol.org/no-joint-struggle-with-settler-colonialism/,"No Joint Struggle With Settler Colonialism the other with the dagger” 1954 Poster of the Histadrut the Zionist labor organization that carried out settlement and formed the backbone of the Haganah militia that perpetrated the ethnic cleansing of the 1948 Nakba. responds to Daniel Fischer’s “ .” Both articles refer to the anthology’s chapter “Not an Ally” by Daphna Thier. A summary of this and other chapters can be found in Steve Leigh’s the working class was the revolutionary class the only class for whose self-liberation would mean the liberation of all. In Daphna Thier’s chapter “Not An Ally” she argues that the Israeli working class is an exception to this rule. The reason for this is that the class character reflects the settler colonial nature of the Zionist state. The very class formation of the Israeli working class came with the ethnic cleansing and forced appropriation of Palestinian land and replacing Palestinian society with Israeli one. Zionist labor and labor parties both were essential actors and thus guilty parties. This Zionist welfare state served as the cocoon that gave birth to Israeli capitalism. She argues that Israeli workers are bestowed direct benefits at the expense of Palestinians and that a political economy constructed around the continued war and occupation of the Palestinians has more integrated the Israeli working class into the Zionist project. The result of this is that class struggle against Israeli capital is subordinated to the struggle for the Zionist national project. Deeper than the false consciousness of nationalism which exists as a strain within workers generally Zionist settle-colonialism shapes the class character to prevent the Israeli working class is a settler-colonial active collaborator with Israeli capitalism in the continued ethnic cleansing and occupation project of Israeli apartheid. Despite the actions of some individuals of conscience the class character and relationship to the state means that Israeli workers are not allies in the struggle for Palestinian liberation for democratic rights for all and for the right of return for the generations of Palestinian forced into the diaspora. This is an unfortunate reality that we wish were different. However it is folly to base our political strategy on this wish. Unfortunately Daniel Fischer asks us to make that very mistake in his criticism of Thier’s argument in the book edited by Sumaya Awad and myself. (He also singles out Steve Leigh for a favorable whose company I am happy to share.) Fischer’s main assertion is that we discount the “revolutionary potential” of the Israeli working class and he argues that rather than being incentivized to support Zionism Zionism is antithetical to the self-interest of Israeli workers and that it is only “false consciousness” that it is supported by the near totality of Israeli Jews.  Zionism—according to Fischer—has made Israel “hell for Jews.”  He argues that changing this and winning a shared country will come about with “joint mass struggle from below cemented by common national-revolutionary aims and common social interests” between Israeli Jews and Palestinians. In making his argument he relies on one of the writings of American socialist Hal Draper arguing the majority position of the American Trotskyist organization the Workers Party / International Socialist League. In doing so he resuscitates a doctrinaire debate in the international Trotskyist movement from mid-20th century. The majority position of the WP/ISL in this debate was quite mistaken in its approach to Israel. On this ground he makes a series of cases of struggle by Israeli Jews that are overblown—sometimes with misleading sources—and confuses activity against the excesses of the occupation or “for peace” with that of a clear anti-Zionist position. He makes some of the same mistakes that Draper and company made about the nature of the Israeli state and colonialism—mistakes our new socialist movement needs to reject. In the rest of this essay I will go through each of these in turn. Fischer makes his case by citing the existence of sporadic protests in Israel carried out by the Israeli peace movement against things like the apartheid wall and annexation the existence of Israeli military resisters and the Israeli Black Panther movement of the early 1970s. In many of these examples Fischer dramatically overstates the breadth or effect of these small struggles on Israeli society.  He downplays what Awad and Thier emphasize in their excellent recent Jacobin ; that the existence of Zionism prevents solidarity and the settler-colonialism is the underlying obstacle not just—and most importantly—for ending the suffering of Palestinians but to create the condition for the growth of any sort of internationalism among the Israeli working class. We don’t deny that there exists a small movement in Israel that protests the more egregious “overreaches” of Zionist occupation. This activity is welcome and positive. But the Israeli peace movement has not only been and Israeli politics on the level of working class organizations and political parties has lurched rightward. This is an obvious point and the Israeli as Awad and Thier point out in their Jacobin piece the actions of the peace movement might oppose the occupation but they should not be confused as being anti-Zionist and are at best uneven and confused on the right of return of Palestinian refugees—one of the most basic demands for justice in Palestine. Fischer overstates its reach and the impact of the small handful of examples he provides. (refusenik or military resister) movement similarly while important has been than one percent of total conscripts. Additionally the politics of many of the sarvanim groups while noble in acting against the occupation fall short of calling for an end to Zionism. ) still holds to an idea of a Zionist state albeit with the Green Line (the armistice line established in 1948) as its boundary. ) couches its motivation to refuse duty as a Zionist act to “preserve Israel’s safety.” Fischer insinuates that the fact that there has been an increase in people dodging the draft because of mental health exemptions is out of solidarity with the plight of Palestinians. And yet the he cites that the suicide rate for Israeli Jews is higher for that of Palestinians. The problem is that the piece he doesn’t include figures on Palestinians living in the occupied West Bank or Gaza and it also cites that the rate has for Israeli Jews over the past ten years not the case for Palestinian citizens of Israel. he overstates the impact of the Israeli Black Panthers. The Israeli Black Panthers were a group who organized against anti-Mizrahi racism in the 1970s and connected with the Palestinian resistance movement. They were an important and remarkable occurrence as Thier states in her chapter. However as Moshe Machover and E’hud Ein-Gil  who were members of (another group of revolutionary anti-Zionists that Fischer strangely doesn’t mention) that worked with and influenced the Israeli Panthers that the group is the “only partial exception” to the general thesis on the Israeli working class. Indeed in the instance of the Israeli Panthers as Panther founder Reuvin Abergel states in the piece cited by Fischer “ultimately Israel was successful in using Palestinians as a tool to force the Mizrahim into identifying with their Jewish over Arab identities.” The harsh crack-down on the Panthers was one reason for the collapse of the organization but the other piece of the puzzle is that the trend in Mizrahi politics in the roughly 50 years since has shifted right as Thier describes in her chapter and Otman Aitlkaboud in his excellent two-part piece on the legacy of the group. The Black Panthers being an exception does not disprove the rule. And even the fate of the Israeli Black Panthers seems to confirm the powerful force that settler colonialism plays to dampen class conflict and oppression within the Israeli working class. Fischer’s examples aren’t really about current working class activity. And that’s at the heart of the issue. Because if we believe that the force for revolutionary change is the working class then it’s their activity as a class that we look to. As another example if you look at his citing of the letter against the Nation State Law it is a list of 60 academics or lawyers. Not exactly the base of the working class. Fischer seems to be aware of some of these general trends in Israeli politics as he notes several times in his essay how prevalent anti-Arab racism is among Israeli Jews and the complete lack of support for either BDS or for a democratic shared country. So while all the examples that he mentions to prove his point are legit and positive he overstates their breadth and impact and is unable to explain why movements like the Panthers and these others have continually for the entirety of the existence of the state of Israel not resonated with the Israeli working class and why the Israeli left has played a role supporting politically and carrying out the occupation.  Fischer barely engages with Thier’s careful materialist analysis explaining “why” demonstrating how Israeli capitalism was built through investment of Israeli working class and socialist institutions and parties in a Zionist state. Simple descriptions of false consciousness are not sufficient and is akin to the errors made by Draper of misunderstanding and downplaying Israeli settler-colonialism. One final consequence of this is his handling of Hamas. Skewed similarly to Draper’s emphasis on “defense of Israel” which I will describe later Fischer describes Hamas as simply a “far-right group that intentionally kills Israeli civilians.” Socialists should chafe at this simple description.  While I certainly have criticisms of Hamas any criticism has to be balanced with the fact that they were democratically elected by Palestinians in 2006.  Also independent of any opinion about the effectiveness of the armed struggle against the occupation is the fact that armed resistance to occupation is legal under international law of Geneva treaties and United Nations . And it bears to mention that this is in contradistinction to Israeli occupation and its multiple human rights resolutions. It should be a simple socialist maxim to say we defend occupied peoples’ rights to resist in whatever way they see fit even if we have an opinion on its effectiveness. When Israel is continually blockading Gaza bombing one of the most densely populated places on earth Hamas should be defended against the political attacks used to justify these war crimes.  Unfortunately Hamas being “a far-right group that intentionally kills Israeli civilians” is essentially the political attack that we need to defend against. However Fischer downplays making a clear defense of resistance and being able to push back against a frankly Islamophobic characterizations of Hamas that uses the fantasy of “joint struggle” and the need to “make Israeli Jews invited” as justification. I am aware that the United States also was born out of a settler colonial context. He accuses my comrades and myself of “lacking consistency” because we don’t argue that the working class of the United States is the same as the working class of Israel. It is the case that in a book we don’t articulate our views on the US working class and its relationship to the country’s settler-colonial origins. That question is essential and rich and it is unfortunate that Fischer’s critique here feels a bit disingenuous as he engages in an argument we don’t make in the book. Additionally he expresses no disagreement with what he thinks our position is on the US working class but just on our inconsistency.  On this point there deserves a fuller description. the notion that the fact that settler colonialism and the working class of Israel are as that of the United States seems a stretch. From the beginning of this country through around the turn of the 20th century—as Brian Ward out in “Are You a Settler”—settler colonialism was expressed in the very overt drive for the non-Native population displacing Indigenous folks and directly benefiting from that appropriation. In this time period of the US working class and what we are saying about the Israeli working class is probably more apt. But as Nick Estes—the founder of Red Nation—points out in his book Our History Is the Future: Standing Rock Versus the Dakota Access Pipeline and the Long Tradition of Indigenous Resistance has shifted throughout US history. One of the features of this is that the primary beneficiaries of settler colonialism have shifted. Estes points out that while there are still settlers and descendants of settlers in the conventional sense it is large corporations—especially in the extractive sector who play this role. This feature—of US settler colonialism largely being driven by Capital is different than the current settler colonial project of Israel which still seeks to displace indigenous Palestinian people to make landowners of individual and collective Jewish workers. to be done towards liberation in this so-called country and fights around and re-matriation are essential. But still this is just different from the immediacy of the contemporary project of Zionism.  Unlike Zionism one can point out how class struggle against the US capital in these issues can be waged and cross-class unity against Indigenous folks is not as central a feature in the general class character.  As Jewish workers occupy the privileged status of never having to compete for jobs with Palestinians it means that they don’t solidarity with Palestinian workers. This need to fight the ability for the bosses to divide worker against worker is what drove the important labor struggles for interracial unions in the United States.  These traits and others about what makes Zionism different are the very arguments that Thier makes. The validity of this argument stands independent of what one thinks or does not think about the current nature of settler colonialism in the United States. Responding to Fischer’s central use of Draper and the WP/ISL’s doctrinaire and misinformed approach to Palestine means a bit getting into the weeds of old debates to explore the context.  But as Fischer uses the Draper article as his critique’s central argument and as I do sometimes enjoy the musty corridors of Marxist history The debate in question occurred mostly between that of Max Shachtman’s Workers Party / International Socialist League and that of the more “orthodox” Trotskyism of the Fourth International(FI) who expelled them from the US organization in 1940. It is important that this debate was not just between groups but Trotskyists have almost always held to anti-Zionism.  With that in the post-war period the debate emerged first around the question of Jewish immigration to Palestine (which began in the late 1800s) then on the United Nations-driven partition plan then on the Nakba itself. The general majority position in this debate advanced by the FI that the WP/ISL polemicized against was opposition to Jewish immigration to Palestine. In the wake of the genocide of the Holocaust in Germany they advocated for solidarity to get other countries to allow the entry of Jews but argued that immigration to Palestine was a “terrible trap” according to Ernest Mandel in as “the Arab masses must necessarily look upon the arrival of new immigrants as the arrival of ; and this point of view is confirmed by the way in which the Jewish masses look upon this immigration.” Mandel argued that the basis for the question of Jewish immigration must “start from “the sovereignty of the Arab population.” The insightful of Palestinian-born Tony Cliff was influential to the FI position. While one could criticize the FI for having too much of a towards Arab resistance to the Nakba the general approach to the nature of the Zionism and its relationship to Zionist settlers and class formation can be seen as loosely corresponding with a description of the settler-colonial nature of the Israeli state. The WP/ISL sharply criticized this position. Albert Glotzer leans the entirety of his critique on the position that “the fate of the Jews are sealed.” The “existence of bourgeois society” for Glotzer would mean the complete extermination of Jewish people in every country in the world and that literally nothing could be done about it. While the pessimism of this position is connected to the recent events of the Holocaust it is a prediction that—though antisemitism is still a real threat—has certainly been proven incorrect in the dire way motivating Glotzer’s claims. he argues that the self-determination of world Jewry demands that the “only correct socialist slogan” would be for the free immigration of Jews to Palestine and furthermore that socialists should adopt it “despite the opposition” of Palestinians. Practically this meant that despite Palestinian resistance—most notably the three years of mass struggle of the at the end of the 1930’s— to what was seen correctly by Palestinians as a project of colonization backed by British imperialism in 1946 arguing for the building of a united front against Britain’s refusal at the time to ease restrictions on immigration and in support of 18 members of the Irgun—the Zionist militia that would go on to carry out and massacres against Palestinians during the Nakba—who were arrested by the British. While the WP/ISL opposed the 1947 UN-sponsored partition plan their misreading of the situation elevation of self-determination as sacrosanct principle beyond all context and bungled failure to understand the colonial dynamics at play meant that their writings at the time on the establishment of the state of Israel should make one cringe. Hal Draper wrote the editorial for the WP/ISL’s newspaper on May 24th in response to Israel’s declaration of its statehood and after about 6 weeks of the organized “Plan Dalet” campaign of ethnic cleansing and massacres carried out by Zionist militia.⁵ Entitled “ ” Draper argues that the events of ethnic cleansing were merely self-defense against a “reactionary war of invasion” and calls for lifting of embargos on sending arms to the Zionist militias. Socialists are “required” to defend Zionists right to “defend their choice of separate national existence against any and all reactionary attempts to deprive them of that right.” Palestinians in Draper’s piece literally do not exist as all resistance is described as entirely the domain of the “reactionary feudal Arab ruling class.” This a tragic erasure of the agency of Palestinians suffering and resisting their forced expulsion from their home. While he calls for unity between Jews and Arabs and the furtherance of a socialist state with equal rights etc he argues that Arabs are unfit for this task because “it is the Jews who are the most advanced socially and culturally because it is they who claim to be socialists.” He argued this in 1956 that because of “superior cultural and technical resources” Israel could be a “beneficent leader and guide” to the Arab people. This is a heinous position to take by a distinguished by campaigning against the idea that socialism can be brought from above or without. The piece concludes with Draper saying that without a socialist program the “sacrifices of the Jewish people and the military victories of the Haganah will not be able to make of Palestine anything but a deathtrap.” So therefore colonialism—and the “victory” of ethnic cleansing that the Haganah were responsible for— and could be a simple expression of the principle of self-determination. In a piece written a few months later called “How to Defend Israel” he argues not that the colonial project is flawed but that the error is that what is needed is the giving of the “victory a social meaning.” By not viewing the events of the creation of the state of Israel as the expression the project of settler colonialism Draper give socialist colors to a violent colonial project and makes arguments quite congruent with the many of the liberal (and racist) justifications for Zionism (only democracy in the “backwards” Middle East land without a people for people without a land etc.). This is the key ghastly error of Draper and his co-thinkers. These positions were formalized by a passed by the International Socialist League in 1951. The resolution articulates these same arguments and distill a key argument they make which is that socialists should be for the abstract right of self-determination of peoples independent of the advisability of the exercise of that right by separation organizations etc. In the abstract this formulation this is largely correct and draws on Lenin’s important work on national self-determination. But as Tony Cliff before the Nakba: “only the greatest superficiality can drive one to the conclusion that this slogan holds good at all times and under all conditions.” In the case of Palestine its abstraction floats obliviously above the fact that there was no idea of the Jewish nation state in Palestine that was not Zionist. a member of the Progressive Socialist Party of Lebanon which was associated with the country’s Druze minority.⁶ It was Maksoud’s piece—published in in 1954—critical of WP/ISL position that was the target of the Draper’s polemic quoted by Fischer. Many of Maksoud’s points have been proven largely correct by the decades since. Maksoud argues that the WP/ISL “made a fundamental error” by identifying the resistance to Israel as only the domain of the Arab ruling class who try to “pervert it to their selfish ends.” Rather resistance to Israel was also a part of a “much broader fight” of the struggle against imperialism. It is actually the state of Israel—argued Maksoud—that’s presence in the region “acts a deterrent to the revolutionary aspirations of the Arab masses.” Because of this he argues that Western socialists who “continue their one-sided support for Israel” they will “contribute to the perpetuation of reaction in the area.” Maksoud also takes the WP/ISL to task for embracing the “widely held Zionist-theory that Arabs are incapable of developing their own areas.” And lastly he skewers the WP/ISL focus on an abstract notion of self-determination as being the main issue.  He argues that their position: “Disregards the means by which this right is to be executed and it denies the interests of the people in Palestine their sovereign right to admit or refuse these claims. In other words what is claimed by the resolution to be an act of Jewish ‘self-determination’ is dependent for its fruition on an act of aggression and imposition.” but on several on his main points he is dead on and the analysis of Israel’s role in the region and the connection of the struggle to Palestine to anti-imperialism has—unlike the socialist vanguard fantasy advanced by the Draper—proved completely correct and the chapter in our book by Shireen Akram-Boshar demonstrates this expertly. His conclusion is that what is needed is the end (emasculation as he calls it) to an explicitly Zionist state and the right of return to Palestinian refugees.⁷ It was in response to Maksoud’s arguments that Draper wrote the ” that Fischer uses in his piece. In it Draper lays out an opposition to Zionism the general need for joint struggle from below regionally and the need for a democratic state. But the argument of the need for “joint struggle” that Fischer focuses on is used by Draper to buttress the main point of his piece which is polemicizing against the overthrow of the Zionist state. Draper states he is not “for” a Zionist state but expresses the need to assert the need to defend its current existence. Its confused contradictions are the product of the complete absence of any analysis of Zionism being a project. He dreams of an Israel that “overcomes its Zionist illusions and policies.” Israel and “self-determination” are rendered power-neutral seen only question is that of two “nations” just figuring out “how people in the region can live together.” This abstract take on self-determination also means that in the same piece he bizarrely argues that white South Africans should be supported (even if we disagree with them) if they chose to establish a white-only separatist state in South Africa. But as the South African Trotskyist Hosea Jaffe : “We cannot consider the shell of a slogan without its substance.” Draper’s emphasis on joint struggle is expressed as a counter-position to arguments about the need to end the Zionist state its role as vanguard of regional reaction and the need for a right of return. It is easy to talk about joint struggle if you skip over the analysis of the settler-colonial situation and its effect on class formation. It is easy to as Draper did two years later an extensive ten-point program (which includes the right-of-return) for how Israel can “win support” of the Arab masses “against their own reactionary rulers” and think that the Zionist state has any interest in dissolving its foundations as a settler colonial ethnostate and abandon the imperial sponsorship that makes the whole endeavor possible. Colonialism never happened only “self-determination.” Socialists should be clear we don’t support the self-determination for colonial settlers who are a part of imperialist occupation projects. Of all this Fischer says that what “Draper contended in 1954 is still true today.” Fischer’s use of Draper here—which feels like a “gotcha” because he makes a point that we quote Drapers writings on Marxism but “unfortunately” don’t talk about his earlier espousal of the WP/ISL position on Israel—is actually the choice less fortunate. In doing so he resuscitates this debate in the international Trotskyist movement and the doctrinaire mistaken approach of  WP/ISL on Israel. This position on Palestine held by the WP/ISL by now mostly a historical curio of the left should remain that way as the argument in its wooden estimation of Lenin’s approach to the national question comes dangerously close to ignoring Israel’s perpetration of the Nakba on Palestinians ignores Palestinians agency and right of return. It lacks an analysis of the settler-colonial nature of the Zionists state and have been shown to be wrong in the sixty years since they were made. None of this is to say that the politics of socialism from below or of Draper are corrupted. Indeed I revere his work generally and myself and the people named in Fischer’s critique consider themselves in his loose tradition. Additionally it is a marker of his political strength that in the 1950s he argued for the right of return etc.  But in his handling of the nature of the Zionist state and class character of the Israeli working class he was wrong. There are some signs that his position might have shifted some as after the piece that Fischer quoted some of his criticism of Israel become sharper and his tone in the last as the Six-Day War was beginning actually talks about Nakba still has the “conflict between two sides” context that is a product of his misunderstanding of the colonial nature but is less Panglossian about the progessive potential of Israel. Was Drapers position shifting as he viewed more the trajectory of Zionism? This is uncertain. But what is certain is that it is one thing for Draper to make a political error in the 1940s & 1950s or to have hope for the Israeli Black Panthers in the 1970s; it is another to double down on this wrong position having witnessed the past forty years of the political development of Zionism. Fischer’s argument against the position argued by Thier and others is flawed. To justify this he overstates the breadth and potential of the examples that he uses and misses the overarching and underlying structures that have informed developments in Israeli political economy. There is difference between instances and trends that are important to political strategy. For example I think that in the course of the struggle for socialism it is likely that there may be some billionaires who may be won to the side of socialism.  However to organize your political strategy for the expropriation of billionaires on winning them over is a dead-end folly. I do have hope for the Israeli working class but the main driver and focus of our strategy is changing the situation on the ground the colonial reality and upsetting the Zionist blockage to solidarity will come about primarily not from the Israeli working class but through the regional uprising of the Arab working class and from Palestinians themselves.  They are who we should look to. That is what it means to be consistent in your approach to liberation in Palestine. 1 Of course the term Nakba is not used by any of the pieces I am discussing here. 2 It is notable that though the FI statement on the Nakba at the time does seek to straddle the divide with its “against all chauvinism” thrust it does—unlike the position of the WP/ISL which I will describe later—include the important demand:“For the right of the Arab masses to determine their own future.” 3 US immigration restrictions affecting Jewish immigrants from Europe that were criminally narrow during the Holocaust were lifted in 1948. 4 For more on Palestinian resistance pre-1948 see pg 55 in 5 For more on Plan Dalet see Ilan Pappé 6 It is also important to note that it is a testament to the WP/ISL’s attention to democracy and political debate that they printed a two-part criticism of their politics from someone not in their organization in their paper. It is also interesting to note Maksoud’s political trajectory to becoming a prominent Arab League diplomat and ambassador to the United States. 7 One point of debate between Maksoud and Draper that I will not take up here but flag is the question of what kind of “national rights” would there be in a single democratic state. 8 An astute reader could respond to this question and point to the preface right before his death where he says that his line on Israel/Palestine has been proven right because it is carried by the PLO in 1990. This is a highly ambiguous and uncharastically imprecise for Draper.  Which part of the line? Its criticism of Zionism? The bi-national state? Class character of Israeli working class? Also is the fact that the PLO advocates it necessarily mean it is correct especially on the dawn of Oslo? brian bean is a Chicago-based socialist activist and speaker originally from North Carolina. He is one of the founding editors of magazine and a member of the socialist collective. His work has been published in right? Isn’t that worth a few bucks -maybe more?  Please timely analysis unswerving in its commitment to struggles for peace has called “socialism” for a half-century. No Joint Struggle With Settler Colonialism Mr. Bean writes  that the “main driver and focus of our strategy is changing the situation on the ground the colonial reality and upsetting the Zionist blockage to solidarity will come about primarily not from the Israeli working class but through the regional uprising of the Arab working class and from Palestinians themselves.  They are who we should look to.” Just as there is no chance that the Israeli Jewish working class will support the dismantling of Israel as a Jewish state there is no hope that an uprising of the Arab working class could accomplish this objective.  The Arab working class has never played an independent role in any conflict in the Arab world.  Further the Palestinian uprisings i.e. the two intifadas have not brought the Palestinians any closer to their “liberation.” Israel is here to stay. It can be reformed to improve the status of its Palestinian Arab minority but it cannot be abolished. Israel is too strong and its Jewish population is loyal. Even a two state solution is out of reach for various reasons including the Palestinian insistence on the right of return of millions of refugees and their descendants from 1947 onward  It is absurd to expect any Israeli government  to agree BOTH to the creation of a Palestinian state in the occupied territories AND the return to refugees and their descendants to the Jewish state. Looking for a practical solution?  Both sides should resurrect the Geneva Accords for this excellent critique of Hal Draper’s misapplication of the right of self-determination to Zionism and the Nakba. Draper did not share Stalin’s motives for supporting a Jewish state in Palestine. Rather his position was rooted in binationalism — the same premise shared by Socialist Zionists of the Hashomer Hatzair — that Jews have an equal right to self-determination in Palestine including a right to a *separate* state. Jewish and Palestinian workers were to unite for a “socialist” Israel. To put this into perspective it is like saying that as communities suffering oppression in Europe the Boers in apartheid South Africa or European immigrants in Americas had the right to a separate — i.e. apartheid — state on stolen indigenous land. Socialist Zionism Panel at Socialism 2017 Conference The One State Solution should not be confused with a “binational” state an anti-democratic concept first formulated in the 1930s by “left wing” Zionists of the Hashomer Hatzair and apparently advocated by Israeli Marxist Moshe Machover. In this context Jews *as a group* would have equal weight to the indigenous Palestinian population and the right to a separate is based on the false premise that all Jews constitute a distinct oppressed “people” or “nation.” Is Israel an Apartheid State? it seems that chapter 9 here suggets a different take on these very issues: It is not true that ALL Jews constitute a nation. Jews born in Israel DO constitute a Hebrew Nation. Matzpen (the Israeli Socialist Organization) got it right in the ’60s. and against the Israeli policies of partnership with imperialism must not be confused with a chauvinist struggle against the Israeli people itself and with an attempt to penalise the Israeli masses for the sins of Zionism or with a denial of the right of the Israeli nation to self-determination. If the struggle of the Arab people is guarded from such falsification it can grow into a joint Arab-Jewish struggle against imperialism for socialism and the interests common to both peoples.” If Israeli Marxists understood this 1968 every avowed Marxist around the world should be able understand it today. Writing off the Israeli-Jewish working class as a “bad people” merely ensures the permanence of an apartheid state in all of historic Palestine for decades to come. And if we’re going to talk about South Africa and use it as an argument against binationalism I refer Cde. Letwin to this article: “These findings necessitate a rethinking of interpretation of late apartheid politics of inclusion and exclusion. Contrary to existing understandings it reveals white workers’ precarious position in the racial state and their often hostile relationship with white elites. Contestations around reform and citizenship in the late apartheid period was not just between the white state and African masses. Rather white workers’ experiences and interests show that class position colored racial standing and attenuated citizenship in the racial state even at the height of apartheid.” Your email address will not be published. to allow us to continue bringing you independent You can make a tax-deductible contribution by clicking .

Yes but so have your remote work opportunities. Here is a five-week strategy to fast-track your job search. Week 1: Update your résumé to highlight transferable job skills. To show you are adaptable generalize the skills on your résumé into three main areas: systems-oriented Week 2: Improve your personal brand on LinkedIn and make your profile visible. Make sure hiring managers see your LinkedIn profile by using keywords to land more search results Week 3: Conduct informational interviews with potential co-workers. These conversations might land you an informational interview or they might guide you toward other potential opportunities. Week 4: Ask for job search referrals from your connections. Getting a job search referral usually guarantees that your application will be seriously considered Week 5: Prepare for your virtual job interview. Craft a few questions catered to the company or projects they’ve launched that catch your interest. Job and life advice for young professionals. See more from Ascend There’s no other way to put it: Finding a job during Covid-19 is hard. If you are looking to land a new role your success depends largely on hiring trends and the economy both of which are working against you right now. Hiring fell to a While the economic downturn has tilted the market in favor of employers many companies are financially strained and lack the resources to survive another lockdown. Nearly have permanently closed since the pandemic began. Together these factors amount to increased competition for scarce positions and extreme stress for job candidates. you may feel powerless right now but rest assured — this is not entirely true. Yes but so have your opportunities. Remote work has expanded talent pools and fostered more diversity in hiring. Before the pandemic the majority of recruiters were limited to candidates located in their cities. Today virtual work environments have freed up companies to search for talent regardless of location. Now is the time to embrace these opportunities and form a strategic approach to your application process. Even though you can’t control the ebb and flow of the market there are still ways that you can make yourself a marketable candidate. Through my work as the CEO and founder of Cheeky Scientist a job search training platform for people with PhDs I have developed a five-week strategy to fast-track the job search — and anyone at any stage of their career Before you even begin to look you need to know your odds. Companies hiring top talent often spend the first few months of every year focused on corporate strategy instead of recruitment which will typically hinder your job search between January and March. After this initial rough patch the market hits peaks and valleys based on the state of the economy which explains the increase in unemployment during the pandemic. tend to surge upward again at the end of the year because companies want to devote any leftover budget to new talent. The traditional “dead zone” of January through March will likely be exaggerated in 2021 as large companies recover from the effects of Covid-19 so don’t be disheartened if you fail to land a job before April. This summer may be the best time to actively search for and interact with potential employers before the September through December hiring surge. People talk about the importance of having “transferable skills” on your résumé all the time but what do they really mean? are all of the things you’re good at that can be applied to various roles in various industries. For example and problem-solving are all examples of what would be considered “transferable skills.” The fancier definition of this term is “an ability that isn’t highly specialized.” Non-transferable skills ” are specific to certain industries You might have been told to tailor your résumé for each role you apply for but from what I’ve seen that strategy won’t work in 2021. Many companies are nervous about hiring more specialized candidates because they’re unsure what the business landscape will look like after the pandemic. To show you are adaptable generalize the skills on your résumé into three main areas: systems-oriented are associated with your areas of expertise. Under each role listed on your résumé try to phrase these skills in a practical way to show how they can apply to a variety of positions and industries not just your specified field. For example suppose you worked as a content creator at a software company. In that case highlight “business writing” on your résumé and specify what you mean by including more distinct tasks — like creating blog posts or writing marketing emails — under your role. Doing so will help prove that you can apply this skill to any job rather than just at a software company. highlight your ability to communicate with colleagues. Right now companies value candidates who can collaborate remotely and have the potential to lead virtual teams. On your résumé be sure to include keywords like performance management either under a particular role or a separate “skills” section at the bottom of your résumé to demonstrate your ability to collaborate and lead. tell your potential employer that you can work diligently and apply new solutions to existing problems like the ones caused by the shift to remote work (decreasing productivity etc.). You might think of these as “soft” skills but they are in demand and will help you stand out as companies continue to decentralize their workforces. Words like “autonomy ” and “self-starter” show employers you can stay on task If you have been using a chronological résumé but are struggling to get responses from employers or if you are trying to enter an industry you have no previous experience in try mixing things up by showcasing your transferable skills first — even before your job titles. Use them as headers under the experience section on your résumé. sticking with the content creator example Bullet point about your specific responsibilities. listing transferable skills before your experiences can lead to better callback outcomes. When candidates failed to get a response with a chronological résumé we found that this more functional format was effective 21% of the time. Meanwhile (combining a functional skills list with chronological work experience) and sidebar résumé formats (focusing on scannability) were only effective 3% and 2% of the time Many employers will read only the bolded portions of your work experience section before contacting you so highlight your transferable skills accordingly. Week 2: Improve your personal brand on LinkedIn and make your profile visible. The narrative behind your career path is critical when you’re trying to stand out in an employer’s market. Companies want to know where you’ve been and how it has shaped you as a professional. This will help them understand your value even before you land an interview. Make sure hiring managers see your LinkedIn profile by to land more search results. Just like you use Google to find specific information hiring managers use LinkedIn to search for candidates. To start copy the descriptions of 10 similar jobs that interest you and paste them into a . The most common words are the ones you should incorporate into the various sections on your profile. You’ll also want to include your desired job location (even if you’re targeting remote positions) to catch the attention of recruiters who are searching for candidates using location-based keywords. you should upload a professional — but friendly — picture and consider personalizing your banner photo. Profiles with a photo receive and nine times more connection requests than those without them. Banners should follow a cohesive color scheme and shouldn’t be too complex or busy. If you want to make your banner really pop try listing three to five keywords or transferable skills at the top of your image You can also grab an employer’s attention by engaging with your network. Think of LinkedIn as a way to show off your expertise. Attract more people to your page by liking and commenting on posts related to trends in your industry publishing text-only posts (which receive and regularly searching for connections. Increasing your activity on LinkedIn is a fast way to elevate your Social Selling Index (LinkedIn’s metric for success in terms of your personal brand) which helps increase your visibility to employers. or opt out at any time by managing your Week 3: Conduct informational interviews with potential co-workers. An informational interview is a conversation you can have with another professional to learn more about their career or industry. Unlike a job interview the goal isn’t to get hired; you’re trying to educate yourself. In your job search this type of interview serves two purposes: It allows you to gather intel on companies that are hiring. It helps you form connections with employees at those companies. you can learn about open positions . You might even gain referrals to roles you’re interested in pursuing. A great way to start is by reaching out to your existing network. Talk to school alumni and friends who might work at or know someone employed by an organization you’re interested in. These conversations might land you an informational interview or they might guide you toward other potential opportunities (like a company or position you hadn’t considered before). If you have your heart set on a certain organization another option is to use LinkedIn to connect with someone who works there. It’s best to choose someone who holds a position similar to or cross-functional to the one you’re seeking. The goal is to find someone who can credibly answer the questions you have. show them that you are a valuable contact by first offering to connect them with someone who could benefit them professionally or personally (if you can). Keep your request concise and be specific about the topic you would like to discuss and the time commitment you’re seeking: I noticed your team is looking to learn more about [topic or service]. I deeply admire your organization’s work around [mission] so I wanted to reach out and let you know I have a connection to [person] who may be a valuable contact. I don’t want to take up too much of your time but I’d love to jump on a 10-minute phone call to provide you with their information and talk about your company. I’m a big fan of [cite their work] and would love to learn more about [their role]. Are you by chance available to chat in the next couple of weeks?” If you don’t have a contact to offer up then it’s best to be upfront about your intentions. Begin your message by saying something specific about their organization — or even better their personal work — and then go in with your request: I saw the recent post you shared on [topic] and I really appreciated your commentary about [cite their work]. I noticed you work in [industry or company] which is an area I’m really passionate about. I was wondering whether you might have time for an informational interview in the next couple of weeks. I’d love to learn more about the work you do and how you got to where you are.” come prepared with a few questions and try to keep the tone of the conversation casual. The nice thing about informational interviews is that they are low stakes for both parties. So while you should be professional don’t treat the process too formally. Whoever you end up speaking with be sure to end the call by sincerely thanking them for the meeting: I just wanted to let you know that I really appreciate the time you spent talking to me about [company]. I learned a lot about [topic]. Please let me know if there’s anything else you’d like to talk about that I may be familiar with or if I can connect you to someone professionally.” you might also ask whether there is anyone else who they might suggest you contact to learn more. Taking the time to have this conversation will show that you care enough about a position enough to reach out before the application process which already places you ahead of more passive candidates. Week 4: Ask for job search referrals from your connections. If you made any good connections during your informational interviews in week three ask your contact for a referral before you apply to the role at their organization. This is important because getting a job search referral shows potential employers that another person is confident in your skills and it’s usually a guarantee that your application will be seriously considered — which increases your odds of getting called in for an interview. It’s best to follow up with your contact no sooner than one week after your informational interview to avoid bombarding them. being honest from the start about your goals while providing your contact with ideas for how they can assist you in your professional job search: hank you again for talking with me about [company]. Learning about [topic] during our conversation made me realize how much I’d like to work for your company. I’m interested in applying for the position of [title and link to job description] and I wanted to ask whether you could refer me or if you’d be willing to pass my résumé on to the hiring manager.” the pandemic has become the great equalizer in today’s economy. Job candidates are no longer selected based on location or attendance at live networking events. If you have references who can speak to your experience and abilities you’ll go further than candidates who don’t. Week 5: Prepare for your virtual job interview. conduct plenty of research so that you are up to date on recent news surrounding the company you’re applying to as well as trends happening in your industry. You can usually find these updates on their website and social media channels or by setting Google alerts for the company’s name and key players. This step is especially important if time has elapsed since you originally applied. I’d also recommend looking into the person who will be interviewing you provided you’re able to gather that information from your recruiter beforehand. Check out their LinkedIn and Twitter profiles to learn more about their career path and interests. craft a few questions catered to the company or projects they’ve launched that catch your interest. You should also come up with a few questions specifically about your interviewer and their work. This will immediately set you apart from other candidates by showing your genuine passion and curiosity for them and their organization. In terms of what you will be asked know that many employers are concerned about work-life balance in the remote work era. That said I can almost guarantee queries like “How do you stay productive?” and “What’s your daily routine?” will come up. Prepare your answer beforehand to showcase your ability to prioritize tasks and manage time. when it comes to your physical presence know that you will likely be interviewing remotely as well. The having an appropriate environment (go with a plain background) lighting yourself from the front to avoid appearing like a shadow figure (use a and making eye contact to appear confident (look into the webcam). To this list Dress in neutral colors on top and go with a business casual outfit even if the company culture seems casual. Your effort will show the interviewer that you’re serious about the hiring process. Make it a point to show that you are engaged in the conversation by nodding saying “yes” in agreement when the other person is talking and using hand gestures to emphasize important points.

It is their problem to solve when you are trying to excel inside of these environments it’s a lot to go up against. author Lan Nguyen Chaplin shares her personal story about fighting for her role as a tenured professor in academia. She provides readers with a handful of tools that she has developed over the years to protect herself and her mental health in an industry built to hold her back. Job and life advice for young professionals. See more from Ascend decades now. My colleagues would probably describe me as someone with “an upbeat personality ” who’s obsessed with learning and being a good peer. I might even describe myself or the side of me that shows up for work every day that lives in me too. I’m an Asian American woman who has fought her way into the position of tenured professor. I’m the daughter of Vietnamese refugees who came to the U.S. to build a better life. I’m the youngest of 14 children and the mother of two. And while I consider my background one of many blessings and am grateful for the doors that have opened for me I’ve also faced a great deal of racism and sexism throughout my career as a result of who I am and where I come from. You observe things from a special vantage point when you live in a world and work in an industry that was built to hold you back. When I taught my first MBA class of nearly 60 students whispers infiltrated the room the moment I walked up to the podium. A student yelled out “How long have you been teaching?” was unsurprising. I’m petite and have been told that I “look and sound” young often. When people think about what a successful professor they usually think of a white man: Women represent only 22% of full professors or those employed at the highest rank. of full professors are female and Asian in all of academia. I turned to my student and said what I always say: “I’m a lot younger than I look.” Like many women in my position I’ve become savvy at responding to these kinds of comments and occurrences. You observe things from a special vantage point when you live in a world and work in an industry that was built to hold you back. The of people who have never questioned their right to take up space or fought to be heard becomes obvious. If you’re a woman a woman of color in a predominantly white field Whether you work in academia or not whether you are seasoned or just beginning your career there are going to be times when you enter a space that doesn’t welcome you with open arms. In almost every industry women of color receive less support making it much more difficult to advance our careers in rank and pay. This kind of discrimination needs to be addressed at the institutional and leadership levels. It is their problem to solve when you are trying to excel inside of these environments it’s a lot to go up against. I want to share with you a handful of tools I’ve developed over the years to protect myself and my mental health in an industry that I was never meant to succeed in. Take the ones that feel right for you and use them to disrupt the system that is getting in your way. The most important lesson I’ve learned over the years: There is power in numbers and this is true at every level of an institution. favor those who look like them meaning those in positions of power tend to look and think in similar ways. It’s harder for women of color to establish networks that can help them navigate their careers in predominantly white industries. the “model minority” myth made this difficult for me in my early career. I came from a low-income family with limited economic resources and a lack of social networks and yet I was expected to excel with little structural support. The myth not only erases the individual struggles Asian Americans face but also ignores the role racism plays in the struggles of other racial/ethnic groups it pits people of color against each other when we should really be allies. To create any kind of change our voices need to be heard. The more voices there are the louder we will be. This knowledge is your secret sauce: Use it to connect with people in your office or at your institution who may feel disconnected and overlooked themselves. Your ally can be an inclusive leader who wants to confront bad behavior and overturn patterns of injustice at the top. This person can create forward momentum for you by drawing attention to your contributions and recommending you for opportunities that advance your career. You can find them by asking around (“What’s it like to work with … ?”). If they are worth connecting with they will appreciate your initiative and reply to your email — if you keep it short and to the point. Your ally can also be someone at your rank who will put in the work to listen to you and act on what they’ve learned. This is the person in the room who you hold in high esteem who holds you in high esteem as well. Take their support and keep paying it forward. Expand your network of allies and continue to support people from other marginalized groups. When people make assumptions based on my appearance I don’t assume they are hurting me on purpose but the pain is palpable. Every year I watch people act on their and potential. Well-intentioned staff comment “You’re such a cute China doll ” “You’re exotic. You’ve got big eyes for an Asian.” Well-intentioned students swear “You don’t look like a professor “I thought you were one of us.” Well-intentioned people ask ?” All believe that their words are compliments. or seemingly kind a bias is it has the same outcome: inequality and re-opened wounds. In my case not being viewed as a professor translates to not being respected as a leader or deserving of my rank. Not being viewed as an American translates to not belonging — a feeling I have been battling since childhood. even though the issue lives at the institutional level I was only allowed to speak to my parents in their first language. They raised me to take pride in our heritage I still struggled to feel like I was Vietnamese. Morning kindergarten class and afternoon Mister Rogers taught me English and U.S. culture I still struggled to feel like a “real American.” even though the issue lies at the institutional level it’s personal. For my own mental health for my survival and growth I’ve had to get comfortable confronting these biases when they . Because it’s what I can control. Because its effective. Because I need to set boundaries to focus on what matters: my work. This was not easy to do when I was just starting out but the more I practiced Here’s a (very) quick take on what I’ve learned about confronting biases: Schedule a private one-on-one meeting. Conversations that take place at the same eye-level in a neutral space are most respectful and therefore . This will remind you that not bad people. People grow and change. People have bad days. People say things without listening to what they actually said. Approach them with an interest in nurturing the professional relationship. Speak in a matter-of-fact tone. You want your message to take center stage or threats. Avoid inaccurate over-generalizations Don’t bring up past events that could be misconstrued as a personal attack and derail the conversation. Focus the conversation on a single incident. This will help the other person gain insight into what happened and why it was wrong whereas bringing up multiple incidents at once may feel overwhelming and cause the other person to shutdown entirely. make sure you can articulate and support your point with evidence. suggest a coffee break and reconnect in 10 minutes. to what the other person says when they respond. Have the intent of understanding where they are coming from. I find that asking questions helps clarify (“Can you please help me better understand … ?” “What did you mean by … ?”) End the meeting by thanking the other person for taking the time to engage and listen (“I’m glad you understand that … and you’ll work to … I now understand better …”) Ending the meeting this way nurtures the relationship. Pain usually accompanies growth. The biggest milestones in your young adulthood — moving away from home etc. — are going to come with challenges that are unique to you and your situation. People of color often face additional challenges because we have fewer resources to support us. Today a big part of my job in academia is doing just that: supporting and mentoring students of color. I love and value this work but I have also been punished for it throughout my career. Women are regularly stereotyped as being nice and warm. These positive traits supposedly make us women of color are tasked with the emotional labor of mentoring students who feel marginalized and women in general do which can decrease our research productivity and our chances of getting promoted. If you are also tasked with the emotional labor of mentoring others thank you! Your work is needed if this work is going unrecognized and decreasing your productivity in areas that are recognized you need to either stop saying yes to service or begin to work collaboratively with top leaders at your organization to build service into your reward model. Everyone in every industry but especially in higher education needs to be discussing how to create more diverse and inclusive environments. Your service is a part of advancing that mission meaning you should be rewarded equally — and you can and should be a part of this conversation. You’re powerful. You’re worthy. You deserve to take up space and be heard. reach out to people in positions of power at your organization or institution who have publicly shared their commitment to diversity and inclusion. A part of disrupting the system is not just asking these leaders to include you in their conversations but also inviting them into the conversations you are having around what needs to change. to align their commitment to DEI with your institution’s mission and values. If your experience is anything like mine you may have been expected to quietly “go along” for most of your life and now your career. The hidden message here is that people may want you to be non-confrontational and docile — a stereotype that is especially common for women of Asian descent. It took time when I speak up or do things differently than what is expected of me whether by students or other professors I’m still perceived as difficult and bossy sometimes. But — and you need to hear this sooner than later — the expectation that you should agree with a point you don’t support or go along with an idea without asking “how” or “why” is absurd. We should never forget that it is ultimately the responsibility of the institution and the organization to address these inequalities. Nevertheless there is a silver lining for us the individuals being affected. Although women of color often struggle with feelings of acceptance in many industries it is these same feelings that can ignite a fire in us. Use this fire to find purpose in your work and to challenge the status quo — something most of us have been practicing our entire lives. And do these things for yourself if and when they feel good. You’re powerful. You’re worthy. You deserve to take up space and be heard. is an Associate Professor of Marketing at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

Others may be shocked to learn the Internet existed back then.  Either way it has been a long time. I have seen web design trends come and go.  I've watched the web evolve from an assortment of stale that are common today.  During that time I have also seen many web development programs come and go.  But one that has remained through the years is Dreamweaver. has been around as long as I have been weaving dreams into websites.  But I preferred Adobe GoLive.  I reluctantly switched to Dreamweaver in 2007 when Adobe replaced GoLive with Dreamweaver after the Macromedia acquisition.  As far as I know Adobe acquired from Macromedia that the company still develops today. I am grateful that Adobe has continued maintaining Dreamweaver since it is my primary web development application.  Yes the team at Adobe has made several improvements to the application over the past several years.  It is much better than it was in 2012 when I wrote my last review. But there is one long-lasting bug that remains in the most recent version of Dreamweaver released last month.  It has persisted for at least ten years and is comical enough that I felt it deserved its own PC.net article. The Dreamweaver Site Settings window allows you to choose which side of the ""Files"" window to display your local files.  The default setting is ""Right "" which is not consistent with any program I have ever used.  I imagine roughly 100% of developers change this.  But that's not the You can choose to show either local files or remote files on the left.  AND you can choose to display either local files or remote files on the right.  There are effectively four ways to select a maximum of two possible options. Gotcha — they're the same thing! Dreamweaver provides four ways to make a but they are both selectable options for a reason I don't understand.  I have sent Adobe several messages over the years asking them why this is the case but my requests have been ignored. I have to wonder if the Dreamweaver Site Settings bug is an inside joke.  Maybe it dates back to the original Macromedia development team.  Maybe keeping the ""feature"" was part of the acquisition agreement in 2005.  Whatever the case this humorous bug could be considered a cockroach for its perseverance. If any other web developers have noticed this bug or in the comments below.

Some suggest that sexism explains the reluctance to accept Betsy's achievements but perhaps it is simply a misunderstanding of the process of history. Historians don't have all the answers. They don't have a complete and reliable record of the past. Historians need to interpret the available evidence to construct as accurate a picture of the past as they can and sometimes the available evidence is incomplete and inconclusive. That's very different from a hoax or a myth. and blue of the flag represent? Why are the stars in a circle? The stars were in a circle so that no one colony would be viewed above another. It is reported that George Washington said ""Let the 13 stars in a circle stand as a new constellation in the heavens."" In an affidavit made public in 1870 ""[The committee] showed her [Betsy Ross] a drawing roughly executed of the flag as it was proposed to be made by the committee and that she saw in it some defects in its proportions and the arrangement and shape of the stars. That she said it was square and a flag should be one third longer than its width that the stars were scattered promiscuously over the field and she said they should be either in lines or in some adopted form as a circle and that the stars were six-pointed in the drawing and she said they should be five pointed."" Why would Betsy Ross be chosen to make the flag? It was usual in that day for upholsterers to be flagmakers. As Betsy Ross prayed in the pew next to George Washington and had already sewn buttons for him and she was a niece of George Ross it is not exceptional that these members of the Flag Committee formed by the Continental Congress would call upon Betsy Ross to make the flag. It is known that Betsy Ross rented rooms here. At the time of the alleged flag creation she was either here at 239 Arch Street or next door at 241 Arch where the garden is now. House numbers on her street between the years 1785 and 1857 were registered using three different numbering systems making the determination very tricky.

Mary Young Pickersgill sewed the very large (30'x42') Star-Spangled Banner in the summer of 1813. It flew over Fort McHenry during the War of 1812 (1812-1814) and was the inspiration for Francis Scott Key to write what would become our National Anthem.

Many people discover among their family relics a certificate from the American Flag House and Betsy Ross Memorial Association. What is it?

1620764482.078507,53388751,https://newpol.org/will-biden-be-another-roosevelt/,"the weekly newspaper of the New Anticapitalist Party (NPA) of France. Perhaps the most frequently discussed question lately is: Will President Joseph Biden be another Franklin D. Roosevelt? FDR’s presidency transformed the United States with its New Deal a collection of social welfare programs that rewrote the nation’s social contract. During the Great Depression of the 1930s FDR created massive jobs programs and most important created Social Security retirement program and passed the National Labor Relations Act giving unions the right to organize. Roosevelt also built the New Deal Coalition made up of labor unions and corporations that produced consumer goods which became the base of the Democratic Party for the next 75 years. with the United States facing another crisis the coronavirus pandemic and the accompanying economic depression will Biden succeed in carrying out a similar transformation? He would not be the first to do so. In the 1960s President Lyndon B. Johnson carried out a similar national reconstruction passing the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts that enfranchised southern Blacks and to help the poor created his War on Poverty his Great Society health and education programs especially Medicare for the elderly and Medicaid for the poor. FDR and LBJ both acted in response to tremendous social pressure. The labor upheaval of the 1930s with waves of strikes that included mass picket lines and confrontations with police and national guard led FDR to take action while LBJ acted under the pressure of the Black civil rights movement with its boycotts Biden faces no pressure from the social movements but instead has had to deal with the unique issue of the coronavirus pandemic. Can progressive social legislation be passed without popular and working-class agitation? What is Biden trying to do? He is trying to get Congress to pass legislation that will cost $6 trillion dollar—paid for by taxing the rich and corporations—and establish many new programs for the economy and the environment. He is motivating his package by arguing that the United States must remain competitive with other nations China above all. That is the progressive domestic policy is motivated by a desire to rebuild America so as to reestablish the global hegemony of American imperialism. only the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan to deal with COVID has passed. Two other plans remain: the $2.3 trillion American Jobs Plan and the $1.8 trillion American Family Plan. With the Senate divided 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans it will be difficult to get these through Congress especially with antiquated rules that usually requires 60 votes to pass a bill. The debate has been framed in terms of a program to rebuild the nation’s infrastructure. The Republicans define infrastructure as roads while Biden and the Democrats argue that things such as childcare and two years free college education must be included. Biden’s plan to deal with climate change by expanding renewable energy sources is opposed by the Republicans and the oil companies but it is also criticized by environmental groups that argue that it is not big enough. Progressive Democrat Alexandria Ocasio Cortez says it should be four times larger. The Democratic Socialists of America backed Senator Bernie Sanders which was also the program of DSA. Perhaps DSA members believe they have been successful in moving the Democrats. We should remember that the same thing happened in the 1930s when FDR pragmatically adopted much of the program of the Socialist Party of America leading that party to dwindle as socialists became Democrats. writer and activist. He is a co-editor of No Joint Struggle With Settler Colonialism right? Isn’t that worth a few bucks -maybe more?  Please timely analysis unswerving in its commitment to struggles for peace has called “socialism” for a half-century. Dan says “Perhaps DSA members believe they have been successful in moving the Democrats.” I haven’t encountered any who believe this. Mostly DSA members I know are still critiquing Biden from the left — in part on the grounds that Dan discusses here. I’m curious which DSA members Dan has talked to that make him wonder if they think that DSA are responsible for making Biden — or even the Dems as a whole — move to the left. And Biden hasn’t adopted Sanders’ program. I haven’t seen Biden pushing for single-payer health care striking down the Hyde Amendment for abortion enfranchising ex-cons as well as people currently in prison a Green New Deal (same as what AOC demands) free child care and pre-K for all…I could go on.

1620764487.088495,5016215,https://www.historic-uk.com/AboutHistoricUK/,Hello and welcome to Historic UK! PR manager for Historic UK and I’ve been asked to provide a short overview of who we are what we do and – most importantly – why you should use our unique website. With that in mind l’ll start back at the beginning where all good stories start… Cue the whirring of dial-up modems Microsoft Frontpage and an exceptionally slow PC. It’s 2000 and the first version of Historic UK is uploaded to the internet the first website of its kind dedicated to the history and heritage of Britain. But this wasn’t just any old history website… Historic UK’s vision was to bring history to life and to do so it needed to be two websites in one. The first section of the website was called the designed to stir the imagination and allow history lovers to stay in some of the most historic buildings in the country. The second section of the website was the a monthly online publication featuring all of those weird gruesome and interesting bits of history that were often left out of the school curriculum. From we like to think of our articles as a ‘Horrible Histories for Adults’! Starting as a team of two it was soon obvious that the scale and scope of the website required some extra manpower and the company slowly grew to a team of a six with guest authors from around the globe. Fast forward to 2009 and it was decided that for Historic UK’s 10th anniversary that it would be getting a nifty little redesign. Introducing a brand new search engine for our Accommodation Guide and the ability to filter our history articles by type the first ‘new look’ site went live in 2010. as the technology moved with the times so did we… we noticed that more and more of our readers were starting to access the Historic UK website from their mobile phones and other mobile devices. Recognising that our site needed to look just as good on all forms of media we launched our second ‘new look’ site in 2017. Above: Last year’s Historic UK Christmas party. Our research team and magazine authors With more than one million page views each month we believe that we are now the largest on-line history magazine in the UK. We fully recognise however that size is not everything and we pride ourselves on the historical accuracy of our articles. That said as history may change as new evidence is found and interpreted so our articles are amended to reflect this. Our researchers and magazine authors are obviously a bunch of ‘very sad history nerds’ collected from very diverse backgrounds. gathered from a cross-section of universities around the UK and further afield in order to ensure a balanced presentation of the facts. Our research team includes supervisory experience to MPhil and PhD levels and many of our authors are active history teachers all ruled by the ‘Iron Fist’ of Mrs Ed(itor) aka Deborah who has the last say in what is published and what is not.

1620764492.034626,53008418,https://pc.net/news/2020-05-15/netgear_rax200_router_review,"The Netgear RAX200 router is among the most elite routers available for home .  It has the latest 6 technology for wireless connections and five ports for wired devices.  It is configurable using a web interface and you can manage it with a mobile app.  On top of all that But does it live up to the hype? Looks aren't everything when it comes to computer equipment but I would argue that solid design adds value to any device that sits in plain view all day.  The RAX200's sleek aesthetic appears to receive inspiration from the recent Star Wars trilogy.  It looks like it might just take off and fly away.  Fortunately in the 30 days I used the it remained firmly planted on my desk.  The stark black design is not for everyone or every space The most notable spec in the RAX200's long list of accolades is Wi-Fi 6 support. The latest Wi-Fi 6 technology (also known as 802.11ax) can provide speeds up to 4x faster than 802.11ac.  It also has three bands (two 5 GHz and one 2.4 GHz) with four streams each for a total of 12 separate wireless streams.  Theoretically this is great if you have lots of devices connecting to the router at one time. ▶ The ""AX11000"" label on the router is misleading to put it nicely.  It combines a maximum speed of 4800 Mbps for both 5 GHz connections and a maximum speed of 1200 Mbps for the 2.4 GHz connection 800 Mbps.  First of all that is less than 11 wireless devices are unlikely to reach speeds even close to the 4800 Mbps max.  And thirdly if multiple devices are connected and max out the bandwidth there will be so much interference the speed will decrease even further. or even close.  But did I get blazing fast wireless speeds with the RAX200?  No. Not only were my speeds disappointing they were often slower than the seven-year-old Apple router the RAX200 replaced.  I tested my new iPhone SE (which supports Wi-Fi 6) next to my old iPhone 7 both about two feet away from the router.  The results were shockingly bad.  In the photo below my iPhone 7 is on the left and the iPhone SE is on the right. 17.5 Mbps downstream is horrible for a 1 Gbps Internet connection and 6.6 Mbps upstream is a joke.  Fortunately after restarting the router a few times and trying different locations I was able to get wireless speeds above 400 Mbps.  But in most tests Inconsistent wireless speeds plagued me for the entire month I used the RAX200.  Sometimes the wireless connection would drop altogether.  And several devices that should have easily been in range of one of the 5 GHz bands connected at 2.4 GHz using the ""Smart Connect"" feature.  So that reduced the potential wireless speeds right off the bat.  I expected much more from a new top-of-the-line Netgear router. The RAX200 has four Gigabit Ethernet ports and one 2.5 Gbps port.  I connected the 2.5 Gbps port to my iMac Pro using a Cat 6a Ethernet cable.  Immediately I got the same 940 Mbps download speed and 40 Mbps speed I had been getting with my Comcast rental device.  But I wanted more — I was hoping for Multi-Gig Internet speeds over 1 Gbps. One of the reasons I bought the RAX200 was so I could achieve download speeds over 1 Gbps.  Using the web interface I activated Ethernet port aggregation on my Netgear CM1150V modem and on the RAX200.  It was a somewhat complicated view the Help Article about how to set up Multi-Gig Internet After activating Ethernet port aggregation and connecting the router and modem with two Ethernet cables I tested my Internet speed again.  I leaped for joy when I saw download speeds over 1 000 Mbps for the first time.  The fastest tests came in at just over 1 But my enthusiasm was short-lived.  The next day I noticed Netflix was loading slowly on my TV websites were sluggish on my phone and webpages even loaded slowly on my iMac Pro.  I ran another speed test and got this. The download speed dropped to less than 1/50 of the day before.  I restarted the router and my speeds were back above 1 100 Mbps.  But the next day same thing.  The download speed was under 20 Mbps.  This kept happening so I contacted Netgear support via email and they had me make several changes to the router settings.  The changes didn't help.  I had multiple phone calls with Netgear support including one two-hour phone call where they had me run about 20 speed tests and offered no solution other than to downgrade the firmware.  I finally tried that and my maximum wired speed declined to 480 Mbps.  Two days later it was back under 20 Mbps. I thought maybe I got a defective unit but after reading the Netgear forums it turns there are many other RAX200 users with similar issues.  Most users have the CM1200 modem so the problem is with the router and not the modem.  When downgrading the firmware did not fix the issue that was the end.  Time for a different router. Weak 5 GHz signal on both bands The Netgear RAX200 is a promising router with all the latest technology you could want.  The mobile app provides simple control of the router and connected devices.  Unfortunately it is horribly unreliable and does not provide speeds even close to the advertised maximum.  There have to be better options for $500.

Bridging Academia And Industry Through Project Based Experiential Learning Organizations are looking to millennial and academia for innovative solutions and knowledge to address business challenges in this volatile complex and ambiguous (VUCA) environment. Conversely academia and students need to be attuned to the various challenges and realities of industry to stay relevant. Singapore Management University (SMU) bridges these gaps between academia and industry by introducing SMU-X – an experiential learning programme where students faculty and industry partners come together to devise solutions and provide perspectives to business social and emerging challenges through real-world projects faced by the industry. The Generation Y students who come into the pharmacy course are technology-savvy and digitally-focused. We identified their gaming habits and preferences for a pharmacy-related serious game. In general post-apocalyptic game with a fantasy/medieval/mythic setting and an adventurer storyline played in a collaborative manner. Thus we developed a three-dimensional Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game in which students engage in a futuristic fantasy world to “save the world” from a plague so as to learn about the 21st century competencies and skills (confidence self-directed learner) needed in their future clinical practices. AI-powered educational software is increasingly being used in K-12 classrooms. Such software allows students to work at their own pace while freeing up the teacher to spend more time working one-on-one with students who need it most. Yet orchestrating personalized learning can be challenging for teachers as each student in the class may be working on a different activity at any given time. Working with K-12 teachers we are co-designing Lumilo: a pair of smartglasses that enable teachers to more effectively personalize instruction while keeping their heads up and their eyes focused on the classroom. Green School exists to enable students to connect with nature and with communities to develop holistically with skills and competencies for the world of today and the future to learn entrepreneurial approaches to problem solving and to make a real difference now. Our sustainability initiatives and entrepreneurial programs form part of an innovative skills-based educational model. GS delivers authentic inspiring young leaders to be responsible global citizenship through a replicable real-world case study with immense growth potential. GS is a sustainable and shareable model of learning that has captured the hearts and minds of millions worldwide. Apps for Good is a charity aiming to grow a global generation of problem-solvers and tech entrepreneurs; young people that learn how to build market and launch digital tools to solve real-world problems positively impacting their communities and challenging the status quo. Partnering with schools and colleges across the world Apps for Good trains educators to deliver our online product development programme to students aged 10 – 18 from a diverse range of socio-economic transforming the way technology is taught in schools and helping young people learn to turn bright ideas into real technology products. International and national assessments show that too many U.S. students struggle with understanding nonfiction text. In a competitive global economy ignoring the root causes of the problem and simply “watering down” content for students who struggle just widens the achievement gap and is a great disservice to these students. Readorium’s mission is to help all students become confident and motivated readers who are passionate about science. Readorium’s online programs meet this challenge by teaching 3rd-8th grade students transferable strategies and word-learning skills needed to comprehend all nonfiction and by providing text and supports that automatically adapt to their needs. Green School’s Operation Rain or Shine (OROS) represents integrated and purposeful learning at its best. Encouraging responsible global citizenship and learning around sustainability – for Green School and the surrounding community students develop holistically with skills and competencies critical for the world of today and tomorrow. Applying systems thinking OROS aims to be a showcase to the world of renewable energy and student Green Leadership. An inspiring example of how through entrepreneurial problem solving children can make a real difference in the world now. Stu Brew is Europe’s first ever microbrewery to be managed by and for students with the sales profits being invested back into training and development for students and overall long-term sustainability of the enterprise. The brewery was set up as a Student Community Action Newcastle (SCAN) scheme which has been supported to establish sustainability projects as a part of the National Union of Students (NUS) Student Green Fund. Reflecting the strong focus on student entrepreneurship at Newcastle Stu Brew is run as a social enterprise to support student development and help improve their employability skills. The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) is committed to foster sustainable development through education and research. Service-Learning(SL) combines formal academic study and community service to enhance students’ sustainable learning and social responsibility. Since 2013 a 3-credit Service-Learning subject entitled “Promotion of Children and Adolescent Development” has been offered to 981 PolyU students from different disciplines. Through this subject students have served more than 3 000 migrant children in mainland China(Video 1 and 2) and 6 400 secondary school students in Hong Kong. Evaluation findings suggest that the subject significantly contributes to sustainable development of university students their service targets and the communities. GREEN SCHOOL BIO BUS SOCIAL ENTERPRISE the graduating class of Green School (GS) conceived the idea of a “Bio Bus” as their legacy service project. In less than a year Bio Bus evolved from a student-brainstorming project into a social enterprise empowering students to take action on solving environmental problems. Bio Bus addresses transportation and waste problems in Bali through education and community mobilisation. It’s mission to provide sustainable transport services to GS students and staff engage with the broader community by offering solutions to health and waste problems around used cooking oil (UCO) integrated learning to the youth. Next Tech Lab is a leading student-run cross-disciplinary research lab in India. The lab was founded by students who spent a semester at MIT Cambridge on a scholarship. They were intrigued by the anti-disciplinary research culture of the MIT Media Lab where they interned. While Next Tech doesn’t just ape the Media Lab framework like in Richard Feynman’s anecdotes about “Cargo-Cult Science” its policies are built to foster innovation and disruptive thinking. Researchers work on Deep Learning Blockchains/Decentralization & Internet of Things. The lab has advisors from MIT Cambridge University and silicon-valley start-ups. GameLab is a web platform of Business and Management Simulators. A business laboratory were students must take an active role in their learning and the teacher one of facilitator. Thus the attention of the participants is 100% centered in the experience of learning failing and succeeding. We are making the most out of the gamification trend in order to revolutionize business and management schools providing experiences and real scenarios were students can make and try their decisions. GameLab will become the new standard approach for business teaching. Simulators are the XXIst century evolution of the business cases. Our unique methodology consists of 3 steps in one academic year: 1. IDEA: children from elementary/kindergarten schools invent their own ‘Dream Machine’. Anything goes. The main criterion is that it’s relevant for the child who really really wants it. 2. CONCEPT: higher education students (e.g. product design art students) propose one or more solutions to design those machines. 3. WORKING PROTOTYPE: technical secondary Schools pupils build real working prototypes of those machines. Throughout this whole process all students collaborate as peers and can use the expertise and support of a wide range of organisations. The goal is to improve the teaching-learning process of mathematics by increasing spatial visualization skills using augmented reality virtual environments and 3D impressions. A new way of teaching important mathematical concepts is presented by adding the senses of touch and sight to the learning process showing the student a way of describing reality through mathematical language in a natural way and achieving a meaningful learning of mathematics. The results indicate an increase in motivation and increased learning in addition to developing skills of mathematical visualization and interpretation of concepts in students. The focus of the submission is the University of Exeter’s substantial investment and long-term commitment to the concept of delivering a progressive Employability and Professional Pathway (EPP) programmes for all its students throughout their time at Exeter and provide solid foundation to build their professional careers beyond graduation. Its success however would not be possible without the influence and impact of other key elements of the employability ecosystem and is an aspect of its strategic inclusion is also a significant innovation. The overarching strategic context is provided within this section.

The WOW room is IE’s solution for remote synchronous teaching in a collaborative and engaging fashion. It includes an immersive hardware installation (similar to a recording studio with a 3x15m U-shaped video-wall) and a software. Thanks to the WOW room up to 60 students at once can connect and participate live (with audio and video) in a discussion which the professor can facilitate seeing all the students at once and being able to walk around – like in a physical classroom. Students can also engage through polls or videos and can work in groups in the breakout rooms. INSEAD BUSINESS SCHOOL & ESMT BERLIN The Negotiations Course for the World is completely open source and free and specifically tailored for instructors in emerging markets. This course in a box includes lecture slides and teaching notes. Materials are translated into hundreds of languages including underserved local languages so high-quality education can reach the corners of the world that need this most. Course materials are further customised to local settings to provide a global non US-centric education experience. This is the first in a series of courses to create business education for those who need it most. Trinity College Dublin has embarked on a renewal of its undergraduate programmes through the Trinity Education Project (TEP). The official impetus was a recognition that the curriculum must continue to evolve in the light of advances in disciplinary knowledge and that the context in which graduates participate is rapidly changing. The Trinity Assessment Framework is a core element of TEP and is an ambitious institutional pedagogical reform initiative. By reimagining our approaches to assessment this framework aims to deepen students’ learning and thus support the complexity of learning needed for the 21st Century graduate. Mindprint bridges the gap between neurocognitive assessment and classroom achievement with a low-cost evidence-based solution for all students. Mindprint identifies the root cause of learning struggles using an online screener of executive functions reasoning and speed. The battery is group administered in one class period . Results are used to automatically generate personalized learning plans for every student in math and study skills that include the most effective evidence-based strategies based on that student’s unique strengths and needs. Integrating cognitive data with traditional achievement data enables teachers to best meet every learner’s needs. Instructional time is precious. Learners are inundated with assessments that crowd out instructional time. Carnegie Learning’s MATHia intelligent tutors already understand what students know through their work on real-world so why ask students to sit for anxiety-provoking tests of low-level skills? The Every Student Succeeds Act enables us to reimagine high-stakes assessments replacing them with competency-based mastery. Embedding assessment into the learning process and monitoring progress with our Adaptive Personalized Learning Score (APLSE) supports personalized learning without taking away instructional time. This project further refines and tests APLSE driving development of a replacement for high-stakes and formative assessments. The Open Learning Initiative (OLI) is a non-profit research organization at Carnegie Mellon University. OLI offers openly licensed adaptive online courses that can be used by instructors or independent learners. OLI offers an exemplar of CMU’s learning engineering approach integrating learning science with the design of innovative and using the data from these activities to improve instruction while advancing our understanding of human learning. The result: courseware that that combines instructional material continuous feedback and evidence-based research improving outcomes while lowering costs. Numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of OLI’s work showing improved learning in reduced time. KHALIFA UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY & ARISTOTLE UNIVERSITY OF THESSALONIKI A/B/C-TEACH explores the ways effective teaching is enhanced by when bridging the fields of affective(a)- blended(b)- and collaborative(c)-learning into a hybrid enhanced instructional environment. Progressing from a Pilot implementation through to a large-scale one (5000 LMS users 300 b-learning courses in 6 academic years) A/B/C/-TEACH already proposes a unique architecture/methodology which incorporates hybrid and innovative processing techniques of fuzzy-set theory and affective computing. New guidelines about the enhancement of LMS-based teaching/learning processes will finally be delivered contributing to the enrichment of the HEI services and re-examination of educational policies/practices. Founded in 2009 by Justice Sandra Day O’Connor iCivics is reinventing civic education through edu-gaming. Through our games young people learn how our government works and why it works. They allow students to experience civics directly. Teachers are quickly signing up with iCivics: they have access to high-quality and non-partisan materials. We are raising student achievement through inventive and impactful ideas. developed in 2011 by Professor Kolb is an assessment tool that K-12 educators use to measure how effectively a lesson integrates technology to positively impact student learning goals. The Triple E Framework is informed by decades of valid research which provided guidelines on effective and ineffective practices for technology tools to elicit learning growth in students. The TripleEPLN developed in 2017 is a social networking tool supporting K-12 educators to evaluate their lesson plans with the Triple E Framework and collaborate with other teachers on designing lessons to integrate technology informed by research. approximately 2.5 million students are admitted to college in the US. By September approximately fourteen percent of those — 350 000 students — who intend to enroll fail to matriculate. Students who “melt” over the summer or dropout disproportionately come from underserved communities which frequently lack the supportive resources to help students navigate challenging financial and social situations. AdmitHub’s AI chatbots help colleges scale personalized text-based advising with a vast audience. Through a series of automated reminders and tutorials these virtual advisors guide each student on a personalized path to successfully enrolling in college. Deakin Genie is a transformational agent for student service learning support and success.

At Lab4U we are democratizing science and changing the way science is taught with a Lab in your pocket by transforming mobile devices into scientific instruments to improve the experience of science education. Imagine if students could gain relevant real-world experience in their field of study without having to leave campus. Agriculture students at University of Illinois are collaborating with Unilever to chart a path towards growing nutritious food at scale. Management students at University of Delaware are teaming up with eBay to devise service models for the future of eCommerce. Environmental science students at Vanderbilt are advising the Cradle to Cradle Products Innovation Institute on how to position green product labels in retail environments. All of this is happening today through ImpactEd the bridge that connects the classroom to the real world. The proposed Open Innovation Laboratory has three major pillars: specific Learning Techniques to enhance education; Design Methodologies to guide the design process and a Rapid Product Realization Platform that includes emergent technologies for product development. Using this Open Innovation Laboratory it is possible to demonstrate students apply technical skills and experiences during the development of innovative and sustainable products. The laboratory promotes interactive collaboration between internal and external actors during the innovation process to develop Sensing and Sustainable products and services. It also supports the maker movement to stimulate an entrepreneurship culture and foster companies incubation and economic development. The Bilingual Education hybrid course project aims to train teachers in the bilingual perspective (Brazilian Sign Language/Portuguese Language) considering linguistic and cultural particularities of deaf people. Course implementation will be in 13 universities spread all over Brazil training 390 bilingual teachers per year. Developing the first virtual environment totally in sign language and innovative methodology to bilingual teaching materials construction we intend to include deaf community in Brazil’s teaching systems. Moreover we make the commitment of developing a digital database to preserve and disseminate several educational materials related to deafness. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA DARDEN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS Giving Voice to Values (GVV) is an innovative approach to values-driven leadership pioneered by Dr. Mary Gentile. GVV is based at the University of Virginia Darden School of Business having been launched by Aspen Institute with Yale School of Management then supported at Babson College 2009-2016. Drawing on actual experience and scholarship GVV fills a long-standing critical gap in the development of values-centered leaders. Rather than focusing on ethical analysis GVV focuses on ethical implementation asking the questions: “What if I were going to act on my values? What would I say and do? How could I be most effective?” To promote ethical leadership and holistic development in university students a subject entitled “Tomorrow’s Leaders” has been developed and implemented at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University for all undergraduates since 2012/13. The subject aims to enable students to learn concepts and theories about essential qualities of ethical leaders to reflect on their development in both intrapersonal and interpersonal domains and to apply evidence-based pedagogies to cultivate their morality integrity and leadership qualities. A variety of teaching approaches have been adopted to facilitate students’ learning and reflection. The findings of different evaluative methods converged to support the impact of the subject. ALU was founded in 2015 with the mission to educate 3 million leaders for the African continent and the world by 2060. Through a unique and innovative learning model leveraging peer-to-peer learning real world project-based learning and a focus on leadership and skills development ALU has created a reinvented learning experience that is relevant to today’s fast changing world. With ~300 students from 40 nationalities at its Flagship campus in Mauritius ALU just opened its 2nd campus in Rwanda and aspires to build 25 campuses across Africa and beyond in the next 2 decades. InferCabulary is a digital vocabulary learning application for students and learning specialists based around a new form of vocabulary instruction called Semantic Reasoning.

SPEAKall! and SPEAKmore! enable early language learning and expand social circles as students learn. These solutions grow with the learner enabling better participation in school and community thus reducing the lifetime cost of care while enhancing chances for classroom success. codeSpark Academy with The Foos is the only resource for kids 4-9 that combines curriculum backed exercises and puzzles with powerful creative tools. A word-free interface makes the game accessible to kids in all countries. So far over 20 million in 219 countries have played. The app includes: – Puzzles that teach children key computer science concepts such as sequencing conditionals and variables. – Game Kits where kids learn to code seriously cool games with paint-by-numbers tutorials. – Minigames that teach concepts related to computer science like boolean logic MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY & DOT LEARN Education is poor in the place where it is needed most – developing countries. This is largely an infrastructural and funding problem. Building new schools and training teachers to deliver high-quality education is beyond the means of most private individuals or public institutions. When it is available it is not within the financial means of parents. However the gains of new forms of learning such as online education cannot reach most users in places like Africa because of hardware and internet connection issues. We solve this problem by figuring out a way to encode videos in 1/100th of the file-size. Problem-based learning (PBL) is an important educational strategy adopted and contextualized in many medical colleges. A problem is usually presented to students in paper form or in a digital format. This format of delivery lacks the authenticity of a patient encounter. The Project Virtual patient learning (VPL) is an online simulation system based on artificial intelligence and pre-recorded movies in which the learner plays the role of a physician who confronts a (simulated) patient. The interaction takes place in real time and each decision taken by the learner instantly affects the reactions of the patient just as it would in real life. The patient in the scenario is played by a professional actor who is trained to simulate variable moods and emotional responses through verbal and non-verbal communication (body language and tone of voice). Feedback is given through the simulated patient’s comments. Virtual patient learning can be used in two modes: a ‘learning’ mode and an ‘evaluation’ mode. VPL has been used on a trial basis in Qatar and France. Outcomes We believe that VPL will gradually replace the traditional less authentic forms of PBL. Edify Technologies’ mission is to give every child in the world a chance to make their own music. The goal of this project is to produce software that makes it easy for people with special needs especially those on the autism spectrum to compose their own music. People with disabilities ought to be able to easily interact with an accessible touch interface to write their own music and interactive music lessons can help promote self expression and socio-emotional intelligence by guiding users to write happy Story Shares is a literacy hub dedicated to struggling readers in middle school and beyond. If a 13-year-old reads on a first grade level she shouldn’t have to practice reading with books like Curious George. But the books written for her age group are too challenging. At Story Shares we are building a new collection of books specifically created to be both compelling and approachable for the millions of teens and young adults who lack literacy skills. Through writing contests we crowd source these Relevant Reads: providing writers with incentives and tools to publish books for this overlooked audience. Inanimate Alice is a work of electronic literature a digital text that uses game-like backdrops and techniques to engage students in reading and stimulate their creativity. Uniquely it is a work of progressive complexity that mirrors the protagonist’s age and the skills she has acquired in pursuing her dream of one day becoming a game designer. It is a tale of the ups and downs of life of eventual success against all odds. Twelve years in production and still incomplete Inanimate Alice provides a compelling narrative thread for K20 education and academic research the world over. HELM Open is a collection of over 250 free multimedia learning resources. Many of these have been developed by patients meaning that they provide unique insights for healthcare students and others around the world on subjects as diverse as dementia end of life care and childhood development. The team has developed a distinctive process and tools to empower communities in resource creation. The resources are having a global impact and are currently being accessed by approximately 1.5 million users in over 50 countries. Research and evaluation shows clear impact for these learners. VICTORIA UNIVERSITY OF WELLINGTON: VIRTUAL REALITY EXPERIENTIAL EDUCATION The project is driven by the need for the wicked and pressing challenges of sustainability and the solutions to be more ‘meaningful’ and ‘accessible’ in education. While also in education we need to ‘leave no one behind’ (Sustainable Development Goals) current teaching methods generally lack the crucial social and cultural context and prioritise auditory and reading/writing learning styles. In response this project embraced situated experiential education and virtual reality technology to both immerse learners in a meaningful case study and to cater to visual and kinesthetic learning styles. The project takes hundreds of students annually to Fiji and Peru. Only 16% of Australian doctoral students with academic career intentions report having participated in any teaching development during their candidature leaving them underprepared for academic life. To improve employability QUT developed and implemented Teaching Advantage Global (TA): a competency-based teaching development program that engages doctoral students in a community of inquiry with peers and experts across disciplines and institutions underpinned by a cognitive apprenticeship framework.

Problem-based learning (PBL) is an important educational strategy adopted and contextualized in many medical colleges. A problem is usually presented to students in paper form or in a digital format. This format of delivery lacks the authenticity of a patient encounter. The Project Virtual patient learning (VPL) is an online simulation system based on artificial intelligence and pre-recorded movies in which the learner plays the role of a physician who confronts a (simulated) patient. The interaction takes place in real time and each decision taken by the learner instantly affects the reactions of the patient just as it would in real life. The patient in the scenario is played by a professional actor who is trained to simulate variable moods and emotional responses through verbal and non-verbal communication (body language and tone of voice). Feedback is given through the simulated patient’s comments. Virtual patient learning can be used in two modes: a ‘learning’ mode and an ‘evaluation’ mode. VPL has been used on a trial basis in Qatar and France. Outcomes We believe that VPL will gradually replace the traditional less authentic forms of PBL.

A SELF-GUIDED VIRTUAL REALITY TRAINING PLATFORM FOR TEACHING TEMPORAL BONE SURGERY reduced opportunities for operating room practice and scarcity of resources have resulted in the emergence of supplemental surgical training environments such as virtual reality (VR). VR-based surgical training is advantageous because it supports structured a major setback to its widespread adoption is the lack of automated feedback/guidance which requires the presence of human experts to provide advice during training. To overcome this Melbourne developed methods of providing automated feedback/guidance on different aspects of surgical skills in a VR simulator and validated their effectiveness in teaching temporal bone surgery. COLLABORATIONS IN LEARNING – THE QUT PEER PROGRAMS STRATEGY The Peer Programs Strategy is a university-wide evidence-based support framework for peer programs at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in Australia. The Strategy has been used to align peer programs across QUT with a set of common principles: using a partnership approach aligning peer support into curriculum developing a distributed leadership model and building leadership capabilities among both staff and students for peer-enabled initiatives. In particular the Strategy has successfully redesigned peer programs to make them more needs driven learner-centred and accessible to non-traditional students thus providing sustainable structures that will provide ongoing support of these vulnerable populations. In 2014 The Mind Lab launched a hybrid postgraduate programme to reskill New Zealand teachers in digital technologies and contemporary educational practice. The 32-week programme was built upon a commitment to easy access (both geographic and digital literacy) recognising that many New Zealand teachers taught in small towns where the majority had low levels of digital and technological confidence. Since then the Digital and Collaborative learning programme has become the largest and most distributed postgraduate programme in New Zealand’s history. Over 4000 teachers have undertaken this blended delivery course in 85 towns and regions. Business-based approaches hold tremendous power to alleviate poverty. Yet there is very little real understanding of how business-related skills and know-how can take on this challenge and a dearth of good educational models for developing the capacity to do so. The Subsistence Marketplace Initiative (SMI) at its core addresses this educational need. Our curricular innovations challenge students to confront global problems and envision a better world adopting a conception of business that focuses on finding win-wins between different dimensions of sustainability while acknowledging tradeoffs and emphasizing a pragmatic focus on sustainability.

UQ BEL STUDENT EMPLOYABILITY TEAM: GETTING STUDENTS SET FOR THEIR FUTURE With the introduction of the demand-driven system University enrolments have dramatically increased. At the same time graduate employment rates have been declining. UQ’s Business Economics and Law (BEL) Faculty discovered that students believed a bachelor’s degree would result in employment. This is problematic because it does not acknowledge that employers require more. The BEL Faculty recognized a need to provide a real solution for its students. The Faculty addressed this problem by implementing a faculty embedded Student Employability Team (SET). Through its innovative employability services the SET strategy supports thousands of students resulting in graduate employment rates well-above national averages.

APPLYING AN INSTRUCTOR’S POINT OF VIEW FILMING (IPOV) FOR A FLIPPED PRE-LABORATORY The usual way in which laboratory instructional videos are filmed takes the third person view. However such videos are not as realistic and sensorial. A more personal and effective way of educating students on laboratory procedures has been pioneered – the Instructor’s Point of View (IPOV) technique. To capture the attention of technology-savvy students in the 21st century educators have to be innovative and reinvent new ways to teach procedures in conducting chemistry experiments. This 3-year study made use of GoPro/Google Glass to film realistic IPOV videos (Live and pre-lab) from the demonstrator’s point of view. written and researched by experienced and outstanding teachers to sound pedagogical principles. They seek to combat wasteful development and duplication of lesson resources across the UK. Their editable presentations homework and end of unit assessments free teachers up to teach feed back and focus on the individual needs of their students. Schools using these resources have been shown to improve the grades of their students. Have you ever asked “do you have any questions or comments” to your students in class?

The New Zealand Minister of Education announced the intention to adopt ‘digital technologies’ as a new priority area in education adding to literacy and numeracy. The announcement in May 2017 required teachers from K1- K10 to comprehend a new curriculum area that was unfamiliar and technical. The two priority focus areas were identified as ‘Computational Thinking’ and ‘Designing & Developing Digital Outcomes’. Through our long-term relationship with teachers across the country it was identified that teachers felt a high level of anxiety about truly understanding the curriculum and how to bring it to life in classrooms teaching students aged 5 – 15 years. The Mind Lab identified the need for a non-intimidating comprehensive resource that could be undertaken in their own time that could be self-paced and linked to year levels education outcomes and the new curriculum. An online video-based platform was determined to be the most accessible and useful resource. It was also decided that the resource would need to be free for teachers to remove any financial barrier from accessing new knowledge and key information. The solution developed is a video-based online platform that is designed to be highly accessible (non-tech language) informative and relevant. The solution is broken into four curriculum levels and focus areas linked to year levels. Each area of focus is supported by examples suggested resources and downloadable content. The resource is made free to all New Zealand teachers through a personalized school code. Parents and other interested people can access the platform for a small fee of $39.95NZD. The ability to provide the $300 000 resource to teachers at no charge was funded by the two shareholders in The Mind Lab and the generous support of a local philanthropic trust – NEXT Foundation. MATH SHELF – EARLY MATH MASTERY Low-income preschoolers begin Kindergarten one year behind their middle and high-income peers in mathematics and these achievement differences grow to 2.5 years by the end of fifth grade. Early math interventions can eliminate the school entry math achievement gap fewer than 1 in 4 US children who attend public preschools receive high-quality math instruction. Public preschools spend less instructional time on math compared to private preschools and children participate in fewer math activities than students in private preschools. Moreover qualitative studies have documented that teachers in low-income preschools use little mathematics language and survey data demonstrate preK teachers don’t feel prepared to teach math. Cost effective and scalable early mathematics interventions for low-income preschoolers are needed to improve their math outcomes and future academic achievement. We created Math Shelf a tablet early math program with the goal to eliminate the school entry math achievement gap. Math Shelf uses tablets to integrate the mathematics instructional materials and sequence created by Maria Montessori and mathematics content from evidenced-based early interventions. Math Shelf is both adaptive and scalable. Using algorithms Math Shelf adapts the math materials and sequence to individual student’s achievement levels. This adaptability optimizes both learning and engagement because children play math games that are neither to easy nor too hard. Math Shelf is scalable and affordable. It runs on $49 Amazon Fire tablets thus enabling play in school and home environments. Finally Math Shelf solves for the problem of mathematics NOT being consistently taught in low-income preschools because it provides an easy to implement tool for preschool teachers to provide children with opportunities to learn early mathematics skills.

Executive Doctorate of Business Administration students face many challenges when either legitimizing an expertise for an industry or transitioning into academia. Doctoral supervisors must adapt their scientific guidance to this specific population. Superwisor is a serious game played by doctoral supervisors and aims to improve the multifaceted supervisor-supervisee relationship to enhance students’ success in a program to reach their goals. Superwisor facilitates three levels: the initial meeting and publishing. Throughout the game supervisors are prompted to make decisions and at each level’s end supervisors receive personalized feedback and access to resources to improve their practices. still dependent on traditional methods of indoctrination and ‘spoon feeding’ is unilateral (one-sided learning) from employing different teaching tools to delivering the disciplinary content. Unfortunately schools have been shielding overly orchestrated and extremely controlled students and teachers. Ahmed was intellectually reaching out to the swirling leaves to perceive with his hands ignoring his teacher’s artistic illustration of a green leaf on the whiteboard to transmit information on photosynthesis. Well why is he constrained to visually and palpably explore the phenomenon while it is possible to? This scenario tends to nurture a potentially curious child into a passive and sedentary recipient. If the world is not separated to educational or non-educational the child wants to learn everything. They make learning as an integral and organic part of their learning. Instructor centered teaching promotes rote learning – thereby nullifying curiosity in students leading to a decline in problem –solving and critical thinking skills. Creativity nurtured through hands on experience along with curiosity critical thinking and problem solving are among the key techniques that could change this landscape promising a better tomorrow of employability for the next generation. Science is a process of exploration and innovation that roots from the basic inquiry and stems through application to evaluation. Scientific inquiry is an efficient tool to vitalize curiosity. Hence we employ scientific workshops in our STEM pedagogy. The structure of our program is designed as follows; 1- STIMULATING CURIOSITY: We make a show to flare up curiosity through a scientific experiment. 2- ASK: Students pop up quality questions; ‘why’ ‘what if’ and ‘how’ and research and hunt to note their findings. 3- HANDS ON EXPERIENCE: They perform technical experiments to gain an advantage in scientific knowledge. 4 – MOCK DESIGN PROJECT: Apply their acquired knowledge by employing in an already designed project to verse them on the steps to an independently design a project. 5- INSPIRE: convert the acquired knowledge into a real-life application (an independent design project) and it follows the order; A: brainstorm on a real-life problem D: creation (real-working prototypes) and 6- EVALUATION: these working prototypes are presented to community leaders thereby subjecting the students in the real world realizations. This whole process has succeeded in embedding curiosity in each student resulting in an upgraded logical performance. Mathigon is an online platform for middle and high school mathematics.

This scholarship is intended towards any post-secondary career goals after an Apprentice graduates high school. Most education systems do not provide sufficient opportunities to unlock the true potential of the students and retain creative confidence address fear of failure and nurture the ability to think out of the box. It is estimated that 65% of kids entering primary schools today will end up in jobs that don’t exist today. For the next generation of learners it is essential to master empathy critical thinking and creativity in order to be able to work in the complementary way with machines and artificial intelligence. We want to ensure kids embrace empathy design and innovation at a very young age as these will help them stay relevant and make them future-ready. We designed an experiential based curriculum by bringing entrepreneurship design thinking and deliver it in a project based approach where K12 students will solve real world challenges by leveraging IoT sensors (LittleBits) and other emerging technologies. We mapped 40+ life skills and 45+ tools & techniques that are taught in an experiential manner to children and young adults while solving real world challenges. We are also planning to leverage emerging technologies ( such as voice assisted and digital games) to reinforce the skills and tools learnt during the classes. The Biodesign Challenge is an international university competition that pairs art and design students with scientists to envision the future of biotechnology and how it might address grand challenges in health participating universities present their projects and compete for awards on stage at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. The goal of BDC is to seed a new generation of professionals who can integrate design and biotechnology; build an interdisciplinary STEAM community; and engage the larger public about the societal implications of emerging biotech. Two hindrances to students’ international mobility are the need to verify of academic credentials (graduation degree European diploma supplements) by host universities and the centralized recording by the home university of the credits acquired abroad. The Universities of Milano–Bicocca and of Padova together with the CINECA Consortium Computing Center solved problem 1 by devising an “Integrated Graduation OpenBadge” based on Blockcerts and Mozilla OpenBadge technology; for solving problem 2 we are planning a blockchain-based track of records that will allow decentralized direct recording of credits in the students’ careers by foreign host universities. PwC’s vision is to build trust in society. Trust is crucial for people to exchange value especially in this digital age when trust is often violated. Smart Credentials is based on trust and powered by blockchain which leads to an immutable and tamperproof platform. The idea was conceptualised from conversations with our clients & employees who want to independently own and control a verified record of their lifelong achievements. They want portability & freedom to carry share & revoke their credentials. Smart Credentials combines the two crucial ingredients of trust; authentication & authorisation with credentials being issued in permanence. With 21% of all resumes containing a fraudulent degree we think it’s essential to make verification easy decentralized and almost impossible to fake. The problem of our time is fake news and whilst normally we think of that in the news/political sense increased globalization and advances in AI will mean it’s an increasing problem across a range of industries. We expect credential fraud to keep increasing it and Accredible is tackling the problem head on with innovative use of technology. We are a cloud-hosted web application where credential issuers can create deliver and manage their certificates and badges. These digital credentials are delivered to individuals via email or their learning platform and exist on a unique URL to be shared with third parties. We provide a number of verification tools that include blockchain record verification PDF validation and a directory of alumni. Using state of the art machine learning algorithms DAMVAD Analytics are able to identify 80 percent of the students who actually drop out more than six months in advance. This allows universities and other higher education institutions to intervene on an individual level to provide personal counseling to the students who need it the most. By aggregating the results it is also possible to identify problematic courses faculties or custom cohorts. This provides a cost-effective tool for driving retention both at an individual and institutional level. This is done solely on the institution’s own data on their students.

THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN DA-YOU JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL & YONG-AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL Many teenagers today are obsessed with the Internet which results in a disconnection from real natural/cultural environments. An after-school program providing flipped and interdisciplinary learning experience was initiated to combat this problem and raise K-12 students’ 21st century skills and awareness of natural/cultural heritage in their communities. Our pilot research study in Taiwan examined program outcomes in two schools. Student-created Augmented Reality (AR) / Virtual Reality (VR) products featuring local heritage sites were later embedded in formal curricula and used for teaching over 1 100 students. These positive results encourage us to expand this program to maximize the benefits. This is an IoT application & sensor/display that detects & alerts the presence of stress & anxiety in the user.

The Carbon Reduction Challenge is an initiative that empowers students to become lifelong champions of sustainable business in their organizations. We ask students who hold traditional internships and co-ops to identify and obtain approval for a project at their place of employment that reduces both greenhouse gas emissions and operating costs. The Challenge has attracted students from across all majors at Georgia Tech and in its latest cohorts expanded to include students participating from five more regional universities. To date the Challenge has engaged 75 students at 23 different organizations and avoided emissions of over 20 This prize will be given to the project that most successfully improves learning outcomes and/or employability outcomes for those undertaking an MBA or another form of Business & Management Education. We invite educators that are improving learning outcomes or course content for Online/Distance MBA programs to apply to this award discipline. The notion that a formal course in business administration might be as valuable a path for future businesspeople as immediate post-school real-life experience has steadily gained traction over the past century. There are now currently hundreds of thousands of MBA students worldwide and in 2014 it became It is clear that the MBA has enjoyed growth and retains its role as a pathway taken by many of the world’s business leaders despite the eye-watering costs often incurred by taking it. The proportion of young people seeking to become successful entrepreneurs is increasing. In an uncertain employment market the MBA is one of the few qualifications certain to provide value into the future. It is for precisely for these reasons that it cannot remain static. Automation threatens to transform employment beyond all recognition. Received notions about vertical corporate hierarchies are being questioned. The business leader of the future must be one able to negotiate the challenges and changes facing their role – and the MBA must remain a qualification suited to preparing them for that role. we seek projects and submissions that can demonstrate their ability to ensure tht MBA students receive the highest-quality teaching and learning possible. Projects might demonstrate the successful implementation of a new module or show that they have enhanced the effectiveness of a distance MBA. However all successful projects will be united by their ability to ensure that the MBA remains a program suited to preparing tomorrow’s leaders. ,"['34323107_0', '34323107_1', '34323107_2', '34323107_6', '34323107_7', '34323107_8', '34323107_10', '34323107_11', '34323107_12', '34323107_13', '34323107_14', '34323107_15', '34323107_16', '34323107_17', '34323107_18', '34323107_22', '34323107_23', '34323107_24', '34323107_25', '34323107_26', '34323107_27', '34323107_28', '34323107_29', '34323107_30', '34323107_31', '34323107_37']",Yes,"technology:0.21435150504112244,business:0.057430677115917206",

While the lifestyle change is challenging for the average person it is especially difficult for celebrities. ""Attention is like water for celebrities Don Tesh.  ""Without frequent attention they shrivel up and die.  They need the spotlight like a flower needs the sun."" Hundreds of stars have provided evidence for Tesch's claims.  Several have posted blurry videos of themselves playing songs alone in their bedrooms.  Others have shared clips of themselves cleaning their houses and performing other activities even normal people find boring. Celebrity host Brian Seacrest said this might be a new low for some of his high-profile acquaintances.  ""One of my friends just posted an Instagram Live video of himself clipping his fingernails.  No one wants to see that."" How out-of-touch are movie stars with the rest of society?  Just ask Gal Gadot who collaborated with several A-list celebrities attempting to sing ""Imagine"" by John Lennon.  The result was so cringeworthy it drew universal criticism across the sociopolitical spectrum.  As a silver lining disgust over the video has united people even more than the pandemic itself. The ""Imagine"" video has led governments around the world to implement new social distancing guidelines for celebrities.  Instead of the ""six-feet rule "" stars must follow the ""seven-day rule "" in which they can only publish one post per week.  The goal of the limitation is to flatten the curve of absurd and offensive posts by celebrities.

1620764520.53989,30568174,https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/King-William-IV/,“Sailor King” and “Silly Billy” were nicknames of William IV one of the most unlikely British kings and the oldest to receive the crown at the age of sixty-four. William IV had never expected to be king but despite this unlikely accession his rule proved to be productive eventful and more stable than that of his predecessors. He was born in August 1765 in Buckingham House Queen Charlotte.  His early life was much like any other young royal; he was privately tutored in the royal residence until at the age of thirteen when he decided to join the Royal Navy. Beginning his career as a midshipman his time in service saw him partake in the America War of Independence in New York as well as being present at the Battle of Cape St Vincent. Being such a high profile member of the Navy did however have its drawbacks none more so than when George Washington approved of the plan to kidnap him.  Fortunately for William the British received intelligence before the plot could be enacted and he was assigned a guard as protection. Whilst he was in the West Indies in the late 1780’s he served under the two men becoming very well-acquainted. As William served in the Royal Navy his prestige and title offered him allowances that would not have been extended to his peers none more so than when he was exonerated for his role in a drunken fight in he was given command of HMS Andromeda and a year later was appointed Rear-Admiral of HMS Valiant.  It was for this reason that when he came to inherit the throne he would become known as the “Sailor King”. his desire to be a duke like his brothers despite his father’s reservations led him to threaten to stand in the House of Commons for a Devon constituency.  His father unwilling for him to make a spectacle of himself relented and William became Duke of Clarence and St Andrews and Earl of Munster. he had left the Royal Navy and only three years later Britain went to war with France.  Expecting to be called up to serve his country his mixed messaging after publicly opposing the war in the House of Lords and later in the same year speaking in favour of it did nothing to help his chances of receiving a position. in 1798 he was made Admiral and later in 1811 although his positions were more honorary as he did not serve during the Napoleonic Wars. with no active position to serve in the Navy he turned his attention to matters of politics and spoke openly about his opposition towards the Since he had served in the West Indies many of his views reflected those of the plantation owners whom he had come into contact with during his stay. His views inevitably forced him into conflict with those figures who had been actively campaigning for its abolition none more so than the activist William Wilberforce whom he labelled as a “fanatic or hypocrite”. after leaving his role in the Royal Navy he took up a liaison with the actress “Mrs Jordan” otherwise known as Dorothea Bland.  She was Irish older than him and went by her stage name.  Their affair would be long lasting and result in ten illegitimate children who went by the name of FitzClarence. After twenty years together in seemingly domestic bliss he chose to end their union in 1811 providing her with a financial settlement and custody of her daughters on the condition that she would not return to being an actress. William chose to take custody and stop the maintenance payments.  For Dorothea Bland this decision would lead to her life spiralling out of control.  Whilst failing to resume her career she ran away from her debts to live and die in poverty in Paris in 1816. William knew he needed to find himself a wife particularly after the death of William’s niece who was the only legitimate child of the Prince Regent. Whilst the future King George IV was estranged from his wife it was unlikely he would be able to provide a legitimate heir.  It was at this moment that William’s position seemed to alter. Whilst several women were considered for the role eventually the choice was twenty-five year old Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Coburg Meiningen.  On 11th July 1818 William married Princess Adelaide and went on to have a twenty-year marriage producing two daughters who died in infancy. William’s oldest brother George inherited the throne from their father who had now succumbed to mental illness.  This left William second in line King George IV’s health took a turn for the worse and on 26th June he passed away leaving no legitimate heirs clearing the path for his younger brother now aged sixty-four to become king. Such was William’s elation that he drove around London unable to conceal his excitement. At his coronation in September 1831 his decision to have a modest ceremony helped contribute to his more down-to-earth image.  As he settled into his role as king William IV did his best to ingratiate himself with the public as well as those he worked with in parliament as noted by the Prime Minister at the time During his reign momentous changes took place none more so than the abolition of slavery in the colonies in 1833 a topic which he had previously shown much resistance to in the House of Lords. the Poor Law Amendment Act was introduced as a measure to assist in the provision of the poor through a system which would lead to the construction of across the country.  The Act was passed by a large majority and was seen at the time as a way of addressing the failures of the old system. Perhaps the most famous act to be passed during his reign was the Reform Act of 1832 which extended the franchise to the middle-classes whilst still judged by property restrictions. The choice to introduce such a reform was taken by Lord Grey after the defeat of Wellington and his Tory government in the general election of 1830. Initially such attempts at reform were shot down in 1831 with the First Reform Bill that was defeated at the House of Commons.  It was at this point that Grey urged William to dissolve parliament thus forcing a new general election so that Lord Grey could seek a greater mandate for parliamentary reform much to the dismay of the Lords. wanted to implement reform to an electoral system which had not seen any changes since the thirteenth century. The system was characterised by massive inconsistencies in parliamentary representation across the country.  In some northern and industrialised heartlands there were not even any MPs to represent the constituency whilst further south in Cornwall The introduction of the Reform Act caused a crisis leading to criticism resistance and controversy. Extended suffrage in real terms was still a difficult decision.  Some factions had called for universal male suffrage with no property restrictions whilst others believed it would disturb the status quo. the decision was made to increase the franchise whilst still retaining a property qualification.  Landed interests would thus remained intact whilst the first tentative steps at representation were being taken. The bill reflected the changing times and marked a significant move towards a constitutional monarchy. The Reform Act was not the only boost for Lord Grey and his government however: William went a stage further when he promised to create new peers in the House of Lords that were sympathetic to reform. William’s involvement in political affairs for the rest of his reign would extend to his choice of when he grew increasingly discontent with Lord Melbourne and his Whig government and instead chose to nominate Tory as the country’s leader.  This event would be the last time a monarch appointed a Prime Minister against the will of parliament. despite being relatively short was incredibly eventful.  As he neared the end of his life he engaged in a dispute with the Duchess of Kent whilst attempting to forge a closer relationship with her daughter As his health deteriorated and the end of his reign was in sight it would soon become clear that his young niece was set to become heir to the throne as he had no surviving legitimate children. his wife Adelaide by his side William IV passed away at Windsor Castle. He left behind an eventful legacy characterised by reform increased stability and a blueprint for constitutional monarchy. Copyright © Historic UK Ltd. Company Registered in England No. 5621230.

Here is a list of ten things that come to mind: The virus could be worse.  The coronavirus has a limited effect on children and younger people. Scientists have rapidly begun work on a vaccine that is already being tested. The world has unified to fight the virus. and Internet are still functioning normally. We have technology that allows people to work from home allowing most businesses to continue operating. People are spending more time with their families. Pollution is decreasing across the globe. It has provided a chance for us all to stop and reflect on what is important in life. We don't know what all the negative effects of the coronavirus will be.  But we also don't know all the positive ones.  Maybe we'll discover some new medical breakthroughs during the research process.  Maybe people will find new jobs that were better than their old ones.

The pandemic has hit midsize companies hard and rewarded Amazon and the other digital giants. Many midsize business leaders look at the growth of those giants and worry that there’s no place for them to prosper. In fact wide-open playing field for incumbent firms to reposition. The key to your midsize company’s survival in the post-pandemic period is to use the data you have readily available to identify your profit peaks and profit drains and strategically align your organization around your profit core to build dominance in your target market segments. The authors offer three steps that will provide a proven pathway to sustained defensible profit growth in the post-pandemic period and throughout the era beyond. The pandemic has changed the business environment dramatically both for B2C and B2B companies. Consumer behavior has shifted from in-store to online and to a significant extent . The flood of home deliveries has bankrupted scores of firms who traditionally relied on in-person interactions with midsize companies (with limited resources) hit especially hard. In the B2B markets buyer behavior has shifted just as dramatically. Electronic orders have displaced sales calls in many companies; one industrial distributor has seen its digital business climb steadily The digital giants have benefited from this shift and have grown in size and capability. is rapidly taking over huge swaths of the furniture market is relocating its local distribution facilities to enable two-hour deliveries of its various products. All companies have to adjust — but in particular who are very vulnerable but also potentially very agile. Their vulnerability stems from having fewer resources than their giant competitors and less diversification to shield against the impact of price wars. They can be agile if they have the resources to reposition and less-entrenched bureaucracies which makes it easier to innovate and change. Edison Furniture had a problem. Like most furniture retailers Edison (not its real name) made most of its profits selling mattresses. Internet sellers and off-price local stores were steadily eating into those profits. The company surveyed its large customers and found that most were price buyers. As a midsize retailer with a half-dozen large it was stuck in a price war that seemed hopeless. As the pandemic drove customers away from shopping at stores Edison’s management decided to try analyzing its profitability in a new way suggested by one of its directors: They created a database of their sales transactions and rather than allocating costs on a blanket basis they assigned their actual costs to each transaction. What they saw was amazing: About 20% of their customers accounted for half of their revenues but produced over more than 130% of their profits (i.e. About 30% of their customers accounted for a third of their revenues but drained more than The remaining 50% of their customers accounted for about 20% of their revenues but produced less than 10% of their profits (i.e. When Edison’s managers saw this profit segmentation they realized that their price-war strategy was a response to their profit drain customers’ demands and they were essentially ignoring their high-profit customers. They quickly sent a brief survey to their large customers separating the profit peak customers from the profit drains. They found that the profit peak customers were very retailer loyal and often had a favorite sales rep. While they weren’t necessarily wealthy they were relatively insensitive to prices. The profit drain customers were price shoppers. They started by shopping at Edison’s store then comparison shopped on the internet and finally returned to Edison to demand that they match the price. This was the big problem — and opportunity. Edison’s managers took several steps to address their problem: They created icons in their Salesforce system representing each customer’s profit segment (e.g. profit peak customer) so they could recognize these premier customers when they entered the store and send them to their favorite reps. They offered them special services like off-hours shopping They instructed their sales reps not to bargain with the profit drainers whom they could also recognize from Salesforce. They were surprised to find that most of these customers bought from the store anyway to avail themselves of Edison’s renowned service. They instructed their merchandisers to develop private-label lines which the profit peak customers preferred and which were also more profitable. They changed their advertising theme from low price to high quality and high service. who excelled in customer service in profit peak customers’ neighborhoods and had the other drivers shuttle loads to them. These master drivers handled all of the key customer interactions and scouted for their additional furniture needs while making the deliveries they carved out a defensible high-growth strategy that the digital giants and off-price competitors couldn’t match with their low-service Many midsize business leaders look at the growth of Amazon and the other digital giants and worry that there’s no place for them to prosper. In fact those giants have a very focused strategy — arm’s-length services to small customers — which leaves a large wide-open playing field for incumbent firms to reposition. Edison’s successful story highlights the three steps that midsize company leaders need to take for success in post-pandemic markets. Edison succeeded by identifying and developing a high-profit defensible strategy that the digital giants could not follow and it said “no” to customers that didn’t fit its target profile. focusing their strategic positioning and driving focused growth in today’s rapidly changing environment is a life-or-death necessity. This involves choosing your customers to target defensible profitable market segments while avoiding those that are vulnerable to digital giant incursion; aligning your scarce resources to capture and grow your target segments; and managing your organization to meet your diverging and changing customer needs within your target segments. Midsize companies also have to act quickly and decisively because if they lose their target markets to competitors they may not be able to recover them. Potentially getting in the way of this is that many midsize company managers instinctively try to cling to all revenues and cut all costs instead of carefully aiming and aligning their companies. Doubling down on the traditional strategy of choosing all customers — which is no strategy at all — coupled with across-the-board belt-tightening is a recipe for disaster. Edison aligned its resources around the processes and technologies that supported its chosen customers. Successful realigning of resources requires accurate granular profit analytics that show the profitability of every nook and cranny of your company and enable you to project the consequences of potential market changes and competitive incursions. Strategic repositioning requires a detailed understanding of which customers and products are in your current profit core (i.e. along with a projection of how the changing environment and aggressive competitors are altering the profit potential of your markets. And as competitors vie for repositioning success you only have one chance to get this right before your options evaporate. Today’s business environment creates both a huge opportunity and a major problem. The opportunity is that companies have the ability to carve out new businesses that are completely defensible against price-cutting competitors who have sophisticated digital marketing and a lower cost structure (because they simply send their products to their customers). The rise of the digital giants originated with their ability to market directly to customers which enabled them to create micro-segments and configure offers to individuals at scale using big data and algorithmic recommendations based on captured customer information. It’s extremely hard to win against these focused giants in a head-to-head contest. Yet many managers try to do this when they attempt to defend their broad market strategies instead of repositioning to dominate the defensible segments of their markets. The problem is that in the high-service realm where most of these opportunities reside customer needs are fragmenting rapidly: Different customers want different packages of products and related services. Historically most companies sold and delivered only a relatively narrow set of products and services to as many customers as possible in homogeneous mass markets. Edison developed effective new transaction-based metrics and managed the coordination of its key functional areas — sales and customer relationships — to produce the services their target customers wanted. The best news was that this repositioning didn’t require a large investment. The money they saved avoiding discounting paid for the whole program and produced ample profit growth. When managers try to calculate the profits from their expanding variety of customers and products in order to choose their targets and track their success they encounter a big problem: Traditional accounting systems cannot match each revenue increment with the actual cost of producing it. Standard metrics show the company’s average profitability but not the profitability of particular segments of customers and products. The problem is that traditional accounting categories tell you whether your company is making money but not where it’s making money. Companies now require a completely new way to analyze profitability below the averages of their traditional P&Ls all the way down to the invoice-line level which we call transaction-based profit metrics and analytics. Using new state-of-the-art software managers carefully assign the appropriate costs to each transaction (invoice line) creating an all-in P&L for each order line (the actual costs can be derived from a company’s general ledger). Because each order line has a set of unique identifiers (for example it’s possible to combine and recombine the relevant transactions on a monthly basis to show the actual profitability of every segment of the company down to each product bought by each customer each time. This is especially important because it shows a company’s rapidly shifting profit peaks and drains which were hidden by the average metrics and it enables managers to identify their emerging opportunities and risks quickly. Surviving in a New Era of Business We’ve entered a new era of business. We’re experiencing the end of the mass market era and accelerating into a new one which we call the “age of diverse markets.” In the age of mass markets which lasted through most of the previous century and mass communications integrated the nation’s markets and created strong economies of scale. In response companies sold relatively narrow product lines to as many customers as possible to maximize revenues and minimize costs. In the age of diverse markets which started accelerating around 2000 digital companies increasingly used the internet to micro-segment and fragment their markets selling directly to consumers. In response savvy incumbent firms increasingly shifted to higher-service strategies which further fragmented the markets. The pandemic has accelerated this change. The key to survival in the post-pandemic period and throughout this new era is to use the data you have readily available to identify your profit peaks and profit drains and strategically align your organization around your profit core (both current profits and your projected defensible market positioning) in order to build dominance in your target market segments.

1620764560.712789,41133939,https://www.historic-uk.com/CultureUK/Thomas-Cook/,2021 marks the 180th anniversary of Thomas Cook’s first step towards building the package holiday phenomenon. But ironically wealth and social standing was the last thing on Thomas’ mind throughout his varied and illustrious career. and music met us at Loughborough Station … and cheered us all along the line with the heartiest welcome … the whole affair being one which excited extraordinary interest not only in the county of Leicester but throughout the whole country … All went off in the best style … and thus was struck the keynote of my excursions and the social idea grew upon me.” Thus wrote an exuberant Thomas Cook after his first organised day out for working class people of the Temperance Movement on 5th July 1841. A society devoted to encouraging others to give up alcohol and to try education instead the Temperance members organised meetings readings and family picnics as an alternative to hours spent in a pub. A member of the movement himself Thomas decided to try something bigger to spread the word. Thomas believed in people helping themselves but recognised they could only do this if they were given the education and opportunity. At the same time he surmised that travel educated a person by broadening their mind and firing the imagination relaxing people and giving them hope. So he hoped to practise his ideas by arranging for 500 working class people to travel by train from Leicester to Loughborough to visit the Temperance quarterly meeting. this was their first time on a train. Despite travelling Third Class in open air carriages the whole trip was imbued with a holiday atmosphere with villagers waving flags at the side of the tracks and Loughborough station decorated with banners opened up his property Southfields for the day-trippers to use. White tablecloths were laid out under the shelter of trees and a typical English picnic of bread and ham and later crumpets and cake was consumed. Family games were arranged enjoyed before minister after minister made rousing speeches accompanied by the band. It was the biggest teetotal party they had ever seen. Thomas always wanted to help the poorer people in society as he had encountered his fair share of hardship. His father and stepfather both died when he was young and 10-year-old Thomas was apprenticed to a carpenter working long hours and spending his free time in church. He grew up wanting a fairer society and a better democracy. After Thomas married Marianne Mason in 1833 they opened up their home in Leicester to temperance travellers as local inns were noisy expensive and full of drunks. Leicester like many towns in the north of England had low life expectancy due to poor sanitation a lack of freshwater reservoirs hardly any drainage and an excess of factory pollution in the river Soar. It did a roaring trade in shoes and hosiery so there was the inevitable Victorian slum housing. According to the Temperance Messenger magazine Leicester was also home to 700 shops and pubs. It claimed the town had an above average amount of drunkards prostitutes and cases of alcohol related diseases. Fired up by the success of his first trip Thomas set to organising more cheap Temperance days out for the working classes volunteering his time and his own money to ensure success. Trips to Derby all underpinned by Thomas’ belief in feeding the soul with education and relaxation. In the summer of 1843 he took a crowd of Leicester teetotallers to the peaks of Derbyshire and parts of Yorkshire to breathe uncontaminated air. Thomas tirelessly promoted his trips by printing and distributing leaflets and posters throughout the town. He gave promotional talks in the local Temperance Hall. In fact trip wasn’t the first organised excursion by rail it was the first to be promoted through the use of print material and proved a resounding success. Thomas’ help for the working class didn’t stop at organising days out for them to try to forget their worries. He deeply abhorred alcohol and blamed it for the many problems the poor faced during the hungry Forties. He was a voracious anti-Corn Law protestor and orator damning the use of cereal crops to make alcohol when hundreds of thousands of people were starving across the country. and bought potato seeds to distribute among the working class to encourage them to grow their own food. He even started printing a gardening magazine called The Cottage Gardener covering the basics on how to grow vegetables and cultivate a cottage garden although the copies no longer exist. He went onto help found the Leicester Allotment Society as another way of helping the poor to be fed but self-sufficient. All this work came at the expense of Thomas’s own pocket and in August 1846 he filed for bankruptcy. Luckily this no longer meant the shame and prison sentence it used to and Thomas held onto his printing works and his home. This did teach him a valuable lesson though: he needed to make a hefty profit to continue helping the poor and the best way to do this was to organise excursions for the middle classes. Thomas had already decided to take the plunge in 1845 when he gathered up his courage and advertised his first commercial tour to Liverpool with the opportunities to climb Mount Snowdon explore Bangor and sail in a steamboat along the way all backed up with his printed historical booklets. Despite tickets costing 10-15 shillings each so clearly aimed at the middle class demand for this trip far outstripped supply and another was planned a fortnight later. Thomas had found his niche. Cook’s Tours was born. Although the company went on to become a package holiday phenomenon Thomas never cared for gentrification. Large houses country pursuits and members clubs passed him by as he continued to promote cheap travel for the masses. he fell out with his son as John Mason wanted to stop all non-profit making tours but this went against everything Thomas stood for. He said of his son “He does not like my mixing of missions with business; but he cannot deprive me of the pleasure I have had in the combination.” Thomas’ last act of philanthropy was to build a pretty row of 14 memorial cottages and gardens in Melbourne a bakery and a laundry. Four flats were included for visiting Baptist ministers and their families and a caretaker oversaw the upkeep. When Thomas died on 18th July 1892 he had just £2731 in his bank. summed up Thomas Cook in the Leicester Daily Post on the 20th July: “Thousands and thousands of the inhabitants of these islands who never would for a moment have passed beyond its shores have been able to go and return in safety and comfort great refreshment and great improvement to themselves.” Written by Shona Parker.

Construction of the Pennsylvania State House which came to be known as Independence Hall began in 1732. It was a symbol of the nation to come. At the time it was the most ambitious public building in the thirteen colonies. The Provincial government paid for construction as they went along so it was finished piecemeal. It wasn't until 1753 21 years after the groundbreaking before it was completed. It was the original ""Philadelphia lawyer "" none other than Andrew Hamilton that oversaw the planning and worked to guarantee its completion. Hamilton had won renown for his successful 1735 in New York that was to become a freedom-of-the-press landmark. The building has undergone many restorations notably by Greek revival architect and by a committee from the National Park Service returning it to its 1776 appearance. the birthplace of the United States. It was within its walls that the was adopted. It was here that the drafted and signed. That document is the oldest federal constitution in existence and was framed by a convention of delegates from 12 of the original 13 colonies. Rhode Island did not send a delegate. George Washington presided over the debate which ran from May to September 1787. The draft comprising a preamble and seven Articles was submitted to all thirteen states and was to take effect when ratified by nine states. On June 21 approved it and it became effective in March 1789. Notable among the document's many innovative features is the separation of powers among the legislative (Congress) and judicial branches of government. Also important is that the Congress was split into two houses the upper house (originally in the upper floor of adjoining Congress Hall) and the lower house (main floor of Congress Hall); the first gave equal power to all the states regardless of size and the second gave proportional representation according to size. You have to imagine the debates between the large and small states each attempting to form a government favoring them. You also have to marvel that this compromise was reached at all — a tribute to the extraordinary minds that were working together to make a new nation that could survive and renew itself in the face of unforeseeable obstacles. The basement once served as the city's dog pound The second floor was once home to Charles Willson Peale's museum of natural history. Some historians note that Ben Franklin would occasionally trip other delegates from his aisle seat. knowing that his opinion would carry undue weight contributed little to the debate over the Constitution. Even though the days were very hot in the summer of 1787 windows were kept closed so others could not overhear their discussions Chestnut Street between 5th & 6th Streets Tours of Independence Hall are organized by means of timed tickets.

1620764589.378325,36639550,https://pc.net/news/2020-02-29/apple_watch_nike_series_5_review,"Apple Watch Nike Series 5 Review They say you don't know what you got until it's gone.  With technology sometimes you don't know what you're missing until you upgrade. I finally upgraded my old Apple Watch Series 2 to a new Series 5 ""Nike"" watch at the end of 2019.  I should have upgraded a long time ago.  Maybe I was nostalgic after wearing the same watch on my wrist for several years.  Or maybe I was hesitant to trade in my old model because by the last two iPhones.  Whatever the reason the Series 5 is just another Apple Watch.  In other ways it is significantly better.  Based on my experience over the past three months here are my top reasons to upgrade: The Series 5 is fast.  It is extremely responsive and loads apps way faster than the Series 2.  Granted the Series 2 was slow when I bought it and even slower a few years later but the speed of the Series 5 isn't even comparable.  A few minutes testing the watch at the Apple Store was all I needed to confirm this but I'm happy to say the speed continues to impress me in everyday use. of flash storage.  Good luck finding this information on Apple's website.  It's there but mysteriously hidden.  I don't understand why Apple doesn't promote this feature since it's a big deal.  The Series 2 had a of 4GB.  The Series 5 has eight times more.  The difference is significant because I could only fit a small amount of my iTunes library on my old watch.  I can fit more than half of my 50-gigabyte library on this one.  Now when I workout I don't have to listen to the same playlist every time. The screen on the Series 5 is slightly bigger than the Series 2.  But the small bump in size makes a big difference.  Everything is more readable and easier to navigate.  I found myself accidentally tapping the wrong things on my old watch but that rarely happens on this one. The Series 2 could only display email messages.  I was pleasantly surprised to learn the Series 5 displays making it a practical means of checking my email.  I decided to add the email app to my home screen which didn't make sense on my old watch. The main difference between the Series 4 and the Series 5 is that the 5 includes an ""always-on"" display.  It doesn't go black whenever you put your arm down like all previous Apple Watches.  I've gotten so used to this new feature I take for granted being able to check the time without performing the ""raise to wake"" motion. What I Don't Like About the Series 5 The Apple Watch Series 5 is a considerable improvement over the Series 2.  But I still think there are still several ways to make the Apple Watch better. Get rid of that stupid ""digital crown"" on the side of the watch. It is pointless and often gets in the way.  The first thing I did after buying the Series 5 was reverse the default orientation so I can have the button facing away from my hand.  A long touchpad along the side of the watch would be much better Provide an option to only show the time by default. but it shows too much data and looks cluttered with the modular watch face.  You can hide personal data in the Apple Watch settings but I would prefer if the watch face just showed the time when inactive. the Series 5 doesn't always detect my ""stand hours"" correctly.  For example then walked back upstairs to my office.  My Apple Watch still didn't register that I had stood up.  That is pretty concerning and makes me wonder how accurate the activity tracking is. I am pleased with the Apple Watch Series 5 Nike edition.  I mainly use it for tracking my workouts and playing music with my AirPods at the gym.  But I also use it to read text messages and pay at retail stores.  If you already own an Apple Watch Series 4 the Series 5 is probably not worth the upgrade.  But I think it is worth considering if you have a Series 3 and definitely worthwhile if you have a Series 1 or 2. The Apple Watch Nike Series 5 is not perfect and I hope Apple continues to improve it in future versions.  I listed a few things I don't like and I could put together an even longer list of suggestions for Apple.  But the fact is I use my Apple Watch every day and that speaks for itself.

1620764593.3959901,84712539,https://newpol.org/in-memoriam-kai-nielsen-1926-2021/,"for many years a sponsor of passed away on March 29 in Montreal only a few weeks away from what would have been his 95 Kai was born in Michigan and grew up in northern Illinois. Many years later he wrote that growing up during the Great Depression “marked me very deeply. It is not that I suffered personally. My parents were comfortably off. But it was what I saw around me. I went sometimes to play at the homes of my school chums many of whom lived in ramshackle houses practically bare of furniture and barely heated. Their mothers were there with faces pinched with hunger… I concluded at a very early age that there must be something terribly wrong and even irrational in what we call the developed world for it to be like that… So socialism came early to me and remained like water to ducks.” Kai served in the Merchant Marine in the Pacific at the end of World War Two before studying at St. Ambrose College in Iowa and the University of North Carolina. He was a graduate student at Duke University and was awarded his Ph.D. in 1959 for a thesis on moral reasoning. academic jobs were easy to find and he became an assistant professor first at Hamilton College in upstate New York and shortly afterwards in the Department of Philosophy and Religion at Amherst College in Massachusetts. But Kai was a convinced atheist which did not go down well with his department chair. So when Sidney Hook paid a visit to Amherst and offered Kai a job at New York University Kai was a prolific writer. In the 1950s and 1960s he published a stream of articles on ethics philosophy of religion (especially on the case for atheism) and the nature of philosophy itself (a topic known as meta-philosophy). These were issues that continued to fascinate him for the rest of his life but as the sixties progressed Kai’s attention was increasingly drawn to social and political questions He described his politics when he went to NYU as “Deweyan social democracy. I thought that if we would hold on to our brains and be patient and eventually in the world could in time end up like Sweden. The Vietnam War changed that. It was an eye-opener for me. In being part at that time of the internal resistance in the United States I became convinced that such liberal reformist measures would never work and slowly I became a Marxist as I would now prefer to call it By the end of the 1960s Kai was a full professor and chair of the NYU Philosophy Department but he was also frustrated by the continuing Vietnam War and disillusioned with politics in the United States. When he was given the opportunity to move to the University of Calgary in Canada at the beginning of the 1970s Kai was writing on topics such as civil disobedience and US foreign policy. In 1975 ” the first of many articles on Marxist philosophy. As Kai summarized the article he examined “a central problem about Marxism and morality. Marx exposes moralism and exhibits the ideological functions of morality and requires objectively true moral norms for his critique of capitalism and defense of socialism. I set forth a way of looking at Marx and Marxism which shows how two apparently conflicting elements in Marxism form a coherent whole.” Fourteen years later Marxism and the Moral Point of View: Morality Kai gave his longest and most detailed answers to these questions. I met Kai when I was a philosophy graduate student at Calgary in the early 1980s. In fact he was the first person with whom I studied Marx. On my first day in the department I walked into his seminar on “Marx and Morality” in which we read a collection of papers that were soon to be published in a which Kai was editing. It was a wonderful introduction to Marxism and to serious philosophical discussion. Kai came prepared each week with a long commentary on the readings. After he had read that aloud with Kai inviting—and relishing the chance to respond to—disagreements. I grew to know Kai as a warm and generous person who often held informal department gatherings and discussion groups at his home. Kai was also always engaged with contemporary political issues. I remember him bringing the Canadian journalist Stan Persky who had just returned from Poland and was writing a book on the Solidarność trade union movement’s challenge to the regime to speak on campus shortly after the Polish government had declared martial law. Kai continued to teach at Calgary until his retirement in the 1990s at which point he moved to Montreal. But soon he was teaching again part-time at Concordia University. Kai also remained politically active. After initially being skeptical he became a strong supporter of Quebec sovereignty. And his commitment to socialism never wavered. A younger colleague recalls accompanying Kai to the April 2001 global justice protests in Quebec City against the Free Trade Area of the Americas: “We were tear gassed a couple of times and I did my best to keep Kai from getting crushed by the crowds (he was in his seventies). During a parade that was part of the protest we stood on the edge of the road and Kai raised his fist in the air in solidarity as the labor union and Marxist banners went by his eyes full of tears and hopes for a better world.” Kai continued to write well into his nineties. By the time he died he had published 21 books (and edited several more) and over 400 professional articles. He also left behind several unpublished book manuscripts and dozens of unpublished articles and contemporary politics. Much of this work is collected on his Kai attempted to articulate a conception of a “meaningful and desirable life” for everyone and to show that this conception is compatible with reality. “I speak here of a conception of a flourishing world for all where there will be no poor. I want such a world. I seek again and again in various ways to clearly … articulate what this world would be like and how it could be achieved.” has lost a friend and the world is a poorer place without him.

The symbol was seen across Europe during from wall graffiti to plane formations. Belgian Minister of Justice representing the French ‘victoire’/victory and Dutch ‘vrijheid’/freedom. the BBC initiated its V For Victory campaign. Foreign language broadcasts began with the opening four notes of Ludwig van Beethoven’s Symphony V since known as the Victory Symphony. These notes neatly parallel the Morse Code pattern for the letter V (3 dots and a dash). Incidentally the Victory Symphony was composed between 1804 and 1808 – by which time Beethoven himself was deaf. In diaries and letters he attests he had developed labyrinthitis and difficulty identifying words and high sounds. He begged friends to keep his deafness a ‘profound secret’. He was shocked at those who did ‘not notice my condition at all’ but considered him ‘absent-minded’. Beethoven had ‘both conductive and sensorineural loss’ Bella Bathurst informs in her book Sound. Conductive loss occurs from damage to the ‘mechanical processes’ of the outer and middle ears which deliver sound-waves to the inner ear which in turn transforms these  into signals the brain can decipher. Thus the brain processes’. Prudent for this article Bathurst analogises this as ‘a physical Enigma code’… The Enigma machine was invented for Germany towards the end of WWI. British code-breakers’ work to decode the transmissions was invaluable to the Allied victory. Likewise the inner ear’s translations are essential to hearing and comprehension and indeed survival. WWI soldiers reported their hearing loss was due to reluctance to use issued ear protection not least because hearing a grenade pin drop was the difference between life and death. 000 soldiers were deafened during WWI according to historian Peter Brown. Contemporary poetry indicates some of the last sounds they heard clearly: ‘ […] deaf even to the hoots/ Of tired outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind’ (Dulce Et Decorum Est fly/ Scarce heard amid the guns below’ (In Flanders Fields Deafened soldiers received half the disability pension of those who had been blinded but 31 UK centres were established to teach lip-reading. Contrastingly many professionals considered soldiers’ deafness to be fictitious. Doctors and psychiatrists claimed it was psychosomatic due to ‘a lack of moral fibre’ Bathurst reports. US army protocol was to treat sufferers with sodium pentothal a chemical truth serum. This was to force a confession of dishonesty rather than alleviate pain and loss. Deaf men were keen to “share the Empire’s work” as one man wrote to Lord Kitchener. In 1917 a French newspaper reported deaf people had been trained as munitions workers. Britain’s Margate Deaf School reported 8 pupils left for similar employment. They made everything from testing shells and fuses to tools and wheels. Furthermore a deaf volunteer battalion was apparently trained in drill and tunnel digging. devastating losses occurred on the Home Front due to a disastrous lack of awareness. A number of deaf people were “randomly shot while walking home from work cycling or generally getting on with life” as historian Norma McGilp informs. Why? As the BDT reported they were “unable to hear the challenges of the sentries” and so “when they continued to walk Some managed to join the army. Harry Ward Gomer Jones and Frederick Morffew were a few. Ward signed on with the Royal Munster Fusiliers and did basic training at the Curragh Camp in Ireland. Private Jones was the best marksman in his company. A former road worker from Petersham Morffew served for over a month before discovery of his deafness led to discharge. Determined he joined the labour corps and was posted to France. His granddaughter commemorated Adolf Hitler’s rampage against “undesirables” included disabled people – of which many deaf Germans did not count themselves a part. Some formed a paramilitary Sturmabteilung/SA group called the Reich Union of the Deaf. They marched in support of the Nazi ideology spread its propaganda and actively ostracised deaf Jews. The group was eventually disbanded by Goering. 000 deaf Germans were sterilised in Nazi-occupied Germany. Of 600 deaf Jews who lived in Berlin whilst the persecution of deaf Germans and Jews began the International Games for the Deaf took place in Sweden. Great Britain was one of 13 participants. On the eve of all British citizens were ordered home from Sweden for their safety. badges were issued to as many deaf people as possible: a luminous circle on which ‘DEAF’ was written. Deaf people were instructed to point their badges down outdoors lest they attracted enemies in the skies. were lost on the Deaf community which relied on friends and families to relay news.  Newspapers and moving pictures were essential. Following the popularity of the BBC’s V for Victory campaign Churchill adopted the sign in 1941. He alternated the palm-forward V of virtue and dorsal-hand V of vice at whim projecting victorious peace and hostility for the Nazi enterprise. However individuals such as Vera Hunt reported that families used to hide newspapers to put fear at bay excluding deaf people from this solidarity. Furthermore the V sign is not exactly transferable into British Sign Language. In BSL connects to the war under discussion). the normal pain threshold is marked at around 120dB. British standards mandate that employers must not allow prolonged noise levels over 85dB in the workplace. A pneumatic drill two metres away measures 126dB. An alarm clock is 90dB.  A gun-blast measures at about 140dB the same as hearing a jet plane taking off about 40m away. endemic’ consequence of working in the armed forces according to Professor Mark Haggard honorary vice-president of Deafness Research UK. Exposure to close-combat fighting roadside devices and low-flying coalition aircraft has left over two-thirds of British troops who fought in Afghanistan with severe to permanent hearing loss. A study conducted by Deafness Research UK and the Ministry of Defence found that of 1 254 troops following a six-month tour 865 displayed signs of severe hearing damage. 69% of the Royal Marines showed signs of NIHL (noise-induced hearing loss). There is only one army in the world that does not exclude deaf people. The Israeli Defence Force trains and employs deaf soldiers. Interpreters are provided during training. Often these soldiers are employed for cartography and office work. Whilst deaf people are otherwise globally excluded from the services it is statistically only a matter of time before many soldiers develop hearing damage and loss. By Eve Bolt.

Before I choose a new one for 2020 let's see how WDC performed in 2019. The price of WDC on January 1 2019 was 36.97.  The stock hit its 2019 high of 65.31 on September 13 .  It finished the year at 63.47 for a one-year return of .  WDC also has a healthy dividend which started the year over 5% and is now at 3.15% thanks to the higher stock price. My criteria for a successful stock pick are simple: The one-year return (Jan 1 to Dec 31) must be positive. The one-year return must beat the S&P 500. WDC was a successful stock pick for 2019 more than doubling the performance of the S&P My stock pick for this year is... .  It is currently trading at $20.07 per share. Fastly had its IPO in May last year so it hasn't even had its one-year birthday as a publically traded company.  Fastly is much smaller than Western Digital so you can expect more volatility in the stock.  In fact it has already had a bit of a wild ride (see below).  However Fastly's relatively small size (~$2 billion market cap) means it has more opportunity for growth and a higher return. Fastly is an ""edge cloud platform"" that provides content and computing power from dozens of locations around the world ( ).  These locations comprise the ""edge network"" where content and computing power is delivered from a nearby location to users around the world. Common applications of Fastly's technology include content delivery networks (CDNs) and edge computing.  These services allow businesses to provide their content (websites etc) to customers much faster than from a single location. Fastly is one of several edge cloud platforms.  Two notable competitors include the much larger Akamai (AKAM) with a market cap of $14 billion and the more comparable Cloudflare (NET) with a market cap of $5.1 billion.  I use Akamai's CDN for my websites and it has been extremely solid with zero performance issues in the past two years.  While I like Akamai I see more opportunity for growth with Fastly.  Fastly's edge computing service ""Compute@Edge"" looks especially promising though I do think they could have chosen a better name. I always choose my investments based on the risk-reward ratio.  FSLY has more risk than WDC but the reward is much greater.  Similar to why I chose WDC last year I think the downside risk to FSLY is limited while the upside potential is high.  Even a move from $20 to $30 is a 50% gain which I think is reasonable for 2020.  Based on the institutional investors who own FSLY I don't expect the stock to drop below 15. nothing is guaranteed in the stock market.  Maybe the entire stock market will have a significant drop in 2020 taking most of the tech stocks with it.  Or maybe WDC will perform even better this year like my 2018 stock pick which was up 148% in 2019.  The point is this article is an opinion not professional investment advice.

1620764629.335789,90015622,https://hbr.org/2021/03/should-midsize-companies-play-offense-or-defense-in-a-downturn,Research on the Great Recession found that aggressive companies outperformed those that hunkered down. Recessions are hard on midsize companies who tend to play defense by implementing across-the-board cuts during tough times. But it’s not the only strategy and likely not the best one. The authors examine three categories of investments — capital expenditures and talent — midsize companies made before and after the 2007–2009 recession. Their findings show that companies that increased investments during the recession showed improvement in return on equity and market values in the recovery phase following the recession. This presents opportunities to attract new talent and lock in long-term financing Despite the roaring stock market and $3 trillion of relief money provided by the U.S. government 2020 will count as a recession year . While the economy isn’t yet back to normal Recessions are tough for most companies especially midsize ones. Such companies lack the financial muscle that allows large companies to make brave moves during a recession. For mid-size companies credit is difficult to come by and almost every financial metric turns red. What should such firms do during a recession particularly as they rethink their strategy midway through it? In our work with midsize companies we usually find that the natural response is to play defense: Cut costs and preserve the remaining cash to last through the tough phase. But is playing defense the only strategy? Is it the best strategy? We provide data-based evidence of the optimal strategy for the midway point of a recession. What we found shows that playing offense could be a better choice for midsize firms than playing defense provided they can pull it off. examined the best strategy during the 1980 crisis (which lasted from 1980 to 1982) the 1990 slowdown (1990 to 1991) and the 2000 dotcom bust (2000 to 2002). It concluded that companies that master the delicate balance between cutting costs and making forward-looking investments do well after a recession. The article also acknowledges that this prescription is not easy to follow. Not many companies are ambidextrous — that is able to make long-term investments while achieving cost efficiencies and rationalizing their workforce. We examined a more recent recession to revisit the question of optimal strategy. Instead of focusing on all companies we focused on the industries that are typically most affected by a recession such as aircraft and shipbuilding and steel. These are also the industries that have been most affected by the current pandemic . We didn’t examine R&D–intensive industries — such as electronics and biotechnology — for which continual innovation is not a luxury but a survival strategy. In addition we examined only midsize companies that were in the middle 40% by market value just before the start of the recession (that is at the end of 2006). We examined periods of three years (2010 to 2012). We contrasted the changes in recovery-phase performance of the companies that increased investments during the recession with those that decreased them. Because financial numbers are not comparable across time we adjusted them for inflation. We ignored companies with small changes in investments. We identified companies that were in the highest quartile (that is the top 25%) in terms of percentage change in investments and compared them to those in the lowest quartile. Thus we contrasted only those companies that made significant changes to their investment plans. We examined three categories of investments: Talent as measured by the number of people employed We examined three measures of success: Improvements in return on equity and market value of company stock. Since numbers may not be comparable across periods of recession and recovery and the sample of composition of firms changes over time we converted our measures into percentile ranks. For example a company was considered successful if its market value improved to 40th-percentile rank in the recovery phase from 55th-percentile rank during the recession. Figures 1 through 3 show our findings which are stark and instructive. The firms that increased investments during the recession showed improvement in return on equity and market values in the recovery phase. Companies that decreased investment showed deterioration on all three counts. playing offense dominates playing defense. What could be the reason? The principal reason is that recessions are inevitably followed by expansions which typically last longer than the recessions. (The expansions after the 1980–1981 crisis and the 1990–1991 slowdown lasted eight years the one after the 2000–2002 bust lasted six years and the one after the great recession of 2007–2009 lasted 10 years.) Recessions are fertile ground for our prescription is that a CEO must consider recessions as opportunities. For some companies they’re advantageous anyway. For example very well during the 2008 recession when customers turned toward budget sellers. Similarly 2020 has been a great year for Amazon. Yet even for industries battered by recession it’s the best time to take advantage of the following opportunities for the forthcoming expansion: Companies can attract ambitious employees who would thrive in a forward-looking growth-oriented environment. Talent is not only available at a lower salary but is also more accessible. It’s an opportune time to conduct mergers and acquisitions and consolidate when valuations are low and competitors are willing to hive off divisions. It’s an ideal time to deploy new technologies whose deployment during a boom phase would slow down the firm’s profit engine. There’s an opportunity to attract dissatisfied customers from competitors by offering superior products and services. To the extent that the government infuses liquidity into the economy and interest rates go down it could be an advantageous time to lock in long-term financing. A notable example of playing offense during a recession is Samsung. It increased its R&D and marketing expenses and hired the best brand managers during the 2008­–2009 financial crisis and emerged as a formidable player in mobile phones market Why don’t most firms follow this strategy? Because their long-term vision gets fogged up by the day-to-day exigencies: Cancelled contracts banks’ refusal to provide additional working capital and cash-starved suppliers’ insistence on cash payments instead of extending credit. Firms come under intense pressure from investors to do something about deteriorating financial performance. CEOs cave and announce policies aimed at pleasing stock markets such as reducing operating costs; shrinking discretionary expenditures like R&D and advertising; eliminating frills such as offsite meetings and team-building exercises; delaying brand launches; rationalizing business portfolios; postponing buying assets like plants and machinery; firing contract workers; and lowering head count. They often resort to zero-based budgeting to start questioning every expenditure. But restructuring and laying off workers might be the worst actions firms can take during recessions. According to if you lay off employees when you’re halfway through a recession you still have to pay six-month severance pay which means you only realize those savings after six months. Suppose the recession lasts for another 12 months. In order to gear up production you need to hire new workers six months ahead of time. So you really don’t save much but you do destroy morale and incur additional rehiring costs. Workers with low morale are unlikely to offer innovative solutions to problems which causes product and service quality to suffer and leads to more unsatisfied customers. Notably finance departments usually do “across-the-board” cuts instead of a more judicious rationalizing of investments and saving at least a few future-oriented projects from the universal axe. we believe that playing defense particularly late in a recession is not the optimal strategy for midsize companies. On the contrary it could be the best time to prepare for a forthcoming expansion. And given the lower costs of forward-looking plans during a recession such a strategy would provide better return on investments in capital and talent than it would during the expansionary phase. is the Coxe Distinguished Professor at Dartmouth College’s Tuck School of Business and faculty partner at the Silicon Valley incubator bestselling author.

The Match Girls’ Strike was industrial action taken up by the workers of the Bryant and May factory against the dangerous and unrelenting demands which endangered their health with very little remuneration. women and young girls from the surrounding area would turn up at 6:30 in the morning to start a long fourteen hour shift of perilously dangerous and gruelling work with a virtually non-existent financial recognition at the end of the day. With many of the girls starting their life at the factory at thirteen years of age the demanding physicality of the job took its toll. The match workers would be required to stand for their work all day and with only two scheduled breaks any unscheduled toilet break taken would be deducted from their meagre wages.  Furthermore whilst the pittance earned by each worker was barely enough to live on the company continued to thrive financially with dividends of 20% or more given to its shareholders. The factory was also inclined to issue out a number of fines as a result of misdemeanours including having an untidy work station or talking which would see the low wages of the staff cut even more dramatically. Despite many of the girls being forced to work bare-footed as they could not afford shoes in some cases having dirty feet was another reason for a fine thus subjecting them to further hardship by deducting their wages even further. The healthy profits made by the factory were unsurprising particularly as the girls had to have their own supplies such as brushes and paint whilst also being forced to pay the boys who provided the frames for boxing up the matches. Through this inhumane sweat shop system the factory could navigate the restrictions imposed by the Factory Acts which was legislation created in an attempt to halt some of the more extreme industrial working conditions. Other dramatic ramifications of such work also affected the health of these young women and girls With no attention paid to health and safety some of the instructions given included “never mind their fingers” as the workers were forced to operate dangerous machinery. abuse from the foreman was a common sight in such demoralising and abusive working conditions. One of the worst ramifications included a disease called “phossy jaw” which was an extremely painful type of bone cancer caused by the phosphorus in the match production leading to horrendous disfiguration of the face. The production of match sticks involved dipping the sticks made from poplar or pine wood into a solution made up of many ingredients including phosphorus antimony sulphide and potassium chlorate.  Within this mixture there were variations in the percentage of white phosphorus however the use of it in production would prove to be extremely dangerous. It was only in the 1840’s that the discovery of red phosphorus which could be used on the striking surface of the box made the use of white phosphorus in the matches no longer necessary. the use of it in the Bryant and May factory in London was enough to cause widespread problems.  When someone inhaled phosphorus common symptoms such as toothache would be reported however this would lead to the development of something much more sinister.  Eventually as a result of the heated phosphorus being inhaled the jaw bone would begin to suffer a necrosis and essentially the bone would start to die. Fully aware of the impact of “phossy jaw” the company chose to deal with the problem by giving the instruction of tooth removal as soon as anyone complained of an ache and if anyone dared refuse Bryant and May was one of twenty-five match factories in the country of which only two did not use white phosphorus in their production technique. With little desire to change and compromise on profit margins Bryant and May continued to employ thousands of women and girls in its production line many of Irish descent and from the poor surrounding area.  The matchmaking business was booming and the market for it continued to grow. after growing discontent over the poor working conditions the final straw came in July 1888 when one female worker was wrongfully dismissed.  This was the result of a newspaper article which exposed the brutal conditions of the factory which prompted the management to force signatures from its workers refuting the claims.  Unfortunately for the bosses many workers had had enough and with the refusal to sign a worker was dismissed triggering off outrage and the subsequent strike that followed. The article had been prompted by activists Annie Besant and Herbert Burrows who were key figures in organising the industrial action. Herbert Burrows and the Matchgirls Strike Committee It was Burrows who had first made contact with the workers in the factory and later Besant met with many of the young women and heard their appalling stories.  Prompted by this visit she soon published an exposé where she gave details of the working conditions comparing it to a “prison-house” and depicting the girls as “white wage slaves”. Such an article would prove to be a bold move as the matchstick industry was very powerful at the time and had never been successfully challenged before now. The factory was understandably outraged to learn of this article which gave them such bad press and in the days that followed made the decision to force the girls into a full-scale denial. they had completely misread the growing sentiments and instead of oppressing the women it emboldened them to down tools and travel to the offices of the newspaper in Fleet Street. many more match girls came out in support quickly igniting the walkout into a full-scale strike of around 1500 workers. Besant and Burrows proved crucial in organising the campaign which led the women through the streets whilst setting out their demands for an increase in pay and better working conditions. Such a display of defiance was met with great public sympathy as those who saw them pass by cheered and offered their support.  Moreover an appeal fund set up by Besant received a great many donations including from powerful bodies such as the London Trades Council. With the support triggering public debate the management were keen to play down the reports claiming it was “twaddle” propagated by socialists like Mrs Besant. the girls spread their message defiantly including a visit to Parliament where the contrast of their poverty against the wealth of Westminster was a confronting sight for many. the factory management wanted to mitigate their bad publicity as soon as possible and with the public very much on the side of the women the bosses were forced to compromise just weeks later offering improvements in both pay and conditions most notably including the abolition of their stringent fining practices. It was a victory not seen before against the powerful industrial lobbyists and a sign of changing times as the public mood had empathised with the plight of working women. Another effect of the strike was a new match factory in the Bow area set up in 1891 by the Salvation Army offering better wages and conditions and no more white phosphorus in production.  Sadly the extra costs incurred by changing many of the processes and the abolition of child labour resulted in the failure of the business. it would take over a decade for the Bryant and May factory to stop using phosphorus in its production despite the changes that were imposed by the industrial action. after years of public awareness of the disastrous health impact of white phosphorus the House of Commons finally passed an act prohibiting its use in matches. a notable effect of the strike was the creation of a union for the women to join which was extremely rare as female workers did not tend to be unionised even into the next century. The match girl strike had provided an impetus for other working class labour activists to set up unskilled worker unions in a wave that became known as “New Unionism”. The 1888 match girl strike had paved the way for important changes in the industrial setting but more still needed to be done.  Its most tangible impact was perhaps the growing public awareness about the conditions lives and health of some of the poorest in society whose neighbourhoods were a far cry from those of the decision makers in Westminster.

From the practicality of a Roman aqueduct to the art of the written word man has always adapted his environment to meet his needs and to provide himself with sustenance a higher quality of living and a thriving culture. This concise reference source takes a closer look at six technological events that significantly impacted the evolution of civilization from the Palaeolithic age to the height of the Roman Empire. As he touches on the common elements of ancient technology--energy and communication--Humphrey asks questions central to understanding the impact of ancient tools on the modern world: What prompts change? What cultural traditions inhibit change? What effect do these changes have on their societies and civilization?  Humphrey explores technologies as both physical tools and as extensions of the human body beginning with the invention of the Greek alphabet and including such accomplishments as early Neolithic plant cultivation the building of the Parthenon and Rome's urban water system. Detailed line drawings of tools and machines make ancient mechanics more easily accessible. Primary documents and a timeline dating from the Palaeolithic age to the Roman Empire round out the work making this an ideal reference source for understanding the tools of the ancient world.

1620764671.827636,34469097,https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofBritain/British-Intelligence-In-World-War-One/,British Intelligence in the Great War Great War of 1914 – 1918 was the epicentre of change for not only a whole generation and their society and importantly – modern British Intelligence. Cited as a war of attrition the first ‘modern war’ required a co-operative and institutionalised intelligence service if the Allies were to successfully ‘wear down’ the Central Powers with military technological capability and sufficient resources. Before The First World War and the subsequent period of rapid technological advance British Intelligence was seen to be rather cloak and dagger and was incredibly limited in terms of size and ability. The pre-war years were filled with fear over German Imperial expansion and stories of German spies on British soil: when war was to break Intelligence would be essential to British success. in its most simple form is really just knowledge and was available in three forms throughout The Great War: Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Image Intelligence (IMINT) and Human Intelligence (HUMINT). SIGINT played an incredibly important and varied role throughout the war whilst IMINT and HUMINT were somewhat unreliable and fragmentary. IMINT gathered geographical intelligence in the form of enemy troop locations but its value diminished once the front lines had solidified and German troops had ‘dug in’. HUMINT was regarded as the most important form of intelligence as primary source accounts are usually most reliable. HUMINT successes were often few and far between but were valuable in the cumulative insight they allowed. In May 1917 British Intelligence struck gold when a German deserter bought with him the latest version of the German Post Office directory; this listed the location of every mailing office in the German army and allowed the British to pinpoint the location of individual units. The British Army was then able to maintain an understanding of the German Army’s order-of-battle and fulfil the aim of intelligence: to minimise uncertainty about the enemy and to maximise the efficiency of the use of one’s own resources. ‘German prisoner captured in a raid pointing out to Staff Officer the dispositing of his unit’ Another incredibly important form of HUMINT was found outside the battlefield and in the interconnected networks of La Dame Blanche – a female resistance organisation victorious in infiltrating German intelligence in Belgium and Northern France. Female intelligence agents were so successful in gathering and relaying information on German movements thanks to their position on the home front. These women in fact displayed some of the bravest manoeuvres in The Great War. Edith Cavell was a British nurse and intelligence agent who succeeded in aiding some 200 Allied soldiers escape from German occupied Belgium: for her bravery she paid with her life. SIGINT dominated intelligence gathering in order to infiltrate the enemy’s order-of-battle the “bedrock of all intelligence.” Next to combat troops SIGINT was the army’s most valuable resource. Whilst SIGINT provided the British Army with invaluable intelligence it also cancelled out much of its own effect as signals failure extensively hampered all Armies in the war. Technologies old and new were extremely unreliable and had never before been tested in such a destructive theatre of modern warfare. Artillery fire cut telephone wires making interception impossible were shot and eaten by one’s own troops. and in fact intelligence itself is never one sided: whilst you are intercepting the enemy he is intercepting you. The Germans had superior intelligence on the British order-of-battle throughout 1916 and successfully identified 70% of British units on the front during the . Records even suggest that their intelligence also warned of the times and locations of the divisional attacks that would take place on the first day of battle. Whilst Germany possessed intelligence services of equal skill to the Allies their intelligence successes could not determine them as victors of war; this is because intelligence alone does not win wars. Take again the example of the Somme and the success of the German Army in the early stages of the battle. It was not superior German intelligence that encouraged their early victory but more the tactical failures of the British Army. 66% of Allied shells fired in the first bombardment on the Somme were shrapnel and could not cut the defensive steel wire of the German front line; this hindered advancement and played a definitive role in the bloodiest day in the history of the British Army. Outside of the battlefield was where intelligence perhaps played the most important role in the war of attrition. Economic historians have emphasised that in circumstances of ‘total war’ troop numbers and supplies play the decisive role in eventual victory. Intelligence was therefore necessary to percolate into all locations and structures of war as to defeat the enemy on the home front is to allow for defeat on the battlefield. SIGINT was at the centre of some incredible intelligence feats during the war – most notably with the decryption of the Zimmermann telegram. In 1917 the Division of Naval Intelligence’s ‘Room 40’ successfully intercepted and decrypted a telegram containing German Foreign Minister Zimmermann’s suggestion that Mexico wage war on the United States (US) to regain lost territories. Britain fed this “propaganda weapon” to President Wilson knowing that outrage and the abandonment of neutrality would follow; six weeks later the US entered the war on the Allied side. The US bought with them over two million soldiers who landed in France in the final years of the war. Given the nature of attrition these men were much needed resources to fight against the diminishing manpower and morale of the German army since the beginning of August 1918 had lost 228 000 men – half through desertion. It should be noted that intelligence was not the only contributing factor to the US’ decision to enter the war – first was the in 1915 followed by the German decision to resume unrestricted submarine warfare in January 1917. Intelligence worked the most effectively in conjunction with these events to influence US movements. An Allied victory was not possible through battlefield victory alone; it was the devastating impact the collapse of the German economy had on their army that led the Allies to victory. Contributing significantly to this collapse was the work of British intelligence to influence the naval blockade of Germany. then The First Lord of the Admiralty created the Restriction of Enemy Supplies Committee (RES) in August 1914 to monitor supplies reaching Germany by collecting intelligence from various sources. HUMINT from agents infiltrating dockyards detailed exact intelligence about the types of cargo being shipped to Germany. The German blockade was especially wide reaching with the German army and her civilians beginning to feel its effects with diminishing munitions supplies Intelligence was successfully utilised throughout the Great War and had a definitive impact on its outcome. It proved to be an irreplaceable asset when the British Army adopted it alongside strategic and tactical movements. It is true that no one event decided the outcome of the war and intelligence certainly did not win the war alone but it did significantly contribute to eventual Allied victory.

The printing presses at the There was agreement that this new quandary warranted another intercolonial meeting. It was nearly ten years since the Stamp Act Congress had assembled. It was time once again for intercolonial action. Thus the First Continental Congress was convened in Philadelphia. 1765): This bill required that Colonial Authorities to furnish barracks and supplies to British troops. In 1766 it was expanded to public houses and unoccupied buildings. 1774): This bill closed the port of Boston to all colonists until the damages from the Boston Tea Party were paid for. 1774): This bill stated that British Officials could not be tried in provincial courts for capital crimes. They would be extradited back to Britain and tried there. 1774): This bill annulled the Charter of the Colonies giving the British Governor complete control of the town meetings. 1774): This bill extended the Canadian borders to cut off the western colonies of Connecticut Colonists came together at the First Continental Congress to protest the Intolerable Acts. This time participation was better. Only Georgia withheld a delegation. The representatives from each colony were often selected by almost arbitrary means as the election of such representatives was illegal. the natural leaders of the colonies managed to be selected. Sam and John Adams from Massachusetts were present as was John Dickinson from Pennsylvania. Virginia selected Richard Henry Lee and Patrick Henry. It took seven weeks for the country's future heroes to agree on a course of action. complete nonimportation was resumed. The Congress set up an organization called the Association to ensure compliance in the colonies.

One decision by the Congress often overlooked in importance is its decision to reconvene in May 1775 if their grievances were not addressed. This is a major step in creating an When Parliament chose to ignore the Congress they did indeed reconvene that next May but by this time boycotts were no longer a major issue. Unfortunately the Second Continental Congress would be grappling with choices caused by the spilling of blood at Lexington and Concord the previous month. that America came together politically for the first time on a national level and where the seeds of participatory democracy were sown.

These journals were kept by the Secretary of the Congress who was known as the ""Sam Adams"" of Philadelphia. The Journals were edited by historians at the Library of Congress in 1904 which makes understanding the motivations of the delegates much clearer. New York Call for Continental Congress In response to the Intolerable Acts the Boston Committee of Correspondence sent a circular letter throughout the colonies urging a stoppage of trade with Britain. Business-minded New Yorkers felt sympathetic toward their distressed ""sister"" colony but implied that only a continental congress could suitably handle the matter. This short primary source document reveals how and why New York decided to send delegates to a Continental Congress. Peyton Randolph of Virginia was the President of the First Continental Congress. This page contains an introductory-length bio about him from the people at Williamsburg. Resolves of the First Continental Congress It was at the First Continental Congress that America came together politically and spiritually for the first time. At Philadelphia's Carpenters' Hall they decided that each Colony would rule itself. Read the resolves that they sent to King George and Parliament. Not only was Roger Sherman a delegate to the First Continental Congress but he was the only Revolutionary to attend the Albany Conference of 1754 the 1st and 2nd Continental Congresses and the Constitutional Convention as well.

The End of the American Century This rough draft of the Declaration of Independence was handwritten by Thomas Jefferson. It is believed that it was copied from several ""creative drafts."" The changes made from draft to final form help us understand more precisely the meanings the declaration committee intended. Times had taken a sharp turn for the worse. Lexington and Concord had changed everything. When the Redcoats fired into the Boston crowd in 1775 the benefit of the doubt was granted. Now the professional imperial army was attempting to arrest patriot leaders and minutemen had been killed in their defense. In May 1775 with Redcoats once again storming Boston the Second Continental Congress convened in Philadelphia. The questions were different this time. First and foremost how would the colonist meet the military threat of the British. It was agreed that a would be created. The Congress commissioned George Washington of Virginia to be the supreme commander who chose to serve without pay. How would supplies be paid for? The Congress authorized the printing of money. Before the leaves had turned Congress had even appointed a standing committee to conduct relations with foreign governments should the need ever arise to ask for help. No longer was the Congress dealing with mere grievances. It was a full-fledged governing body. in May of 1775 the majority of delegates were not seeking independence from Britain. Only radicals like John Adams were of this mindset. In fact that July Congress approved the a direct appeal to the king. The American delegates pleaded with George III to attempt peaceful resolution and declared their loyalty to the Crown. The King refused to receive this petition and instead declared the colonies to be in a state of rebellion in August. Insult turned to injury when George ordered the hiring of mercenaries to bring the colonists under control. Americans now felt less and less like their English brethren. How could their fellow citizens order a band of ruthless foreign goons? The moderate voice in the Continental Congress was dealt a serious blow.

1620764720.2328699,58665754,https://pc.net/news/2019-10-19/returned_iphone_11_pro,"Why I Returned the iPhone 11 Pro I returned the iPhone 11 Pro to Apple and went back to my iPhone 7.  It is only the second Apple product I have returned in over 20 years of using Apple products.  The first was the I was optimistic about the 11 Pro.  I had no doubt when I preordered it that it would be an excellent replacement for my aging iPhone 7.  Plus 11 is my favorite number so I figured it was meant to be — especially after passing on the iPhone X.  But after using the 11 Pro for a week I still didn't like it. The iPhone 11 Pro is the culmination of all of Apple's latest advancements and camera technology.  Yet it still failed to impress me.  Here's what I didn't like: I ordered the regular-size iPhone 11 Pro (not the Max) and it was still too heavy.  The 6.63 ounces of the iPhone 11 Pro compared to the 4.87 ounces may not seem like a huge difference.  But it is a 36% increase in weight which makes the iPhone 11 noticeably heavier. The iPhone 11 Pro is barely bigger than the iPhone 7.  But the 0.32"" width compared to the 0.28"" width of the 7 is the difference between feeling it in my pocket and not noticing it's there.  The iPhone 11 Pro barely sticks out of some of my European skinny jeans while my iPhone 7 fits perfectly. The built-in speakers actually sound worse than the iPhone X.  The midrange has a piercing boost which I couldn't get over.  I was able to mitigate the boost by selecting the Lounge EQ in the Music app settings but that setting doesn't affect other apps like YouTube.  The improved speaker quality was one of the reasons I almost kept the iPhone X the camera.  ""The world's best camera in a smartphone"" still didn't impress me.  Even with three lenses the iPhone 11 Pro images were not noticeably better than the ones I took with my iPhone 7.  The colors were usually too saturated regardless of what settings I used.  Apple said they combine nine photos to generate the best possible image on the iPhone 11 Pro.  But a lot the images seemed overprocessed the edges of my iPhone 11 Pro felt rough.  The metal casing stuck out a little bit around the corners which would scrape my hand.  This is the first iPhone I've used where I've noticed this issue.  I checked other iPhone 11 Pros at the Apple Store and their edges were smoother.  So hopefully mine was just one of a few in a bad batch.  But instead of requesting a replacement for the iPhone 11 Pro I decided to return it and go back to my 7.  Just look at how sleek it is. they are amazed by how thin and light it is.  They act like it's from the future when it's really from 3 years in the past.  Yet newer phones.  I guess it comes down to personal preference and I've realized the size and weight of the phone is the most important thing to me. Most of my friends are happy with their iPhone 11 Pros and their mammoth iPhone 11 Pro Maxes.  And most of the reviews I've read have been positive.  So maybe there is something wrong with me and not the phone.  Then again the number 7 signifies completion so perhaps there is something special about the iPhone 7.  Still I am optimistic Apple will provide a thinner lighter phone for me and other small phone enthusiasts in the future.

Companies shifted quickly and unexpectedly to remote work in early 2020 but leaders planning for a post-pandemic future have an opportunity to take a more intentional strategic approach to remote work.  Most likely this will involve revisiting a number of 1) company policies and 2) management practices.  The authors examine key emerging trends in these areas and suggest a number of questions leaders should ask themselves as they plan for their organization’s optimal mix of remote work. Virtually all projections anticipate the post-pandemic workforce will be relatively more remote — that is nearly all firms will experience an increase in remote work relative to their pre-pandemic baseline levels. company leaders need to make decisions about how to achieve an optimal remote work strategy. Unlike the reactive shift that began abruptly in early 2020 recent PWC survey of 133 US executives nearly one-third described their approach to post-pandemic remote work as “going with the flow.” Rather than simply shifting operations “back to normal ” we urge leaders to think about how they can leverage recent remote-work experiences to intentionally plan for a remote/hybrid workforce in the future. Leaders must think strategically about their remote work policies and practices going forward. And whether you lead a company or a small team now is the time to start planning. and corporate advisory experience suggests that the key decisions leaders will face fall into two main categories: company policies and management practices. Below we take a look at key emerging trends in each of these categories. A proactive implementation of remote work may require updating company policies to fit the needs of a dispersed workforce. As companies reconsider existing policies they’ll need to address the following questions. What’s the right mix of remote work for your organization? Possible scenarios include a primarily remote hybrid (with employees in the office part-time typically two or three days per week) or a primarily in-office setting. To determine the optimal policy for your organization leaders should factor in the following strategic considerations: Independent tasks — that do not rely heavily on collaboration or coordination with others — are ideal for remote work. Highly collaborative work can also be successful remotely some jobs simply cannot be performed remotely but these may be fewer than you think. Companies continue to stretch the boundaries of remote work New employees or those recently promoted typically benefit from an initial period of time in the office both to build relationships and to gain the implicit knowledge that can be more easily absorbed in the office environment. If the workforce is primarily remote synchronous virtual orientation sessions or on-site retreats may be beneficial. Individual choices should be taken into consideration given differences in for remote work. Although some employees may indicate preferences now as work patterns and routines normalize. Real estate costs and carbon footprint. Less may be more to position for sustainability or scalable growth. Are you ready to consider a work from anywhere (WFA) policy? This would enable employees to live anywhere they wish (typically within a defined region such as the United States as long as they are able to productively perform their work for the company. Early research on WFA suggests that granting geographic flexibility enables employees to pursue bigger life goals related to “residential satisfaction Strategic considerations for WFA include the potential for an increased talent pool of highly sought-after employees. Company leadership also needs to decide how best to in a WFA environment while managing challenges related to scheduling and task coordination. State-specific are also likely to evolve depending on the number of employees and roles performed while working from home. How can you maintain a strong company culture? culture may need to be reinforced or refined as work transitions to more remote/hybrid models. Spreading knowledge of the norms and assumptions important to the organization in a virtual environment include town halls and special lunches to build shared experiences pulse check surveys to check whether shared values are coming across to employees and intentional communications about programs and initiatives important to the organization. Which HR policies will need to be updated? Companies considering fully remote or hybrid work may need to change a variety of human resource policies and practices: Recruiting strategies may need to focus on new or different skills and competencies such as adjusting salaries for working from home and scaling pay relative to geographic offices are important to consider. One indicated that around 44% of employees would be willing to reduce their pay by 10% to work remotely forever. Some companies such as have announced they will adjust the pay of employees who choose to move away from their headquarters to areas with lower costs of living. Benefit programs may be adapted to reflect the to more remote options. For example one of our corporate contacts has begun receiving a company-provided Peleton subscription as a substitute for a previous gym-membership benefit. What kinds of new training will need to be offered? Companies are increasingly realizing that training in the social and relational aspects of remote work is at least as important as training in technology and company policies. Results from a recent show that 64% of executives plan to invest in training leaders to manage a more virtual workforce. Our only 30% of companies trained employees in virtual work skills and that training overwhelmingly focused on software technology and company policies. We recommend that companies provide training on skills known to enhance remote work and incorporating social elements into virtual work relationships. For example where ideas are given and responses provided quickly can be provided as these communication bursts have been shown to generate greater productivity and better remote team outcomes. In addition will be valuable in maintaining equity between remote and on-site employees. organizations should consider adapting management practices and behaviors to a remote or hybrid work environment. Here are a few questions that managers should think about as part of the transition to a longer-term remote workforce: How can you foster a healthy remote-work climate? One of the most important aspects of managing a remote or hybrid workforce in the long run will be establishing an organizational climate that is encouraging and positive for remote workers. ( and refers to the perceptions employees have about their work environment.) One effective tool is a leader-supported declaration of organizational expectations related to remote work. For example in the early days of the pandemic IBM employees created a “work-from-home pledge” that specified company norms such as how to communicate and treat each other while working remotely. This grassroots initiative was ultimately which provided a strong signal to the rest of the organization about accepted remote-work norms. Similar leader-led supportive statements and behaviors can have significant impact on the remote-work climate that evolves post-pandemic. How can you help employees manage competing work and life priorities? In a remote or hybrid work environment leaders have the opportunity to help employees enact models to effectively manage work and life. Sometimes this involves demonstrating that the goal may not be to find a perfect balance but more of a work-life rhythm that works best for them. cues on how to do this that leaders can help employees establish and maintain having a dedicated work space) finding the optimal time to work) when is it okay for colleagues to reach out) individual preferences for integrating or segmenting work) faking a commute through a walk or stationary bike ride) How can you create a sense of psychological safety? Research has demonstrated that high-performing teams have a sense of psychological safety where employees feel they can speak up and offer ideas without being punished or ostracized. Psychological safety is valuable in the remote work environment and can be increased when managers: Ask questions (such as checking in on employees to see how they are doing) such as when you accidentally used a Invite participation from all team members (asking “What do you think? What’s your perception of this? What are we missing?)” Encourage risk (letting employees try out new ideas How can you consciously engage employees? Research indicates that even small amounts of such as those demonstrating compassion or concern can lower stress and improve well-being. Repeated occurences of these throughout the day can provide a mitigating the feelings of isolation often associated with remote work. of remote colleagues indicated that a predictable communication cadence fosters productive and trusting working relationships. Managers can build cadence among employees by using meetings as opportunities for employees to connect socially and foster personalized relationships through sharing songs leaders can establish practices for team collaboration. for dispersed and digital teams promotes a common identity and common understanding. This can be developed by setting team goals providing a shared information context and clarifying the purpose of the team similar to team development in s. Events to proactively connect in-office and remote workers should be maintained as well going forward such as virtual coffee chats and remote office hours. How can you nurture employee trust and accountability? After the Covid-19 crisis has passed managers may need to find ways to among remote teams on a longer-term basis. Because it is more difficult to know and understand employee actions and motivations in remote work establishing competence and interpersonal trust can be challenging. Managers can invest in technology to set and update goals and objectives related to desired outcomes and generate feedback on those objectives. For example General Electric (GE) replaced a performance management system with a coaching app called to provide real-time information and feedback to employees. Managers set up touch points throughout the year to build accountability and help employees develop professionally. Importantly these types of technologies are not used to monitor employee presence but to provide opportunities to share information and guide employees. As we return to pre-pandemic workplaces strategic decisions about whether or how to develop a remote and hybrid work come to the forefront. With intentional planning organizations can proactively consider company policies and management practices to transform their remote workforce.  Now is the time to reflect on how much you and your employees have learned over the past year and use your new knowledge and experience to create your own optimal workplace of the future. is an associate professor of management at the University of Akron’s College of Business Administration. is executive professor of management and director of partnerships at Northeastern’s D’Amore-McKim School of Business.

After describing the new Mac Pro and display the speaker announced the pricing.  After shocking the audience with a five-thousand dollar price tag for the Apple monitor he said the stand will be $999. There was an audible gasp from the audience.  No it was definitely more of a groan.  The groan was so loud that it completely deflated the excitement about everything Apple had just announced.  What a sad moment for pro users after we have waited over five years for a new Mac Pro and new displays. 000 is not unreasonable for the new ultra-powerful Mac Pro though I would have liked to see a sub-$5 000 entry point for users who just need the basic modular .

Heavy Medal: A Mock Newbery Blog Heavy Medal: A Mock Newbery Blog Unbury the Past: Apps and Websites for Exploring Ancient Worlds | Mix It Up Perhaps the most famous quote on history comes from the late Harvard professor and writer George Santayana: “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” Without familiarity with ancient histories students lack the fundamental knowledge that enables a greater understanding of the world today. Kids might be aware of the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece and Egypt but do they know about Mesopotamia or the importance of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers? The following apps and websites help present old information through a new lens and may just pique students’ interest in an ancient culture or civilization. We hope you’ll add these resources to your teaching toolbox share them with fellow educators and help your students and patrons unearth the past. like some facts of ancient history can sometimes fade away into obsolescence before we truly come to know and appreciate them. That’s not the case below. Here are some of the best and most regularly used websites in our libraries. The AHE cites itself as a small nonprofit dedicated to providing high-quality history content to enthusiasts and students for free. Students can explore topics using a time line and natural language searches. The site is well designed and organized and contains information in many formats—videos National Geographic’s Ancient World News (AWN) Part of the greater National Geographic site AWN is of the quality one would expect from NatGeo. Highlighting contemporary news concerning discoveries about the ancient world and ancient artifacts this site connects current events with ancient history. Some recent examples include the destruction of ancient sites by ISIS an in-depth look at the life of Bronze Age women and the Shroud of Turin. Since AWN is a part of the larger NatGeo site natural language searches aren’t as fruitful as on a dedicated site. Truly an online version of a textbook the site features information about major aspects of prehistoric world and takes readers through Egypt and South and Central America. Accessible language is used to describe the time periods and major events; sidebars contain links that lead to external websites on the topic. While some of these links may be broken from time to time they do provide additional information on most subjects. Billed as a pop archaeology site Ancient Origins strives to provide the latest research as well as alternative views regarding science and history. The “Ancient Places” tab is arranged geographically and highlights structures and sites with cultural significance. Teens will be intrigued by the legends and unexplained phenomena explored around cultures and artifacts. Because of the alternative nature of some of the information this site is best explored by students who have some knowledge of the topic at hand. Perhaps the most important document for understanding the pre-Columbian history of Mexico the Codex Mendoza is an incredibly important primary source from the ancient Aztecs that documents Mexico’s history up until the arrival of Spaniards in about 1541. For older students who have the patience to sift through an extraordinary amount of information—and some incredible images—look no further than this unique resource. Type “ancient history” into Apple’s app store and be amazed at the sheer volume of seemingly flashy—but uninteresting—options. We separate the wheat from the chaff with this list of favorites.

The app includes a slew of facts about Horesnakht’s life and death including photos of her mummified body—wrapped and unwrapped. Photos of her body being transported and examined and the resulting CT scans are included but perhaps the most compelling illustrations are the facial reconstruction images. Essentially an interactive textbook on Egyptian history is a rich resource with detailed information. The app includes sections on hieroglyphics and an interesting section on everyday life. The app even has a few games that will appeal to users seeking a history-themed break from what can become monotonous reading in some of the other sections.

1620764777.157782,11492937,https://pc.net/news/2019-05-25/free_wi-fi_japan_2019,"I finally made it back to Japan last month five years after my first visit.  I say ""finally"" since I had hoped to return much sooner.  Japan happens to be my favorite place in the world. A lot can change in five years technology.  When I visited Japan in 2014 to find free Wi-Fi.  Fortunately data plan from AT&T before leaving for my 2014 trip.  This was my lifeline as traveled up north where English signs disappeared and most people only spoke Japanese. situation was completely different.  I was able to find free Wi-Fi in nearly every city I visited and Kyoto.  I even found several places with free Wi-Fi in Iwaki located 2.5 hours north of Tokyo in the Fukushima prefecture. Most coffee shops in Japan now have Wi-Fi.  If they don't offer an open network they typically display the Wi-Fi prominently at the front counter.  Last time it seemed like most coffee shops tried to hide the password.  Most restaurants in Japan also provide free Wi-Fi but they often require a password typically displayed at the reception. Nearly every train station in Japan now has an open Wi-Fi network which is completely different than five years ago.  Onboard Wi-Fi is available on most trains including the Shinkansen.  For some reason I was rarely able to connect successfully.  I'm not sure if it had to do with my US-based or if it was simply because the trains were moving so fast. While free Wi-Fi is now more prevalent in Japan the irony is I didn't need it most of the time.  Instead of the measly 120 MB of data I had available last trip this time I had unlimited data.  The day before I left I signed up for AT&T's International Day Pass which provides unlimited data and voice calling for $10/day.  The Day Pass is a solid alternative to the $60 one plan or the $120 three gigabyte plan at least for trips that are two weeks or less.  For example if you think you might use more than one gig of data you'll need to spend $120 for the 3 GB plan.  That's the same as using unlimited data for 12 days.  And if you don't need cellular data – at a hotel for example – you can turn off data roaming and avoid the $10 charge.  Below is a list of the International Day Pass charges from my trip.  Notice a few days are missing from when I turned off data roaming. The only problem with the International Day Pass is that the $10 charges can be annoyingly inefficient.  For example if you send one standard text message or make one phone call turn on data roaming for a few seconds you'll be charged $10 for that 24-hour period.  If you want to be extra efficient you can turn off data roaming right before the 24-hour period resets.  Then turn it back on whenever you need it possibly saving one or two days worth of charges during your trip.  But is it really worth the hassle?  Probably not. If you're planning a trip to Japan you'll be happy to know that free Wi-Fi is easy to find.  Still I recommend signing up for an international data plan with your mobile carrier before you leave.  For a small fee you'll be able to access the Internet on your phone almost anywhere you travel.  It's worth the cost both for the convenience and the peace of mind.

While Mac users were happy to see updated iMacs even the most loyal Apple customers were left wondering — will there ever be a new design? The ""computer-on-a-stand"" design has remained relatively unchanged since Apple released the iMac G5 in 2004.  Despite growing complaints from Apple users Apple has not strayed from the iPod-inspired design of the early 2000s.  Finally after more than a decade information has surfaced as to why the company has been so reticent to update the design. It turns out Apple accidentally ordered too many aluminum iMac stands — 999 000 to be exact.  The employee who was tasked with placing the 2004 order for aluminum iMac stands accidentally typed ""one billion"" instead of ""one million.""  ( now corrects the common misspellings to ""million"" instead of ""billion."")  Somehow no one caught the error before the order was processed by the Chinese aluminum company. ""It was a pretty big problem.  There was no way out of the purchase agreement once the order was placed "" said a former Apple who worked in the iMac division.  ""We didn't even realize the error until several million stands were delivered to the factory.  That's when we got concerned."" Apple's management team held an emergency meeting to find a solution.  They built a 10-year roadmap of iMacs that would all use the same aluminum stand.  They also designed new that would incorporate the L-shaped stands.  While it was a creative solution Apple still only used about four million stands per year.  After two and a half years Instead of letting the stands go to waste Apple decided to ""recycle"" the unused stands melting them down and turning them PowerBooks and Power Macs and eventually MacBooks and Mac Pros.  But after three years Apple had still used less than 5% of the aluminum stands they had ordered.  In 2007 Apple built aluminum into the original and made the entire iMac aluminum Yet even as Mac sales increased the problem remained.  Ten years later Apple still had not used up even half of the aluminum stands.  Therefore instead of releasing a new Mac Pro in 2017 Apple decided to make an ""iMac Pro"" that would use more aluminum.  The company built another version of the iMac and just painted it black.  As of April 1 929 days since Apple last updated the Mac Pro. "" said another unnamed source at Apple's iMac division.  ""We used to be the leader in hardware design.  But then we ordered all those dang aluminum stands...""  While Apple's operations division approved melting down the aluminum for other products they have remained firm in using the existing stands for iMacs.  The result is that that iMac design has remained unchanged for 15 years despite numerous complaints.  A few examples include: The components overheat since they are so close to the screen. The internal fans spin up too often. There is not sufficient room for a high-end graphics card. It is difficult to repair or service. The ports in the back are difficult to reach. The height of the display is not adjustable. A recent poll revealed more than 90% of iMac users have a book or some type of shoebox underneath their iMac. 15 years after the fateful typo Apple has now used roughly half of the iMac stands they ordered.  The bad news is that with 500 million stands still in the warehouse Apple's hardware design may stall for another decade.

1620764803.644283,54779280,https://hbr.org/2021/01/9-trends-that-will-shape-work-in-2021-and-beyond,Don’t expect the pace of change to slow down. While 2020 was the most volatile year in modern history it would be a mistake to think that we’re in for smoother sailing this year. In fact as we move into 2021 and beyond the rate of disruption will potentially accelerate as the implications from 2020 play out across the next several years. Here are nine predictions from the chief of research for Gartner’s HR practice. It’s fair to say that 2020 rocked many organizations and business models upending priorities and plans as business leaders scrambled to navigate a rapidly changing environment. For many organizations this included responding to the social justice movements shifting to a full-time remote staff determining how best to support employees’ wellbeing and now addressing legal concerns around the Covid-19 vaccine. It would be nice to believe that 2021 will be about stability and getting back to normal; however this year is likely to be another full of major transitions. While there has been a lot of focus on the increase in the number of employees working remotely at least part of the time going forward there are nine additional forces that I think will shape business in 2021: 1. Employers will shift from managing the employee experience to managing the life experience of their employees . The pandemic has given business leaders increased visibility into the personal lives of their employees who have faced unprecedented personal and professional struggles over the last year. It’s become clear that supporting employees in their personal lives more effectively enables employees to not only have better lives but also to perform at a higher level. According to employers that support employees with their life experience see a 23% increase in the number of employees reporting better mental health and a 17% increase in the number of employees reporting better physical health. There is also a real benefit to employers who see a 21% increase in the number of high performers compared to organizations that don’t provide the same degree of support to their employees. That’s why 2021 will be the year where employer support for mental health and even things that were previously seen as out of bounds will become the table stakes benefits offered to employees. 2. More companies will adopt stances on current societal and political debates. Employees’ desire to work for organizations whose values align with their own has been growing for some time. In 2020 shows that 74% of employees expect their employer to become more in the cultural debates of the day. I believe CEOs will have to respond in order to retain and attract the best talent. making statements about the issues of the day is no longer enough: Employees expect more. And CEOs who have spent real resources on these issues have been rewarded with more highly engaged employees. found that the number of employees who were considered highly engaged increased from 40% to 60% when their organization acted on today’s social issues. 3. The gender-wage gap will continue to increase as employees return to the office. Many organizations have already adopted a hybrid workforce — or are planning to this year — that enables employees to work from the corporate office or an alternate third space (coffee shop etc.). In this hybrid scenario we are hearing from CHROs that the surveys of their own employees are showing that men are more likely to decide to return to their workplace while women are more likely to continue to work from home. 64% of managers believe that office workers are higher performers than remote workers and in turn are likely to give in-office workers a higher raise than those who work from home. However that we have collected from both 2019 (pre-pandemic) and 2020 (during the pandemic) shows the opposite: Full-time remote workers are 5% more likely to be high performers than those who work full-time from the office. So if men are more likely to work from the office and managers retain a bias towards in-office workers we should expect to see managers over-rewarding male employees at the expense of female employees worsening the gender-wage gap at a time when the pandemic has already had 4. New regulations will limit employee monitoring. more than 1 out of 4 companies has purchased new technology to passively track and monitor their employees. However many of these same companies haven’t determined how to balance employee privacy with the technology found that less than 50% of employees trust their organization with their data and 44% don’t receive any information regarding the data collected about them. In 2021 we expect a variety of new regulations at the state and local level that will start to put limits on what employers can track about their employees. Given the variability that this will create companies are likely to adopt the most restrictive standards across their workforce. 5. Flexibility will shift from location to time. While enabling employees to work remotely became commonplace across 2020 (and will continue this year and beyond) the next wave of flexibility will be around revealed that only 36% of employees were high performers at organizations with a standard 40-hour work week. Organizations that offer employees flexibility over when where and how much they work see 55% of their work force as high performers. In 2021 I expect to see a rise of new jobs where employees will be measured by their output as opposed to an agreed-upon set of hours. 6. Leading companies will make bulk purchases of the Covid vaccine for employees — and will be sued over Covid vaccine requirements. Employers that provide the Covid vaccine to their workforce will leverage this action as a key differentiator to attract and retain talent. In tandem with employers providing the vaccine several companies will be sued for requiring their employees to have proof of vaccination before allowing them to return to the workplace. The corresponding litigation will slow return-to-workplace efforts even as vaccine usage increases. 7. Mental health support is the new normal. employers have offered new benefits to support their employees expanded parental leave. Even before the pandemic revealed that 45% of well-being budget increases were being allocated to mental and emotional well-being programs. The Covid-19 pandemic has brought well-being to the forefront as employers are more aware than ever how of the impact of mental health on employees and by association 68% of organizations had introduced at least one new wellness benefit to aid employees during the pandemic. In 2021 employers will go even further by working to de-stigmatize mental health by expanding mental health benefits creating days where they shut the entire company down for a day to offer “a collective mental health day” to build awareness across the workforce about this critical issue. 8. Employers will look to “rent” talent to fill the skills gap. The number of skills employers are looking for has risen dramatically — shows that companies listed about 33% more skills on job ads in 2020 than they did in 2017. Ultimately organizations simply can’t reskill the capabilities of their existing workforce fast enough to meet their changing needs. some companies will shift from trying to build skills for an uncertain future and instead just hire and pay a premium for those skills when the need actually manifests. Other companies will instead expand their use of contingent and contract hiring or expand their partnerships with organizations to “rent” employees for a short period of time to meet the skill needs that they are facing. 9. States will compete to attract individual talent rather than trying to get companies to relocate. States and cities have historically offered incentives to get companies to relocate to their jurisdictions. The belief being if you can incentivize companies to come they will bring jobs with them. The new era of remote and hybrid work will evolve this strategy – where an employee lives will be less tied to where their employer is located than ever before. Given this breaking of company location and employee location states and cities will start to use their tax policies to create incentives for individuals to relocate to their jurisdictions rather than giving tax credits solely to large companies to relocate.  We are already seeing fledging programs in cities like Topeka OK where they are offering remote employees up to $15 000 to move there. These jurisdictions will compete for individual employees and their jobs While 2020 was the most volatile year in modern history we would be mistaken to think that the disruption is over. Rather as we move into 2021 and beyond the rate of disruption will potentially accelerate as the implications from 2020 play out across the next several years. is chief of research for the Gartner HR practice which delivers insights and solutions that address new and emerging executive challenges and enable HR leaders to take decisive actions.

1620764803.873877,88679294,https://newpol.org/review/helen-kellers-socialism/,"(New Politics Vol. XVIII No. 2 “The seeds of socialism are being scattered far and wide and the power does not exist in the world which can prevent their germination.” “There is a pertinence and connection between [Helen’s politics and] our current historical moment (even one hundred years later). She has a lot of things to say to us. … She had belief in the power of the young to move us a few steps closer to the kind of world we’d like to live in. So I hope this film speaks to new generations of activists and gives them some nutrition for the good fight.” Q & A with the director A director would normally balk at the prospect of making a movie about an historical subject on whom there is an extreme dearth of extant audio or visual material. In fact director John Gianvito did precisely that twenty years ago when he first began exploring the possibility of making a movie on the under-appreciated socialist politics of Helen Keller. Gianvito had originally discovered Keller’s radical political history within the writings of the influential “people’s historian about whom Gianvito would later make an award-winning documentary ( Profit Motive and the Whispering Mind the primary medium by which Keller (who was blind and deaf) communicated her voluminous thoughts was that of the written rather than aural or visual word. Additionally much of Keller’s personal archive of photographic and recorded content was destroyed over the years in a series of tragedies (a house fire in 1946 and the destruction of the World Trade Center in 2001). Gianvito decided to revisit the project. The renewed popularity of socialist ideas following the 2008 global crisis of financial capitalism the rise of the Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter movements the historic campaigns of Bernie Sanders within the Democratic Party primaries and the meteoric growth of Democratic Socialists of America—all these signs pointed to a revivified relevance of socialism in the United States. Gianvito adopted a different conception of the Keller vehicle. The scarcity of primary audio and visual source material was inescapable Gianvito recognized; but perhaps this was quite metaphorically fitting for a subject who made use of neither the sense of sight nor sound. which recently received a limited run through the 58th New York Film Festival (held entirely online this year due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic). The 1 hour 33 minute movie is an interesting bricolage of white text against a black background; an eclectic selection of thematic music; scenes of nature in states of change and at rest; topical clips from newsreel and other secondary historical sources; professional narration and voice acting performed by Carolyn Forché; and the rare gem offering firsthand recordings and photographs of Keller speaking All of this makes the documentary appear as an unlikely combination of worlds. With its text-on-screen format overlaid by musical and narrative accompaniment one experiences the anachronistic universe of silent film; its interspersed shots of icicles melting in springtime or a slug making a herculean pilgrimage across the face of a boulder strike one as eminently modernist in form. This latter aspect of the movie may not be quite so eagerly met by those whose primary attraction to the title stems from a desire to learn more about Keller’s socialist thought. There are odd stretches of long minutes in which on-screen bees pollinate flowers and flies buzz around an animal carcass. There is also an odd exception to form when the viewer is presented with the lone instance of political analysis not by an interviewee discussing Keller’s politics the various U.S. social movements of which she was a part or the complexities of disability political theory in Keller’s time and now. Rather the movie is given over to a four-minute clip of Noam Chomsky speaking at an event in 1989 on the ideological repercussions of the Cold War and the differences between the “opportunistic … Leninism” of the 1917 Bolshevik “coup” in Russia (an event which Keller viewed as a revolutionary beacon of socialist hope to the world) and the “mainstream Marxist movement” represented by the German Social-Democratic Party and the likes of Anton Pannekoek. leaving aside questions of appropriate analyses of the social nature of Russia over the seventy-plus years between workers’ revolution and “the fall of Communism ” the central political content of is both inspiring and edifying. Keller lived during the tumultuous years spanning 1880 to 1968; she identified as a socialist for sixty of those years and was heavily involved in all of the major socialist and radical movements and organizations in the United States for roughly fifteen of those years beginning in 1908 when she joined the Socialist Party. Throughout this period she participated in protests for women’s equality and Black freedom. She organized in solidarity with workers strikes and anti-imperialist initiatives. She toured and gave speeches on behalf of the Socialist Party of America and the Industrial Workers of the World. She offered her prestige to movements affiliated with the American Communist Party. She supported the struggle against nuclear weapons and the anti-communism of Cold War McCarthyism. She wrote prolifically on the topic of social revolution the injuries of economic inequality the violence and opposition to democracy of the capitalist class the oppression of the disabled and the economically marginalized and the hope of a society reimagined around the principle that “the welfare of each is bound up with the welfare of all.” Gianvito provides us with a taste of this all—a taste of Keller’s political genius. There are certainly elements of the documentary that are wanting. For instance Gianvito inexplicably leaves out any discussion of Keller’s association with the anti-colonial movements of the 1940s and 1950s; the concomitant Non-Aligned Movement such as Jawaharlal Nehru and Josip Tito drew the keen interest of Keller; or the affection with which Keller regarded Henry Wallace’s 1948 Progressive Party campaign for U.S. president. Further Gianvito’s documentary does not include any analysis of the politics of disability which were of course integral to Keller’s lifework. is a welcome contribution to the contemporary proliferation of socialist-educational materials. If the movie does nothing more than whet the audience’s appetite for more of Keller’s politics then it can be considered a great success.

[MMB] Comment on or rate this resource Neural Neighbors: Pictorial Tropes in the Meserve-Kunhardt Collection The Yale Digital Humanities Lab presents Neural Neighbors a project intended to enable users to ""identify visual similarity at scale across collections of photographs and videos."" Currently the project uses a subset selected from the Beinecke Library's Meserve-Kunhardt Collection which was assembled by Frederick Hill Meserve who collected photographs between 1897 and his death in 1962. This large collection documents United States history especially the American Civil War and also includes portraits of some 6 500 individuals such as Abraham Lincoln U.S. and Confederate military and governmental personnel and other entertainers. When Neural Neighbors loads viewers first see a screen full of images. Mousing over any image brings up additional visually related images. For example familiar-looking portrait of Lincoln in a seated position is associated with similarly posed portraits of (among others) George Armstrong Halsey (1827-1894) and P. T. Barnum (1810-1891). The experimental nature of the project is revealed at this point because it's not possible to retrieve more information about the images without leaving Neural Neighbors and searching Yale's collections which can be a frustrating exercise.

Alternately users may also opt not to use any cloud service to synchronize data instead keeping their devices synchronized over local Wi-Fi or even just using a USB stick. No matter how password data is (or isn't) synchronized Enpass keeps passwords secure using industry-standard AES-256 encryption. Additionally Enpass includes a password generator. The Enpass desktop application is available for free on Windows and Linux.

Asp - or ash? Climate historians link Cleopatra's demise to volcanic eruption Volcanos Helped Violent Revolts Erupt in Ancient Egypt Volcanic Eruptions May Have Doomed an Ancient Egyptian Dynasty Volcanic suppression of Nile summer flooding triggers revolt and constrains interstate conflict in ancient Egypt The fall of Egypt's Ptolemaic Kingdom in 30 BCE marked by the death of Cleopatra VII has been the subject of art and film in addition to historical studies. On Tuesday a new study published in suggests that volcanic eruptions may have played a role in this historic event. The study was authored by by an interdisciplinary team of historians and climate scientists including Joseph Manning a historian of ancient Egypt and Greece a climate historian. By examining ice cores in Greenland and Antarctica the team determined that there were likely several large volcanic eruptions in the years preceding the demise of Cleopatra's Egypt including a large volcanic eruption in 46 and 44 BCE. When volcanoes erupt which forms aerosols that block sunlight and inhibit evaporation. This phenomenon prevents rainfall and monsoons may have prevented the Nile River from flooding and caused a famine. In fact Egyptian records from this time period confirm the presence of famine and social unrest during these years. In addition to researching ice cores and ancient Egyptian documents the research team also examined records from the Nilometer (a record of Nile water levels kept in Ancient Egypt) to piece together this new hypothesis. Collectively the researchers believe that these factors offer new insight into the demise of the Ptolemaic Kingdom.

Those who want to read the original research paper in full may do so via the fourth link. Next the fifth link takes readers to a video created by which provides a lucid explanation of how volcanoes can impact global climate. The video uses the example devastating 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora which caused famine in India and ""the year without a summer"" in Europe. Finally the last link takes readers to an essay about the far-reaching effects of the August 1883 volcanic explosion of Krakatoa in Indonesia. This essay centers around letters penned by poet Gerald Manley Hopkins to about the strangely colorful sunsets that followed the volcano's eruption.

I've learned a lot in the past 20 years.  While my early years investing were pretty painful I eventually developed a strategy that has worked well.  Several of my friends ask me for investment advice which I'm happy to provide with the qualifier that nothing is guaranteed when it comes to the stock market.

Recently I've enjoyed making a stock pick at the beginning of each year.  I choose a single stock that I think will do well in the next 12 months.  Last year I chose AMD.  It started the year at 10.98 and hit a high of 34.14 in September for a gain of 311%.  Like a lot of high-flying tech stocks AMD came back to earth in the last quarter of 2018 but it still finished at 18.46 I've decided to share my annual stock pick on PC.net.  For 2019 ).  If you're not familiar with Western Digital its primary business is producing data storage devices WDC has fallen a lot over the past few months.  The stock is heavily oversold demand has fallen and prices of I see a lot of upside for Western Digital this year.  Enterprise storage investment is still increasing at a rapid rate and flash storage (NAND) pricing is cyclical and will eventually recover. which gives the company a low P/E ratio of 5.21 and a nice dividend yield of 5.41%.  Those numbers combined with the potential upside and limited downside over the next 12 months makes the risk/reward of WDC the best of any stock I can think of right now.

So there you have it: my 2019 stock pick is WDC.  While it's currently trading at a historically low price of 36.97 I wouldn't mind if it dropped a little further so I can buy more shares at an even better price.  I'm guessing that by the end of 2019 the price of WDC will be significantly higher. This article is an opinion and should not be considered professional investment advice.  No matter whose advice you decide to listen to remember: nothing in the stock market is guaranteed.

And it will leave a structural macroeconomic legacy if economies don’t return fully to their old growth trajectory or rates. But it’s a long way from a macroeconomic shock — even a severe one — to a structural regime break such as a depression or a debt crisis. The authors map four paths that lead to a structural regime break using historical examples to illustrate each and explain why they believe each scenario is unlikely for the U.S. right now. Understanding the Economic Shock of the Covid-19 Crisis a number of our coronavirus articles To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox There is no doubt that the coronavirus is driving a macroeconomic meltdown around the world. In the U.S. and elsewhere heavy job losses will likely drive unemployment figures to levels not seen since the Great Depression. Fiscal efforts to contain the crisis are pushing deficits to levels last seen during World War II. Both developments have spurred fears and commentary that the crisis is spiraling into either a depression or a debt crisis. But is it too soon for such pessimism? The intensity of this shock isn’t in question — the depth and speed of the fall in output is unparalleled and frightening. And coronavirus will also leave a structural macroeconomic legacy if economies don’t return fully to their old growth trajectory or rates . But it’s a long way from a macroeconomic shock — even a severe one — to a structural regime break such as a depression or a debt crisis. Price stability is the parameter to watch — it’s the key to a favorable macroeconomic regime. A break such as a depression or a debt crisis is marked by a shift to extreme deflation or inflation and thus a breakdown of the normal functioning of the economy. Over the last 30 years the U.S. economy has enjoyed falling has driven low interest rates and high asset valuations. But if price stability falters there would be massive consequences for the real and financial economies. how worried should we be? The Four Paths to a Structural Regime Break Policy and politics are what stand between a severe crisis and a structural regime break. Persistently inadequate policy responses — rooted either in an inability or a political unwillingness — are what fail to stop the negative trajectory of a crisis-ridden economy. We’ve mapped four paths that lead to a structural regime break using historical examples to illustrate each. The first path to a depression occurs when politicians and policymakers conceptually struggle to diagnose and remedy the problem. The Great Depression is a classic example — it was an epic policy failure which facilitated not only the depth of the crisis but also its length and legacy. Two conceptual misunderstandings were involved: Monetary policy error and banking crisis : Limited oversight of the banking system and bank runs resulted in thousands of bank failures and enormous losses to depositors between 1929 and 1933. The collapsing banking system crippled the flow of credit to firms and households. Even though the Federal Reserve was created in 1913 ostensibly to fight such crises it stood by as the banking system collapsed believing that monetary policy was on easy footing. In reality it was stuck in a conceptual error. : Politicians also stood by and watched the economy bleed out for much too long. The New Deal came too late to prevent the depression and it was too little to reverse its impact. And when fiscal policy tightened again in 1937-38 the economy collapsed again. Eventually World War II decisively ended the Great Depression by massively boosting aggregate demand and even returning economic output to its pre-depression trend. The result of these policy mistakes was severe deflation (collapse in the price level) by well over 20%. This meant that while unemployment was at very high levels the nominal value of many assets fell sharply while the real burden of most debts rose sharply — leaving household and firms struggling to regain their footing. The second path from a deep crisis to a depression happens when the economic diagnosis is clear and the remedies are known but politicians stand in the path of solution. It’s a problem of willingness more than understanding and mindsets. we don’t have to look far: A lack of political will drove the U.S. economy dangerously close to a deflationary depression in 2008 when the U.S. Congress could not agree on a path forward in the global financial crisis. bank capital losses were piling up leading to a credit crunch that was crippling the economy. With a rickety banking system the risk of a path to a deflationary depression was real — as underlined by collapsing inflation expectations in the depth of the crisis. The most dangerous moment came on Sept. 29 when the House of Representatives voted down TARP the $700 billion rescue package to recapitalize (or bail out) banks. The ensuing market collapse helped change the political price of standing in TARP’s way and a few days later political willingness came together in the last minute to prevent a structural regime break and contained the structural legacy to a U-shaped shock. While the U.S. economy regained its growth it never found its way back to pre-crisis growth which is the definition of a A third potential path from severe crisis to a depression is when policy makers do not have the operational autonomy or fiscal resources to act. This happens in countries or territories that lack monetary sovereignty or central bank autonomy — in other words in times of crisis they can’t use the central bank to ensure a healthy flow of credit even if their currency is stable. Internal depression — price and wage deflation — is the only way for such economies to rebalance and satisfy the constraints of monetary dependence. Perhaps the best example of such dependence is Greece’s relationship with the European Central Bank in the context of the global financial crisis. Unable to use the ECB for access to financing Greece had to enter a depression that came with severe deflationary pressures. The fourth path differs from the previous three in that it leads to a debt crisis rather than a depression. In this case policy makers know what to do yet they can’t raise the real resources to do anything as the markets reject their actions. This is distinct from the other three paths in that instead of deflation it leads to high inflation. Think Argentina at various points in time the Asian financial crisis of 1997 the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s Weimar Germany: In all of these instances policy makers were unable to raise the real resources to finance their spending because debt and currency markets reject it. When looking at debt crisis risks commentators too often are preoccupied with debt but this is a misunderstanding of debt crises. They happen — and do not happen — at all levels of debt-to-GDP. Other factors negative risk-rate correlations (when risk goes up global demand for the currency in question as well as the difference between nominal interest and growth rates all influence an economy’s ability to finance itself more than the debt-to-GDP ratio. Why the U.S. Is Unlikely to be Headed Towards a Structural Regime Break Though the path from the crisis we’re in now to either depression or debt crisis is not impossible it’s not easy or natural if we examine each of the four paths in regards to the current situation: — The policy challenge of coronavirus is enormous but what is on display is the opposite of the inaction of the Great Depression. On the monetary side the first signs of stress in the banking system — in the repo and commercial paper markets — were met with timely and sizable monetary policy action. On the fiscal side it didn’t take long — certainly by Washington standards — to pass the $2 trillion CARES Act to provide funds to counteract the wave of liquidity and capital problems for the real economy (households and firms). Beyond any specific policy action we are seeing a mindset in which policy makers will keep throwing policy innovations at the problem until something sticks — quite the opposite of the 1930s. — It certainly is possible that political calculus gets in the way of averting a structural breakdown but not very plausible because the political costs are high. To be sure there are two risks involved: 1) The unwillingness to perhaps because of differences in analysis or dogma; and 2) the failure to legislation because one side sees greater political gain in obstruction. While the TARP fiasco reminds us that both risks are real and shouldn’t be dismissed crises tend to lubricate deal making and the costs of political obstruction are particularly high even in a hyper-partisan election year. — This path is not applicable in the U.S. because of monetary sovereignty. The Federal Reserve will always facilitate fiscal policy in a time of low and stable inflation and a healthy currency. — A debt crisis seems improbable for the U.S.: Inflation expectations are very well anchored (and too low). The rate-risk correlation is very solid where in risk-off periods (moment when investors are less tolerant of risk and prices of risk assets like stocks fall) bond prices rally (yields fall). The USD reserve currency status is deeply entrenched as the rest of the world needs to hold U.S. safe assets (and don’t wish to see their currencies appreciate). And nominal interest rates are generally lower than nominal growth (r – g < 0). All of these factors make for favorable financing conditions. Can coronavirus damage all that and deliver a crisis where markets refuse to purchase U.S. debt? It’s possible and it would be a long and painful process. A break in the inflation regime plays out over several years. are we seeing fears of a break take hold? We think at least part of the answer is the extreme intensity of the coronavirus shock. The depth and speed of output contraction threatens to influence perceptions and risk assessment in other dimensions of this shock such as the structural legacy ( ) and the risks of structural regime break. the analytical errors resulting from them could have significant consequences in terms of setting false expectations and encouraging inappropriate plans. A few principles of intellectual discipline may help leaders avoid these analytical traps: Beware implicit and explicit equivalences to historical events. be aware of historical benchmarks. Meanwhile be aware of their drivers and relevance to the present day. Be wary of single data points and the inferences that can be drawn from them. Is there a passing resemblance or causal equivalence? Record outcomes in any data set always make great headlines particularly in financial and economic reports but the overall context determines their true significance. Step back when fear is dominating the thought process and when extrapolating from high-intensity events. Even the worst ever in one dimension doesn’t mean the worst along Be cognizant of what your scenarios imply: A depression-driven regime break also means large-scale deflation. A debt crisis regime break also means a weak currency and high inflation. Are these corollary conditions consistent and do they fit the facts?

In that time I don't know if I have ever gone three months without an Editor's Update but it has been almost that long.  The good news is that I have been continuing to make updates in the background pages.   I've been keeping the going as well.  So don't worry — I haven't completely neglected PC.net the past three months. So what's the reason for my absence?  Primarily I have been working on my first home renovation project since I moved into my house nearly ten years ago.  The entire project was supposed to be done over a month ago.  Everything has taken substantially longer and cost significantly more than what I was initially told.  And the work that has been done so far has been poor quality with no attention to detail.  It has been one of the most frustrating experiences of my life. But the thing I am most frustrated with is how much time and energy this project has sapped from my life.  It has consumed my free time and a fair amount of my sleep time.  I am constantly on the phone with contractors and suppliers talking about things I don't even care about.  At least not anymore. While I have been overwhelmed with frustration it has made me glad I waited almost ten years to get myself into this mess.  For the past nine years I have lived in a house with many things I wanted to change but didn't.  It was good enough so I didn't make the effort.  Instead I used my time and money to travel to different places around the world.  My house wasn't perfect but I didn't really care. Only now that I am completely in over my head with this renovation process have I realized how self-focused I've become.  For months I have been thinking about my house and all the decisions I have to make about my stuff.  It is a burden I haven't had before — and I'm grateful for that. I used to want a big fancy house but now I'm glad I don't have one.  Experiencing new places and meeting new people is far better than choosing paint colors and deciding on window treatments.  Hopefully this seemingly never-ending project will end soon so I can get back to traveling — and maybe post some more frequent PC.net updates as well.

When researchers measured the total motivation of employees they saw that those forced to work from home were the least motivated. But there is an effective way managers can increase their team’s productivity and performance even under the circumstances of this crisis: through experimentation. The researchers found that experimentation results in a 45-point increase in employee motivation. The key is for leaders to make sure their weekly routines are not focused only on the tactical work. Half of their weeks should also be focused on adaptive performance where there is no plan to follow an emphasis on experimentation and problem solving. a number of our coronavirus articles To get all of HBR’s content delivered to your inbox Many leaders have crossed the first hurdles of : ensuring colleagues have set up their tech tools and permanently logged into their video conference accounts. But this is just the first step towards creating an effective work environment for remote employees. The next critical question we must ask is: How do you motivate people who work from home? This question is important now because during crises such as Covid-19 people often tend to focus more on — answering the right number of tickets or following the approved project plan — rather than adapting to solve the bigger newer problems the business may be facing. But some teams rise above the rest in times of turmoil regardless of the challenges. They win market share. They earn life-long customer love. They keep their productivity high or higher. In other words . Though the academic research on remote productivity is mixed with some saying it declines while others promise it increases our research suggests that your success will depend on how you do it. it’s important to note that right now working from home is likely to reduce motivation. analyzed more than 50 major companies and conducted scores of experiments to figure out what motivates people including how much working from home plays into the equation. We survey employees of an organization asking six questions–one for each motive. Each question determines how much of each motive a person feels in their work on a scale between 1 (strongly disagree) and 7 (strongly agree). Then we use the following formula to calculate the individual’s total motivation which is then used in calculating that of the organization: (10 x the score for play) + (5 x purpose) + (1 2/3 x potential) – (1 2/3 x emotional pressure) – (5 x economic pressure) – (10 x inertia) We determined the weighting of each motive by conducting regressions between each motive and performance across industries and then simplified to build a simple metric that ranges from -100 to 100. The weights demonstrate that the closer the motive is to the work itself the more it drives performance. You can measure your ToMo or your team’s ToMo using a When we measured the total motivation of people who worked from home versus the office we found that working from home was less motivating. Even worse the differences were enormous. Total motivation dropped 17 points the equivalent of moving from one of the best to one of the most miserable cultures in their industries. that often lead to reduced work performance. These have likely spiked in light of the coronavirus pandemic. are soaring as people worry about losing their jobs and protecting their health. The barrage of news questions on how to safely get groceries and fears for relatives are deeply distressing. for work is bound to increase as people wonder if there’s a point in even trying. We also identified three positive motivators that often lead to increased work performance. We believe these are in danger of disappearing in easy-to-miss ways during the current situation. the motive that most boosts performance could decrease if it continues to becomes harder for people to get things done from home. For example people may miss the joy of problem-solving with a colleague or the ease of making a decision when everyone is in one room. could also decline with team’s decreasing visibility into their impact on clients or colleagues especially if no one is there to remind them. Lastly could decline if people can’t gain access to colleagues that teach and develop them. If business leaders don’t move to change this shifts in people’s motivation will ultimately lead to a decline in adaptability and creativity just at the time when the post-cornavirus recovery will require productivity growth. When a colleague of ours was diagnosed with cancer our first instinct was to reduce her work so she could focus on her illness. To be sure there were times she needed 100% rest. But we quickly realized that we had taken away a major source of her play and purpose. Her work was a much needed break from the anxiety-inducing news she received each day. This was also true for the firms we worked with during the financial crisis. We found that analysts trying to shore up the markets had the highest motivation levels of their careers during 18-hour work days. Military veterans we interviewed talked about their highest-stakes days in the same way. For the same reasons today you see that rather than sit at home many citizens are organizing volunteer bike courier clubs. Fitness instructors are leading classes from their or streaming them for free online. Academics are running virtual classrooms and workshops with their students. It’s important for leaders to follow suit and remember that work can deliver a much needed boost to their teams even when there’s little choice involved in their work-from-home situation. The key is resisting the temptation to make work tactical only through strict processes and procedures. While some degree of boundaries and guidelines help people move quickly too many create a vicious spiral of demotivation. In such cases people tend to stop problem-solving and thinking creatively If you want your teams to be engaged in their work you have to make their work engaging. The most powerful way to do this is to give people the opportunity to experiment and solve problems that really matter. These problems won’t be the same for every team or organization. They may not even be easy to identify at first. Your employees will need your help to do this. Ask them: Where can we deliver amazing service to our customers? What’s broken that our team can fix? What will drive growth even in a time of fear? Why are these problems critical we’re collaborating with teams across the globe that are seizing this way of working. A pharmaceutical company’s clinical trials team is experimenting with ways they can help hospitals prioritize trials and maintain safety during this crisis. Teams across the tech unicorn are generating ideas on how to ship critical goods around the world keep their clients’ supply chains running and share tips to keep their suppliers in business. An insurance company is testing ways to prioritize their skyrocketing internal chat volumes and process claims in timely ways. In the teams we work with we’ve seen productivity remain high What has made them so successful is that they are not relying solely on giant new programs or approaches that need CEO approval. They are simply finding ways to make sure every single person on their teams feels like they have a challenge that they can help solve. In your own cases this challenge can range from something as small as how to better greet customers or accommodate new schedules to something as big as moving your previously in-person business online. Taking This Back to Your Teams This all may sound great in theory but if you’re wondering how to start you’re not alone. Few organizations have been taught how to identify when and where it is OK to experiment with new ways of working — despite the fact that experimentation results in a 45-point increase in employee motivation. there’s a simple set of recommendations we give to teams who are working remotely. what you measure is the single strongest signal to your people of what you care about. If you want to show them that you care about their motivation you can measure it using our online have a discussion with them about what might be driving their motivation up or down and what would be helpful to maximize their motivation and experimentation in the weeks to come. You might ask questions like: How is the current situation affecting you at the moment? What tips do people have for how to motivate yourself and find play and purpose in the current environment? This is your time to listen and create a safe environment in which everyone can talk. make sure your weekly routines are not focused only on the tactical work – the concrete plans you need to execute like the tickets you need to answer or boxes you need to check. Half of your week should also be focused where there is no plan to follow we recommend a simple rhythm for remote teams. Hold a performance cycle meeting for the team that covers the following. What impact did we have last week and what did we learn? What commitments do we have this week? Who is on point for each? How can we help each other with this week’s commitments? What are the areas where we should experiment to improve performance this week? and who is on point for each? : Have at least one individual meeting with each of your team members. To help motivate your employees focus on helping them tackle challenges that are a slight stretch. You can also coordinate small group meetings in which employees can collaborate on the week’s experiments and tackle problems together. Focus on reflection. Showcase and gather input on the experiments of the week. This might include presentations from project groups during which team members share metrics and insights. It’s also important to check in on each other’s motivation and progress. As the leader set the example by asking people how they are feeling: Where did they struggle with their motivation and where did they thrive? We know that this approach works because we used it during the financial crisis. When most financial services teams were doubling down on rules and processes we helped thousands of people working in mortgage and home equity shops identify the problems they could solve and adapt. Their motivation skyrocketed and they outperformed the status quo by 200% finding creative win-win solutions for the financial institutions they worked at and the customers who were in danger of losing their homes. As we saw in the 2008 it is possible for teams to experiment and adapt. We also saw that it is possible for teams to freeze under pressure and recede. Make it your mission to achieve the former and achieve greater levels of growth and productivity as a remote team than as an in-person team. This is a challenge that can keep you energized and experimenting long after this crisis is behind us.

Foxconn and Foxconn’s response to it is typical of the company: It promises the world but delivers hell lay bare. Based on undercover research at Foxconn factories across China; interviews with workers and teachers; and the blogs and chat message confessions of workers and Pun Ngai illustrate how the economic successes of Apple the world’s most valuable company are interconnected and mutually dependent and are built upon the soul-crushing labor of China’s youth. Carefully balanced between first-person accounts from Foxconn workers and data-rich socio-historical and political-economic context and heartbreaking—doing the work that C. Wright Mills called for when he wrote about the need to recast “personal troubles” as “public issues.” Impeccably researched and engagingly written is an instant classic in the genre of workplace ethnography. Its academic rigor makes it a perfect university teaching text and its tone and language ensure that it will succeed among the popular audience as well. Chan and her co-authors present the first-ever book focused on Foxconn. Yet it is not a book but about how Foxconn “controls and utilizes labor ” as told directly by workers. Based on research carried out from 2010 through 2019 the book is subtly framed by the scholarly analysis of global political economy and global value chains. In the context of China’s shift to a capitalist economy embedded in global systems of production and trade the authors demonstrate how political-economic shifts created a “new working class” within China composed primarily of young rural migrants to urban centers. Noting its million-strong global labor force the authors paint a picture of Foxconn as a hungry monster that sucks in and spits out China’s youth with virtually no benefit to show for it. The book evocatively demonstrates how familial and personal relationships and even educational pathways and outcomes have been completely reconfigured by these shifts in Chinese society. More troubling shows that outcomes of Foxconn’s brutal labor regime including mental and physical injury and death on the job or as a result of it is not uncommon. Aiming to “assess the extent to which the Chinese state and global tech corporations fulfilled their responsibilities to protect workers in the context of transnational production ” Chan and her co-authors help workers to demonstrate that they unequivocally do not. begins and ends with the worker suicides that have occurred at Foxconn. The book opens with the first-person account of survivor Tian Yu who was just 17 years old when she jumped from a Foxconn dormitory and is now paralyzed from the waist down. A migrant from a rural area and despair she experienced after just one month of working at the facility. At the end of the book the authors rely on the poetry of Xu Lizhi who died by suicide in 2014 to similarly articulate the exhaustion and hopelessness he experienced prior to his occupational death. Both are examples of the book’s greatest asset: the profound respect that is shown for Foxconn’s workforce manifested in the in-depth interviews and long-term relationships that were necessary to bring such a rich portrait of humanity and suffering to life. the authors demonstrate how the rise of Foxconn is typical of the “Asian miracle ” in which Taiwanese electronics firms established from the 1960s capitalized by first outsourcing production to China where labor and the cost of production where cheaper on the corporate welfare doled out by the Chinese state. Part of that corporate welfare package was the creation and maintenance of a massive pool of surplus labor. Initially this was through disinvestment in state-owned businesses and later it was by supporting development of new Foxconn facilities inland nearer to jobless rural populations where wages are lower than in the now-developed coastal areas. The state also coerces the labor of teenage students of technical colleges by pinning their educational standing and program funding to submission to Foxconn’s brutal labor regime. (What’s that Apple says about education being in its DNA?) That regime is compellingly detailed throughout the book but comes into specific focus in a chapter that counterposes the day-to-day realities of working the production lines with Foxconn’s and Apple’s corporate propaganda. Readers may already be familiar with the conditions that are typical to Foxconn which have now been widely reported in the media adds to this well-known list of offenses is how Foxconn management rotates day- and night-shift workers every few weeks to disrupt their equilibrium and prevent them from forming the strong ties necessary to successful resistance. Foxconn’s increasing reliance on temporary and contracted workers and on the labor of student “interns” also serves this end as well as that of pushing down wages. The authors also reveal that Apple is squarely to blame for conditions within the factories. The production schedule and quotas and cost cuts imposed by Apple are shown to be the direct cause of the inhumane working schedules and lack of a living wage experienced by workers as Foxconn prioritizes profits and placating Apple over workers’ safety and dignity. is that China prohibits trade unions. The corporate-run unions that stand in their place exist really to surveil workers and root out “troublemakers” who raise complaints. By prohibiting unions harassing and imprisoning activists and journalists and hampering the work of civil-society organizations the state maintains and reproduces a large and precarious labor pool. A detailed account of how the Chinese state channels labor disputes into an individualized judiciary process reveals yet another tactic that ensures that a labor movement cannot form. And when it disregards the multitude of labor and environmental laws that are broken in processes of production the state placates large brands like Apple at the expense of its citizens. In the absence of trade unions workers and their families try in earnest to get justice via both official channels and protests. They engage in frequent protests—some riotous some covert (slowdowns and intentional damage on the line)—which give the lie to those who claim workers are happy to have these jobs and that the current form of capitalist industrialization is good for China. The authors see hope and promise in this struggle and conclude by calling for a broad-based social movement in support of workers’ rights. Yet they also demonstrate how workers’ demands are typically met with symbolic compromises that neutralize the unrest rather than with meaningful change. misses a few opportunities. While the authors do occasionally make the point that the conditions observed are common to the electronics industry generally and the realities of globalized production and supply chains more broadly the subtle ways in which this is done may undermine the point. There is value to making this argument more prominently lest readers come away with a picture of Foxconn and Apple as bad actors operating in an otherwise acceptable system. In the same vein the narrative could do with a stronger connection to the global trade policies and corporate tax systems that provide the larger context and conditions in which Apple and Foxconn operate. like what allows this situation to continue? The authors make clear the roles of Apple and the Chinese state here or our governments? What can we do about it? Pinning hope on workers alone to rise up seems a lot to ask of a population that has no time for anything but work or sleep and who suffer from mental and physical exhaustion as a norm. Telling the reader what they can do to hold accountable the global capitalist system that creates and maintains these conditions in their home countries and around the world might have made for a more meaningful conclusion for readers. But perhaps that is asking too much is an excellent book and fills an important gap in the literature.

1620764972.384748,44307973,https://pc.net/news/2018-07-28/lost_apple_watch_activity_data,"How I Lost 1.5 Years of Apple Watch Activity Data I just lost a year and a half of activity data.  Everything I recorded with my Apple Watch from January 7 2018 is gone.  All my daily step counts and calories burned — gone.  All my runs and sports played — gone.  Everything is gone. The main reason I bought the Apple Watch at the beginning of 2017 was to .  So it was devastating to permanently lose all the data I have meticulously recorded the past 18 months.  It is hard to justify even wearing my Apple Watch now. So how did I lose all my activity data? Apple lost my data.  Let me explain... stopped recording data in the Activity app on February 8 2018.  When I returned from my I thought the Activity app would finally sync correctly with my Apple Watch but it never did.  All the days after February 8 had no activity data. I searched dozens of forums online and asked several employees at my local Apple Store and no one had an answer.  At the end of March I finally called AppleCare and a representative recommended I unpair my Apple Watch erase and restore my iPhone then re-pair my watch.  I did these steps and then the Activity app showed this. For almost four months that is the only screen I saw when viewing the Activity app on my iPhone.  I was hopeful that one day the bug would be fixed and I could finally view all the activity I had been recording.  I was especially optimistic at the end of May when the iOS 11.4 release notes said it fixed a Health data syncing issue.  But alas when I completed the update the Activity app still displayed a black screen with a spinning wheel. the AppleCare representative I had been working with checked again with Apple's engineers and then called me one night with ""good news and bad news.""  The good news was the engineers found a solution to the problem.  The bad news is the solution was to delete all my data and start from scratch.  Seriously. This was not an acceptable solution for me so I continued to be patient and wait for a better solution.  A few weeks ago the executive team at Apple reached out to me and had a senior support specialist look into my case.  The engineers confirmed my data was corrupt and the only way to fix the problem I was having was to permanently erase all of my activity data After six months of not being able to view my activity data I resigned to myself to the fact there was no other solution.  I followed AppleCare's steps of deleting my Health data then erasing and restoring my iPhone from iCloud.  I can now see my Activity data again.  My Apple Watch restored about a month of previous data to my iPhone but most of my activity rings for the past 18 months are now empty.  I keep getting alerts on my watch for achievements that I reached a long time ago which at this point kind of feels insulting. I went through the standard stages of grief — shock anger — and now I am just sad.  All the activities I recorded over the past year and a half are gone.  I can't compare anything with 2017 which was my main reason for recording my activities so consistently the past six months.  All those times I pressed ""Start Activity"" on my Apple Watch were pointless.  All I have are a few screenshots I took before midnight because I knew I wouldn't be able to view the information once the watch struck 12:00. but mainly because it should be impossible for this to happen.  In the rare case that data is corrupted it should never compromise the integrity of valid data.  Yet my Watch and/or iPhone uploaded corrupt activity data to iCloud and it corrupted all of my Health data.  This is poor programming on the part of Apple's engineers. all my data locally and remotely so why didn't I just restore my data from a backup?  Because the Apple Watch hides all activity data in iCloud and it the actual data log is completely inaccessible to the user.  Therefore Apple is 100% in control of the integrity of my data — and the data of everyone else who uses an Apple Watch.  (Yes this is blatant violation of GDPR.)  There was no way for me to back up my activity data locally and there was no way for me to roll back to the last valid (uncorrupt) state.  The simple fact is Apple's failed me and I permanently lost my data. I appreciated Apple's executive team reaching out to me but in the end their only consolation was to say ""Sorry.""  I can accept a sincere apology but it doesn't make up for 18 months of lost activity data and over 40 hours of emails and phone calls with AppleCare.  I was already at a low point in my relationship with Apple after a horrible experience with an iMac repair last December and this has definitely made things worse. I'm back to recording my activity data with my Apple Watch again but now with an uneasy feeling of trepidation.  Who knows when I might lose my data again?  There is still no way for me to save my data locally and as far as I know Apple does not make incremental backups of the data in the cloud.  If data gets corrupted again I'm back to square one. I cannot recommend the Apple Watch to anyone. Please enable JavaScript to view the ",[],Yes,"business:0.06747745722532272,history:-0.05975354090332985",

1620765029.809526,10421922,https://newpol.org/review/a-story-from-a-defeated-struggle/,"A Story from a Defeated Struggle (New Politics Vol. XVIII No. 2 Losing Santhia: Life and Loss in the Struggle for Tamil Eelam president confirmed what many already feared: that more than 20 000 people who disappeared during the country’s civil war were dead. They were among the victims of the repression of the Tamil Tigers in May 2009. The Tigers’ defeat ended 26 years of military struggle for self-determination by the Tamil minority in Sri Lanka. Losing Santhia: Life and Loss in the Struggle for Tamil Eelam Australian socialist Ben Hillier tells the story of one participant in this struggle. Santhia was a leading member of the Tamil Tigers who joined the movement as a teenager and died as a refugee in Indonesia in 2017. She was 42 years old. Speaking with surviving activists and refugees Hillier combines their memories of Santhia with the history of the conflict. Hillier’s illustrated essay throughout contains excerpts of poetry written by women members of the Tamil Tigers. The text is part political commentary and part reporting from the aftermath of the Tigers’ defeat. the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) was a formidable movement capable of resisting state forces and establishing its own de-facto state in the north of Sri Lanka. Hillier relays how people he interviewed expressed their pride as members of an oppressed minority who finally won a state they felt was their own. Hillier traces the roots of the conflict to Sri Lanka’s history as a British colony. Like other colonial powers the British applied a strategy of divide and rule on the island pitting the Tamil minority against the Buddhist Sinhalese majority. The end of British colonialism came as a result of a negotiated settlement that left a Buddhist Sinhalese elite in political power. Unlike in other former colonies where a common struggle against the colonial power brought forth a new national identity the dividing lines drawn by the British persisted. and state power increasingly combined into a reactionary form of nationalism and “from the 1960s ‘Sinhalese’ and ‘Buddhist’ became synonymous.” This combination was symbolized by the increasing political activism and power of Buddhist monks who regarded the Tamil minority as an existential threat to the Buddhist Sinhalese. The 1972 constitution defined the country as a “unitary state ” denying the Tamils a right to self-determination. Sri Lanka had a large self-declared Marxist left. A nominally Trotskyist party the LSSP (Lanka Sama Samaja Party literally: Lanka Equal Society Party) had gained mass support in the late forties and joined the Fourth International. In his memoirs a leader of the Fourth International at the time discussed the evolution of the party.* Already in 1960 he described the situation the LSSP found itself in: “Given its largely Sinhalese composition it always appeared as a party of the ‘other’ nationality to Indian [Tamil] workers ” while its support for minority rights was “not seen as truly ‘national’ from the point of view of broad layers of backward workers and other Sinhalese.” the party needed to create organic links between the movements of Tamil and Sinhalese workers “an absolute condition for which without any hesitation or holding back of the minority’s national rights.” Unfortunately the LSSP choose the opposite path and supported Sinhalese bourgeois political forces. A few years after Maitan urged it to support the rights of the Tamil minority the LSSP was expelled from the Fourth International. Sinhalese chauvinists increasingly whipped up violence against the Tamil minority leading to bloody pogroms. During the seventies Tamil radicals started to form armed revolutionary groups. Some of these saw their struggle as part of a revolution that needed to be Sri Lanka-wide and considered the Sinhalese working class as a potential ally. But in the absence of strong reliable allies among the Sinhalese and facing increasing racist violence Tamil movements increasingly focused on their national struggle. A turning point would be a 1983 pogrom known as “Black July.” Hillier writes “The violence spiraled as monks backed by the police and military mobilized Sinhalese mobs in more orgies of violence.” The violence left as many as three thousand dead and more than one hundred thousand homeless. Tamil youth flocked to join the armed movements chief among them the LTTE. Some years later the Tamil Tigers built up strength and support. Eventually they signed a ceasefire with the Sri Lanka government allowing the Tigers to consolidate their position. The Tigers constructed a shadow administration with its own police and judicial system among other entities. By this time the LTTE had abandoned the demand for secession instead demanding a form of autonomy. as different Sinhalese forces opposed the kind of structural changes that would have been required to meet Tamil demands for self-determination. Buddhist monks organized Sinhala chauvinist mobilizations against any kind of federal system or power sharing. Hillier quotes an army general who bitterly complained about being victimized by the contempt expressed by Tamil youth. All liberation movements share something: “some proud authority unable to comprehend the hatred of the people whose everyday deference is interpreted as a sincere display rather than a performance later cursed in private.” the movement became known for assassinations as it pioneered suicide-bombing as method of attack. But the movement cannot be reduced to this violence and Hillier shows how it was a contradictory combination of liberation and authoritarianism. The movement’s need for mobilization went against conservative norms and challenged ideas of hierarchies based on caste and clan. The involvement of women in the struggle went against sexist norms as the necessity of mobilization broke old taboos. Women gained new positions of authority and confidence. Their gains were real but their position remained contradictory as the Tigers also enforced sexist norms. For example women working in civilian Tiger institutions were required to wear traditional and restrictive dresses. At other times caste practices were tolerated on pragmatic grounds. the Tigers extended the logic of war beyond that of the fight against the government army. To assert their dominance over the Tamil movement the LTTE organized the assassination of leaders of rival Tamil movements and of socialists who opposed its orientation toward guerrilla struggle. Inside the movement power ultimately remained in the hands of a patriarchal figure; the authority of founder and leader Velupillai Prabhakaran was unchallenged. This was a liberation movement without democracy. a hard-line Sinhalese chauvinist (and older brother of the current president) won the Sri Lanka presidential election. Sinhalese chauvinist forces continued to mobilize to crush the Tamil movement. The Tigers had developed more and more into a conventional army but in purely military terms they were no match for the government army. In Hillier’s estimation the ultimate cause for the defeat of the Tamil Tigers lies in a changing international situation. Hillier describes the role of India and European powers in international crackdowns against the Tigers’ fundraising in the Tamil diaspora and in blocking arms shipments. With the aid of a faction of traitorous former Tigers the Sri Lankan state went on the offensive. As state governments pushed through the Tiger defenses more and more people fled. In early 2009 the Sri Lankan government declared a “No Fire Zone” within Tiger-held territory supposedly to provide safety to civilian refugees. The army subjected the No Fire Zone to sustained bombardment. The government refused all attempts to broker a ceasefire and continued the offensive. In May 2009 The victory of the Sri Lankan state was made possible aid for it “also came from states at odds with the West. Aid worth billions of dollars was offered by China and Pakistan.” The Tamils’ international isolation was complete. On May 27 an Orwellian UN Human Rights Council resolution praised the government of Sri Lanka for “protecting human rights ” while condemning acts of terrorism by the Tigers. How many were killed in the war is unknown. In addition to thousands of combatants tens of thousands of civilians were killed—most were killed by government forces. Attempts to investigate the scale of the killings and human rights violations were obstructed by the Sri Lankan government and its international allies. In February 2020 appointed as prime minister by his brother a few months earlier declared Sri Lanka was withdrawing from a United Nations resolution investigating alleged war crimes. and what remains of the Tamil movement is now desperately struggling to defend minimal democratic rights. Hillier ends his essay by asking what next? The areas of the former Tamil Tiger state have become occupied territory. After the 2015 election defeat of Mahinda Rajapaksa by his former ally Maithripala Sirisena but the government’s policy of Sinhalization continues. Drawing a comparison with policies of the Israeli state Hillier describes it as a strategy of creating “facts on the ground.” The Tamil language is erased from the public sphere as streets and other place names are changed Sinhala capital and the army’s economic projects push out Tamil enterprises and the government attempts to change the demographic composition of the area by bringing in large numbers of Sinhala. The last section of the book is composed of the text “Liberation Tigers and Tamil Eelam Freedom Struggle ” written by the Tigers’ chief negotiator Anton Balasingham on behalf of the Tigers’ political committee in 1983. It describes the early Tamil Tiger view of the history of the island and of their rationale for launching a military struggle. The text is an historical document like many other national movements at the time the Tamil Tigers expressed their struggle in “Marxist-Leninist” terms even though the movement never claimed to be communist. Rather than an academic article or a comprehensive overview of the complicated history of the struggle is a text that helps the reader understand the motivations and viewpoints of participants in an often ignored or mischaracterized struggle. The logical allies of the Tamils “remain the impoverished Sinhalese workers and peasants. … It remains the island’s greatest political catastrophe that the once powerful Sinhalese left failed to stand with the Tamils and launch a united fight for the liberation of all exploited and oppressed people.” By letting Tigers speak for themselves Hillier enables readers to hear from survivors of this tragedy.

Now a common first question is ""How good is the Wi-Fi?"" Cruise ships are notorious for slow and unreliable Internet connections.  This is because of two primary reasons: 1) many cruise ships were built before Internet access was an expectation of travelers and 2) they only have a satellite link to the Internet.  After all it's hard to find wireless floating in the middle of sea. I had low expectations for Internet connectivity before beginning my recent journey to Antarctica on the Hurtigruten MS Fram.  I thought I might have to wait until I returned home to post any of my pictures on this fear was unfounded and I was able to use the Internet for most of the trip. I signed up for the ""VIP"" Wi-Fi package which provided Internet access for the entire journey which was nearly 14 days.  Hurtigruten offered a few other options such as 24-hour or 72-hour access but I did not entertain those options.  The receptionist also told me that the VIP Internet access was the fastest so it was a no-brainer.  I don't know how the VIP package compared to the other access levels but at least I can say the VIP Internet access was great. I should qualify what I mean by ""great.""  On average it took about a minute to upload a 1 photo.  So publishing 30 photos to my Antarctica album on Facebook took about 30 minutes.  That's about 16.7 KBps .  That is by no means fast (it's less than a tenth the speed of a slow but it worked.  When we were near the shore or close to tall mountains the Internet connection was much slower or even unresponsive.  Otherwise upload and download speeds were pretty consistent for the duration of the trip. Considering I was sharing a single Internet connection with over 200 travelers on the Fram I was pleasantly surprised with the consistency of the Internet connection.  I noticed an extraordinary number of wireless repeaters around the ship which were spread out on the ceilings of every level about 30 feet apart.  I did not find a single place on the ship were I was unable to connect to Wi-Fi. it does not come naturally for me to compliment anything Norwegian.  But Internet access on the Hurtigruten MS Fram was better than I expected so I must give credit where credit is due.  I should also mention the ship staff and expedition crew were fantastic.  As for Antarctica — it was one of the most incredible places I have ever been.  If you ever decide to make the voyage yourself I recommend seeing what trips Hurtigruten has to offer.

The airports (both EZE and AEP) had readily accessible Wi-Fi and surprisingly fast data speeds.  However once I got outside the airport it was a different story.  In the few days I was in Buenos Aires I did not find one free hotspot.  I didn't even find a free Wi-Fi connection where I had to sign up with my email address (which was Each hotel I stayed at provided Wi-Fi though the experience differed widely among the hotels.  The first hotel provided free Wi-Fi with a standard password used by all guests.  The connection was reasonably fast but nothing like my cable connection back home.  The second hotel provided Internet access with a custom login for each room but with a maximum of three devices per room.  That is a problem when you have two travelers .  The third hotel provided Internet access with a universal password (that was way too long) and a very choppy Internet connection.  It only worked about 20% of the time which was problematic when I was trying to load Google Maps before I journeyed out into the city. most restaurants and coffee shops in Buenos Aires provide Internet access to patrons with a custom Wi-Fi password.  (It helps to know a little Spanish when requesting the password since many Argentinians do not speak English.)  I attempted to make my usual Starbucks stop to see if I could get free Wi-Fi without a password but this was how the Starbucks near my hotel looked in the middle of the day. I never did find out what kind of Wi-Fi access Starbucks provides in Buenos Aires.  I was mostly in the Monserrat area of the city so maybe a more ritzy area like Palermo had a Starbucks that was actually open.  But of course why go to Starbucks when you can visit a local coffee shop? if you need Internet access in Buenos Aires you can usually find it by requesting the Wi-Fi password in a local restaurant or hotel.  But completely free Wi-Fi is almost non-existent.  I recommend signing up for your mobile provider's international data plan to be safe. Please enable JavaScript to view the ,[],No,,

MLK was assassinated in Memphis standing with the sanitation workers in their strike over unfair labor practices and the death of two workers. America’s Civil Rights Movement is often marked as starting with the 1954 Supreme Court decision and displayed through massive resistance efforts seen by many Americans on television and through photography. This lens neglects African Americans’ long struggle for civil rights and how each generation of activists laid the foundation for what occurred in what most Americans know as the Modern Civil Rights Movement of the 1950’s and beyond. It overlooks the consistent themes issues and symbols that have lingered around race in America dating from the early abolition movement as evidenced in abolition symbols. Among the striking concerns resonating through the long arc of history are the inhuman treatment and lack of recognition of black manhood equal opportunity as well as the degradation of black womanhood and families. Octavius V. Catto’s activism addressed many of these concerns in the Civil War/Reconstruction period  when he helped lead the call to create United States Colored Troops pushed for ratification of the 13th and worked to de-segregate public transit in Philadelphia. These were the same concerns at the Memphis Sanitation Strike in 1968 which Martin Luther King spent his last hours of life supporting Black life and communities across the country have largely been invisible to most white Americans even today. Their stories and issues were not covered by white media outlets whether print or later radio. The recent NBC documentary the Movement and the Media dramatized how coverage of black America before the mid-20th Century was scant and even today is limited. When blacks were mentioned in white newspapers they were often presented as nameless individuals: “a Negro man” or “a Negro woman”. This neglect is the reason African American communities formed their own media outlets newspapers and later radio stations responding to the call: “If not us who will!” The formation of African American newspapers began in 1827 with a weekly four column publication printed every Friday by free born African Americans John Russwurm and Samuel Cornish. It became the voice for the black generation that preceded Octavius Catto. This newspaper tradition continued with Frederick Douglass’ (today America’s oldest continuously published black newspaper first published in 1884) and nearly 200 other papers today. (More on the black press see the 1999 award-winning PBS documentary: The Black Press: Soldiers Without Swords It was only with the new television medium which engaged “live action” and “up to the minute reporting” that MLK and others were able to strategically use it to bring attention to racism and how it impacted black life. However most African Americans and whites continue to live as the Kerner Commission reported in 1968 in “two separate societies one black and one white social media has become the new approach that black communities are using bring forward evidence of their concerns about social injustice. The Civil War and Reconstruction period was an important touchstone for civil rights. It is Octavius V. Catto and his generation that helped change the meaning of the U.S. Constitution through their local and national efforts to gain ratify the “Freedom Amendments” and their early protests that expanded public access education and opportunities for black people. These opened a floodgate of activism by blacks that led to the creation of important civil rights organizations highly educated black middle class who became the vanguard for social change in ongoing generations. that the Catto story is told as a story of community and alliances. American public memory of history is generally presented as a triumph of individualism focused on the achievements of one great person and not recognizing the community dynamics of social change. This has particularly been the case in telling the story of African Americans. The long struggle for civil rights in the black community dating back to the founding of the nation has been an effort to “change the nation” and it took the fortitude and courage of successive generations of both sexes to move the needle. What is most extraordinary and compelling about Catto’s story are the broad alliances within a national network of African Americans and white supporters that made his achievements possible. With the Civil War Catto and his associates envisioned the promise of the Declaration of Independence for black America. It was this optimism that the boundaries of the past that limited citizenship and opportunities for African Americans would be removed to produce new institutions and laws that laid foundations for the Modern Civil Rights Movement. This American civil rights story is the story of forging citizenship and opportunity. we will explore how O.V. Catto was an important leader in this effort with Philadelphia as a leading center. It will examine the themes messages and agendas that marked America’s civil rights story across the decades up to the birth of Martin Luther King. 127th United States Colored Troops Regimental Flag September 1864 organized and trained at Camp William Penn (near Philadelphia). artist.

1620765087.159797,56830588,https://www.historic-uk.com/Blog/Middletons-Hotel-York-Review/,York – A Historic UK Review York – A Historic UK Review We were lucky enough to stay at Middletons on our recent trip to York thanks to the kind folks at the hotel is spread out across a sprawling site within the city walls (second only in size to York’s famous Minster) and is made up of six historic buildings dating back to the 17th century. These buildings have played host to a number of influential guests over the years such as lord mayors artists and composers like Benjamin Britten. However perhaps one of the more famous former inhabitants is Charlie Chaplin for which Charlie Chaplin House was named. Middletons itself is named after Dame Anne Middleton benefactor and wife of Peter Middleton 17th century Sheriff of York. Dame Anne funded the hospital and refuge for widows of the Freemen of the City of York in 1659 which would become the current Lady Anne House. The hotel is made up of 56 bedrooms across the site ranging from £99.00 per night*. As a family of three with a two year old toddler we stayed in a deluxe room in Lady Anne House on a bed and breakfast basis. Whilst the bathroom was a little dated (as can often be the case with a listed property) we appreciated the extra touches in the room such as the coffee machine and fresh milk (which makes such a difference and is rarely offered!). As parents the separate living room came in very handy since you don’t want to sit whispering in the dark on overnight trips once your little darlings are tucked in for the night! Above: The master bedroom at Middletons Breakfast the next morning was a help yourself buffet affair with plentiful high quality continental and cooked options available and sufficient staff on hand to provide high chairs and top ups when needed. The hotel’s location is ideal for exploring all that York City Centre has to offer and – miracle of miracles for the centre of York – car parking is also available on site although it can be a little tight if parking is not high on your skills list. Being close enough to leave the car behind and secluded enough to nip back for an afternoon nap (whether you are a toddler or not!) made Middletons a winner in our book. Above: Our living room at Middletons we thought the size of the room and facilities on offer were extremely good value for a city centre hotel. What really made our stay though were the fantastic staff who couldn’t do enough and always made us feel very welcome (not always the case when you have a lively small person in tow!). From the complementary glass of milk promptly delivered for our toddler at bedtime to being able to leave our copious number of bags safely stowed long after check-out we felt very well looked after and would definitely return on future trips to York. *Please see the hotel website or call the hotel directly on 01904 611570 for a current price list.

Free Wi-Fi was particularly hard to come by even in busy areas.  The norm seemed to be the ""sign-up to access the Internet"" option which I've never liked.  In all my years using the Internet I've never signed up for a ""fake"" email account.  For me it's usually not worth providing my personal information to a random company for a few minutes of Internet access. recognized internationally for their free Wi-Fi more than the quality of their coffee often required me to create an account in order to access their Internet connection.

My main connection was from my hotel near Lincoln's Inn Fields.  The hotel provided free public Internet access without any login.

1620765102.4764366,64216963,https://newpol.org/issue_post/unions-democracy-and-%e2%80%a8the-third-camp/,"Comparing Lessons from New Politics and Herman Benson (New Politics Vol. XVIII No. 2 The decline of labor has been accompanied by an opportunity we have not seen in decades. A new generation of socialists many of them members of Democratic Socialists of American are enthusiastically discussing the role of the working class and unions in the fight for socialism. Making the best use of this development requires critically analyzing the past several decades of struggle among labor leftists about how a commitment to socialism “from below” might inform our union activity. In this article I try to frame and spur that debate by comparing the perspective of Herman Benson with material published by other contributors to founded by Benson’s contemporaries Phyllis and Julius Jacobson. When Herman Benson died last summer obituary captured his accomplishments and political history with remarkable political accuracy. It noted Benson’s role as a prominent defender of union democracy and the roots of his political ideals in the Workers Party (WP) and later the Independent Socialist League (ISL) which opposed both capitalism and Stalinism breaking with Trotsky and the Trotskyists over whether the Soviet Union was a society that deserved the political support of socialists. Yet for all it got right the obituary and accolades to Benson’s impressive contributions missed a contradiction in his legacy: how his singular focus on democratizing the unions undercut what he defined as the ultimate aim of his project revitalizing the labor movement and in doing so defending democracy in society. Benson mentored student activists from the 1960s and 70s who identified with the independent socialist tradition a political milieu that informed his embrace of union democracy. For the WP and ISL the struggle for union democracy was essential as a good in itself because it improves workers’ lives and because it educates the working class about ideals needed to emancipate all of humanity from economic and social oppression. Union democracy is indispensable in the fight for democracy and socialism from below. It’s fair to say Benson became the best-known advocate of union democracy in left labor circles because of his passionate and informed support of dissidents’ struggles and his longevity in that support. He provided young activists—student radicals inspired to undertake a “turn to the working class” based on ideas articulated in “Toward the Working Class” by Kim Moody and Mike Flug and in Hal Draper’s “Why the Working Class?”—with the rich knowledge of the labor movement Benson had acquired in his own years as a worker supporting them as they undertook the daunting task of democratizing the unions to which Marxists had traditionally oriented. The shift from activity in the student movement toward “industrialization” adhered to the traditional Marxist definition of the working class: “into the factories and unions.” and support from the Association for Union Democracy which he founded and led were invaluable to union activists who could find help nowhere else in their struggles to make their unions respect the most basic tenets of democracy. His contributions were remarkable and worthy of more respect and attention than they received during his life a fact due in good part to the proclivity of many radicals and liberals to consider fights for democracy within unions as somehow anti-union. In reality as Benson argued so forcefully and well the absence of basic democratic rights for union members weakened the labor movement; the “bad press” unions received because dissidents fought for the right to fair elections and freedom to expose and oust corrupt officials was no news to union members already alienated from the organizations that took their dues and failed to heed their voices. I think another factor in Benson’s not receiving his due was his insistence that the project of union democracy had to be isolated from left politics. He equated radicals’ insistence that union revitalization went hand and in hand with labor supporting demands for social justice with ideas that he had rejected about the revolutionary potential of the working class. As he put it “If the working class refuses to dedicate itself to the Marxist ambition it still pursues its own. Workers’ organizations may not have taken revolutionary power but they have almost everywhere and always been one of the chief social forces in defense of democracy in society. You may impose on your daughter the mission of becoming the president of the United States but it is no failure if she ‘only’ becomes a good doctor.” ” what I would characterize as the formal procedural protections—often denied or violated—essential for members to have voice in and control over the organizations that represent them. My experience as a union activist committed to democracy and my further work in helping reformers in teachers unions have persuaded me that democratic rights in unions depend on policies consciously crafted and carried out to encourage the idea that members “own” the union and exercise that ownership through their involvement. Such policies restrain the power of staff and officers through bottom-up control and a culture of respectful debate and criticism. A caucus is also necessary much of the time to maintain the procedures and culture that underlie the union’s democratic functioning. Benson’s view of the working class and the implications for the fight for union democracy were reshaped when he reexamined the WP and ISL break with Trotskyism. He concluded that the test of whether a society is a workers state—who owns the property—and the concomitant belief that democratic control over productive property would insure social justice were wrong: “No change in the form of property ownership will erase the conflict among contending social groups. As far as we can see the need will continue to defend people below from the administrators and privileged strata above. From that standpoint the test is not property forms but democracy which provides the means of that defense.” Thus the “key to social justice lies in the control of the state in the battle of democracy. Such is the inseparable link between socialism and democracy.” the fight for union democracy is a struggle that by itself can transform the society through the vast cadre of union members “imbued with the conviction that their unions truly belonged to them and not to the salaried officialdom.” They would be a political “army of millions of missionaries who would speak up for unions and labor’s cause to their relatives in their churches and clubs the mood of the nation could be affected and the labor movement restored to a powerful social and political force.” His belief in the singular solitary power of union democracy excluded union reformers offering cures for “the many social and economic ills of the nation or of the labor movement.” In many exchanges with radicals Benson dismissed the need for radical changes that he saw denigrating the centrality of the fight for union democracy though he conceded in one debate we have a better labor movement. The entry of nurses and public employees has made a difference. The labor movement is more sensitive to the concerns of minorities and immigrants.” Missing was an explanation of why the labor movement had become “more sensitive” to social oppression or why this was a positive development. Accompanying Benson’s rejection of the revolutionary potential of the working class was his dismissal of the idea of the Third Camp which he described as a slogan designed to make as “thought-provoking as possible our opposition to what we denounced as the two warring imperialist camps. But it took on double significance. It made clear in the context of world war [World War II] our clear opposition to the two rival social systems: capitalism versus the new social order of bureaucratic collectivism as represented by the Soviet Union under Stalin.” Like so many of his generation experiencing dashed hopes and expectations of working-class revolution led to jettisoning consistent opposition to both capitalism and communism the notion of the Third Camp which Benson described as “less a program of action and more a kind of mystical consolation for its adherents out there is a powerful social force that will turn our ideals of a just peaceful society from a dream into a reality.” A Contrasting View of Union Democracy and Socialism Benson’s certitude about key issues in the struggle for union democracy embrace of using the courts and eschewing calls for unions to adopt the demands of social movements for equality were not shared by all his former comrades in the WP and ISL whose work was published in ). For Benson as well as his critics from the left the centrality of union democracy was a given. As Burton Hall wrote in “Should unions be democratic? The question seems almost pointless. Unionism after all is a struggle for democracy a struggle to democratize the industrial regime. It is nothing if it is not democratic.” Union dissent was an important enough concern that the Jacobsons helped publish Autocracy and Insurgency in Organized Labor with Transaction Books. (The other collection they published was edited by Julius Jacobson about the Soviet Union and the socialist vision.) Because the Jacobsons conceived of as a space for pointed debate and controversy as Phyllis noted in a 1983 speech hosted by Tamiment Library the journal always invited responses from the union leaders its writers criticized. On the other hand the Association for Union Democracy newsletter was devoted to advocacy and seldom allowed officials to respond to critiques. When I submitted a letter to critical of violations of democracy in the United Federation of Teachers (UFT) because Benson had commended it as a model of democracy (issue #36) Benson at first rejected my piece explaining AUD took up much more serious breaches of democracy like murder of dissidents in gangster unions. I appealed to Benson noting the double standard to which he held white collar unions; union officials victimizing opponents by colluding with the employer to fire them was no minor problem. Benson published the piece—with a response from UFT President Albert Shanker which I think may have been the only time a union official had the opportunity for a rejoinder in . Decades later Benson described the longtime political connections that had led to Shanker and the UFT being considered an AUD ally. Burton Hall’s defense of union democracy sketched a far more critical and nuanced view of using the courts than Benson advocated. In the Fall 1964 issue of Hall concluded the “closer ‘growing together’ of the unions and the state power” had weakened the fight for rank and file control of their unions. In his Summer 1968 article “Labor Insurgency and the Legal Trap ” Hall examined the numerous legal barriers to rank and file control. Hall proposed as an alternative direct action “the classic instance being the series of post-World War II wildcat strikes in the East Coast longshore industry.” What gave that revolt its peculiarly effective character was the fact that the rebelling longshore [workers] rather than demanding that employers bargain with their rank and file organization demanded instead that their corrupt union leadership renegotiate with the employers the terms of the collective bargaining agreements. It would seem that direct action of that kind addressing its demands to union leadership and the employers jointly is the approach which—when coupled with the parallel exercise of whatever legal and administrative procedures are available to the rebellious workers—comprises the rank and file strategy best suited to cope with the facts of bureaucratic labor relations. (38) Hall’s articles pre-dated debates in the independent socialist movement among my generation about whether and how to use the bourgeois courts in union struggles. Unfortunately the reexamination of direct action and reliance on the courts he attempted to initiate didn’t occur. While it may have been that Benson’s strategy which was accepted by activists who created and Teamsters for a Democratic Union discussion about the complexity of what was lost and what was gained in using the courts didn’t occur. This was to the detriment of our understanding of the role of socialists in unions. As the “red state” walkouts of teachers in 2018 suggest organized independently of unions and government regulations that establish collective bargaining deserve the more serious attention Hall proposed. An exchange between Hall and Benson about democracy in the Painters Union in the 1973 Spring and Winter issues of marred for this reader by polemics that cross the border to vituperation raises questions that have been denied the serious scrutiny they deserve: Under what conditions should union reformers attempting to democratize their unions assume leadership? What is the role of the caucus once union reformers are elected? Burton Hall’s original article cast Ralph Schonfeld who had run on a program of democratizing the union as having betrayed the cause colluding with employers and retreating from pledges to end the practice of business agents appointing shop stewards. Benson who had assisted Schonfeld in his election and in his role as president responded in the next issue with Hall replying to both. Space limitations prohibit me from summarizing this rich debate but Hall’s arguments are stunningly relevant in current efforts to reform teachers unions and perhaps others as well. First Schonfeld was elected without a majority on the executive committee and in opposition to the international union. Hence he faced considerable opposition in carrying out the reform program on which he had been elected with the support of a caucus. Hall concluded Schonfeld had made a compromise fatal to energizing the rank and file when he backed off from refusing to allow business agents to appoint shop stewards. Hall maintained rank and file control had been undercut by Schonfeld’s “backdoor compromises with the enemy or by simple bureaucratic refusal to work with fellow members of one’s own caucus.” Benson in turn accused Hall of being disgruntled because of the lapsed business relationship he had with Schonfeld as his lawyer. Hall assailed Benson’s uncritical defense of Schonfeld and the turn against other union “reformers who have become disenchanted with Schonfeld” (Spring 1973 disregarding the perhaps understandable and yet unfortunate viciousness of the exchange I think Hall’s arguments about the importance of the caucus remaining a force after its candidates win office are wise and ring true given what has occurred in unions with which I am most familiar: teachers unions that have elected progressive leaders committed to democracy and also subject to the conservatizing pressures of leading unions with members who do not share all of their political ideas. An irony of Benson’s mentorship of activists who embraced the same political tradition that he had in his youth was that those who “industrialized” conceived of the working class in a way Benson himself called into question: “The goal of democratic social control of ownership is in the common interests of government and private employees students—the 99 percent mass of humanity. To pinch that goal into the narrow notion of ‘workers’ state’ is to limit the appeal of the socialist message. Not ‘workers’ state’ but ‘democratic socialist state’ to break the hold of capital and install democratic control over the economy.” But the turn to the working class operationalized the traditional Marxist definition of which unions and work counted—manufacturing and transportation—and resulted in the exit of socialists out of white collar public employee unions in which they had established credibility and leadership. Steve Zeluck described the vigorous challenge mounted in the American Federation of Teachers by proponents of democracy who allied with the Black community in demands for freedom and quality schools; that is just one example of the formidable influence socialists had in some public employee unions. What would have occurred had socialists remained in these unions? We can’t say for certain but we do know the loss of employment in manufacturing and industrial unions and the upsurge in militancy in teachers unions suggests a miscalculation about not only what was happening in capitalism but also how socialists should regard union work and who comprises the working class. Benson’s strict demarcation of the issues on which one should organize in unions legal restrictions on democratic rights ’s perspective of a porous boundary that made advances by the working class and society dependent on unions defending social justice. This idea is perhaps most evident in Julius Jacobson’s stirring defense of student radicals against their critics on the left “In Defense of the Young ” in which he defended the importance of the working class and unions while criticizing their social conservatism. Given the horrific spectacle of working-class support for Trump and white supremacy in the recent election the arguments Jacobson made are even more salient than they were when published the piece in spring 1970 and therefore are worth quoting at length: Who among us was not shocked by the rhetorical and physical violence of New York construction workers in their “spontaneous” assault on children bearded folk and uninvolved bystanders who had the temerity to defend teenagers being beaten by wrench wielding hardhats? Or did not suffer a touch of nausea watching workingmen with brawny arms and shrivelled souls wave Confederate flags and placards declaring affection for Agnew the Establishment and their hatred of peaceniks there are explanations for the workers’ animus toward the peace movement and toward blacks. Although white workers generally enjoy a higher living standard today they are not economically or psychologically secure. They have no real future they lack education and inner resources and many people do look on them as inferiors. In other times and under other circumstances the ensuing bitterness could explode and overflow into rebellious and socially constructive channels. For reasons we need not explore here that is obviously not the case today. Instead as a form of compensation they begin to look upon themselves as pillars of society seeking to overcome the insufficiency of their lives through an identification with the most conservative myths and prejudices that make up the American way of life. These attitudes are reinforced by their union officials whose one source of dismay is that too many rank-and-filers are then enchanted by Wallace Nixon and Buckley instead of Johnson and Rahm Emanuel” for “Johnson Humphrey and Daley” to make Jacobson’s analysis more current. The rest of the piece eviscerates arguments of intellectuals especially Irving Howe and the “democratic left ” who chastised youthful protesters while encouraging validation of the most dangerous “desperadoes”—those in the Democratic Party. So much of the discussion is relevant today I can only encourage readers to read it for themselves. However what is germane in this article to my analysis is Jacobson’s explicit rejection of what was Benson’s trajectory the path of “older people who were radical or revolutionary in their youth but and frustrated over the failure of independent socialist politics have moved in an increasingly rightward direction discovering en route all sorts of wondrous things in liberal (and not so liberal) institutions and values.” (6) The Jacobsons retained the WP and ISL ideals of revolutionary opposition to capitalism and communism as well as the role of the working class in those struggles. One sees in through the years adumbration of the Third Camp even when the analysis isn’t presented as such. In contrast to the defense of socialist ideals in Benson’s almost messianic belief in the solitary role of union democracy and democratized unions seems his own “mystical consolation” for the Third Camp. Although he doesn’t identify it as such Jacobson’s proposal to the young outlines the contours of the Third Camp and it is noteworthy that this includes the fight for social justice as inseparable from the struggle for union democracy: I propose: 1) that the young devote a considerable portion of their energies to building a new radical party in this country completely independent of the two capitalist parties; 2) that the young reach out intelligently to the working class—from within the trade union movement and without—supporting their economic struggles and countering the conservative influences of the labor bureaucracy; 3) that they continue to demand the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of all American troops from Indochina; 4) that they protest the monstrous mistreatment of the Black Panthers the manner in which the past Democratic Administration tolerated and the present Nixon Administration encourages the extermination of the Panthers and the assaults on their organization; 5) that they fight for community control of the schools which means to wage a struggle against the reactionary Shanker leadership of the United Federation of Teachers a leadership which appeals to the basest prejudices of its most backward members for support; 6) that they commit themselves to a consistent revolutionary struggle for democracy—i.e. to socialism—with the realization that all forms of totalitarianism (Russian Chinese or Cuban) are no less the enemy of socialism than capitalist imperialism. (9) too many articles for me to name elaborates the idea that union democracy and social justice are inseparable in the fight for socialism. Without realizing it Benson himself explains why this is the case. Conceptualizing the new historically unique configuration of economic and political arrangements in Russia as a new which the WP called “bureaucratic collectivism ” and its symbiotic relationship with capitalism recentered the concept of capitalism as a social system not only a set of property and political arrangements about which Marx was clear. Forms of social oppression are embedded in capitalism (and other class societies) so there is no separating the fight for democracy in unions—and society—from struggles against racism and the new forms of injustice social movements emerge to fight. We often see the natural affinity of social justice and economic issues when workers consider forming unions to protect their interests. Even the as seen in this letter to the workplace adviser in the “Business” section: I worked in the outdoor adventure industry as a multiday river guide. For many it’s a dream job—living outside in beautiful places adventuring on big whitewater. However the rosy outside perspectives are underlain by the same plagues of the regular work force: unreliable schedules What advice do you have for starting a union in a nontraditional workplace? There is excitement among the guides The stirrings of opposition to oppression are often molecular occurring without being apparent to those not closely involved—until resistance crystallizes in political actions often protests and demonstrations. Arguments such as Benson’s that union reform must take up “class” demands first ignore much history most recently the origins of the 2018 teacher walkouts in activists’ work in social movements outside of labor. Fusing social justice concerns with creating democratic unions is complex and difficult a work in process that is never complete. But one key is learning how to cast struggles so they are seen as a function of workers’ self-interest not allowing them to become competing demands for scarce resources. Discussing how that can be done is urgent but the starting point is taking up the challenge.

Desde entonces más de 136 millones de personas han empleado nuestro website para saber de Historia haciendo de él una de las publicaciones online de historia más leídas en el mundo. Nuestro proyecto ha sido premiado internacionalmente y es reconocido por prestigiosas instituciones de enseñanza. “Ancient History Encyclopedia” es hoy en día un nombre “brand” bien establecido incluso más allá de los círculos especializados/académicos. (Historia). hemos cubierto la mayoría de temas del Mundo de la Antiguedad una porción significante referente a la Medieval y justo ahora hemos comenzado la redacción sobre Historia Colonial y la temprana Europa Moderna. Nuestra publicación ya no trata exclusivamente sobre tópicos de la Antiguedad sino que cubre cada vez más temas históricos más recientes. ¡Hemos sobrepasado a nuestro nombre! Ha llegado entonces el momento de “re-nombrarnos” (rebrand) y cambiar el nuestro a “ World History Encyclopedia” (Enciclopedia de la Historia Mundial) titulo que refleja mejor a nuestra organización y sus aspiraciones. Este reajuste monumental requerirá varios meses comenzando por el cambio al nuevo nombre esta semana. En principio seguiremos usando nuestro muy amado y ampliamente reconocido nombre de dominio (domain name) ancient.eu el cual dentro de unos pocos meses pasará a ser: worldhistory.org. Simultáneamente estamos en el proceso de incorporación de una organización benéfica (charity -NGO?) en el Reino Unido la cual será propietaria de la publicación y de todos los aspectos relativos a la propiedad intelectual que deriven de la misma. Por supuesto que ningún “rebranding” está completo…¡sin un nuevo logo!. Así que el mismo fue diseñado por Dorothee Olivereau una diseñadora gráfica francesa. Durante el proceso de diseño quisimos asegurarnos que el nuevo logo reflejara el hecho de que el “rebranding” era una continuación de la Enciclopedia de Historia de la Antiguedad ( Ancient History Encyclopedia). Por tal razón decidimos escoger una figura y composicion (layout) similar (al anterior?). Los símbolos en el interior del cuadrado rojo están inspirados en la escritura la más antigua conocida hasta ahora…y si la escritura cuneiforme representa a la historia más temprana del mundo entonces un website como el nuestro lo hace para la más reciente y nosotros aquí cubriremos todo entre ambas. Además un símbolo cuneiforme representando a la escritura per se (como tal) resulta bastante apropiado para relacionarlo con una enciclopedia. La otra figura simulando una flecha en su porción central nos remite al símbolo de “play” que encontramos en los dispositivos electrónicos y reproductores multimedia lo cual resalta el aspecto de ‘medio digital’ de la Enciclopedia; y a la vez guía nuestra vista hacia la derecha señalando la ruta y alcance desde nuestro orígenes antiguos hasta … (la actualidad).

1620765123.964494,66254797,https://catto.ushistory.org/catto-and-american-civil-rights/philadelphia-and-americas-civil-rights-legacy/,Philadelphia and America’s Civil Rights Legacy Catto and His Times and Leadership Amy Cohen’s Catto the Forgotten Hero Philadelphia and America’s Civil Rights Legacy (Top image from the core exhibit of the African American Museum of Philadelphia) Although frequently overshadowed by New York City Philadelphia offers an important lens for studying America’s national heritage around civil rights. In addition to being the birth place of the Declaration of Independence and the formation of the national government Philadelphia in the 19th century was a prominent urban center that had strong Southern sentiments and alliances and was a hot bed of ethnic immigrant and nativist tensions. At the time that the city was home to the largest free black community above the Mason Dixon Line it also had growing immigrant populations from many countries and cultures and rising new industrial and civic leaders. The city was the setting of what America had become social and political tensions of 19th century Philadelphia reflect America’s continuing challenges today. The city also became an important place where Martin Luther King Jr. was educated and built alliances for his 20th Century civil rights efforts. Consequently Philadelphia provides a framework for both comparative study and civic learning to explore a more comprehensive view of America’s civil rights narrative. historian Gary Nash published his groundbreaking work on Philadelphia’s early free black community Forging Freedom: The Formation of Philadelphia’s Black Community The book examines America’s earliest large free back community in the North. It reveals the civil rights struggles this community faced to build both families and community and define their place in America. Their journey was a turbulent one as Philadelphia free blacks organized churches established neighborhoods and social networks sought education for their children and built political consciousness and economic competency. Importantly also the community cultivated strong leaders among their ranks who not only worked to abolish slavery but also fight for citizenship rights that were often fleeting. Before Nash the telling of their story was often focused on abolition. However abolition was but one part of the critical issues of their concern. Philadelphia the “City of Brotherly Love” was not so “brotherly” when it came to its black citizens. William Wells Brown a frequent visitor to the city said: “Colorphobia is more rampant here (in Philadelphia) than in the pro-slavery negro-hating city of New York.” Most early black residents of Philadelphia believed that they had a legitimate claim as Americans in the United States. Many were newly emancipated…some had relatives still held in bondage which kept them connected to slavery and the abolition cause. However as free people in the North they themselves faced many other challenges due to racism and segregation in Philadelphia and the country that Wells Brown observed. Even the more fortunate of them found their voting rights stripped away when the Pennsylvania legislature took away black voting rights for those who met the property requirements. The 1838 Pennsylvania Constitutional convention was originally held with the primary goal of reforming tax and ownership restrictions placed on voting in order to enable the impoverished citizens of Pennsylvania to vote. However intense political turmoil targeted black Philadelphia and thousands of white citizens petitioned the convention to restrict suffrage to “white freemen” only. Leaving blacks with financial means being taxed without representation. The community was also confronted with attempts by the American Colonization Society to repatriate free blacks back to Africa. Colonization was strongly rejected by black Philadelphians in 1817 at a meeting drawing over 3 000 at Mother Bethel church. By 1830 Philadelphia free blacks joined with free blacks in other northern American communities and formed an activist network known as the Negro Convention Movement through which they focused their political and civil rights consciousness. In 1831 Philadelphia was the host site of the first convention convening. The recent rediscovery Octavius Valentine Catto who was in the second generation of free blacks in Philadelphia after Forten brings to light the frequently neglected connection between America’s civil rights stories of the earlier period and the subsequent struggles in the 20th and in current centuries. This long arc of the civil rights history is often treated as separate occurrences not broadly within a long timeline. This portal seeks to correct this presentation by undertaking to reveal the networks that African Americans built across the nation Octavius Valentine Catto was a 19th century African American civil rights activist whose short life spanned the thirty-one years preceding the Civil War and the early part of Reconstruction America. He and his peers are representative of the subsequent young leadership that was built within the community. They are also the generation that came to adult life in the decisive years that our nation as whole tested what equality and citizenship should really mean. For Catto’s generation of black men the Civil War provided the pivotal moment for shifting the meaning of the U.S. Constitution. Historian Eric Foner calls this time The shift was not just in the ways blacks would be defined by federal and state laws and seek opportunity. It was a shift in defining the meaning of citizenship and equality for everyone. And it is what we are grappling still with today. Pennsylvania were crucial in effecting this change and Catto was among the leaders Although there was great hope for a “new day” in America among Catto and his associates their efforts also deepened racial tensions that led to Jim Crow laws as well as anti-black violence and intimidation in both the North and the South in the years following the Civil War. As these regressive actions and forces grew African Americans and their white allies formed new civil rights and social service organizations in an effort to advance the ideals of equality citizenship and opportunity. Philadelphia also served as an important center for this activity. It is the intent of the city’s civic leaders and the Catto Memorial Fund for the Catto Memorial at City Hall to be a catalyst for focusing attention to this story.

The George Inn at Norton St Philip (above) claims to have had a licence to serve ale from 1397 and identifies itself as Britain’s oldest tavern! The George has a long and interesting history. The diarist passed through here on his way to from Salisbury. Later in 1685 during the the inn was used as the headquarters of his army as they retreated from Bath. After the rebellion failed the infamous Judge Jefferies used the inn as a courtroom during the Bloody Assizes; twelve people were then taken and executed on the village common. the Old Bell Hotel at Malmesbury (pictured above) lays claim to this title. The hotel dates from 1220 and is reputed to be England’s oldest purpose-built hotel. Situated adjacent to the magnificent 12th Century abbey it was originally used as a guest house for visiting monks. Part of the hotel may have been built on the abbey churchyard and the hotel is indeed reputed to be haunted by is the epitome of a smugglers’ inn with cellars built in Norman times and secret passageways in some of its rooms.

We should let Miguel Cardona know we have his back if he defends what schools students really need – while we simultaneously prepare for his not doing so. Teachers unions and the pandemic: Fighting for life and facing neoliberalism’s new bipartisan push Biden will endorse the old normal Obama handed to Trump but he will also push profiteering and control of education through technology a project supported by both Democrats and the GOP from the start of Trump’s administration. Say #ByeBetsy – and organize now to fight against Biden’s education policies Biden’s victory now requires confronting his advocacy of disastrous education policies during the Obama administration enacted under Obama’s Secretary of Education Fighting for teachers unions that speak back to power defend students and social justice School reopenings have become a point of political conflict on a national level and teachers’ rights to have healthy equitable schools have been subordinated to the bipartisan consensus to put the economy and profit over human need. Firing Up the House of Labor to Fight for Racial Justice: Confronting Hard Truths Defending truths about union democracy and the inseparability of racial and economic justice in our society has shown to be extraordinarily demanding work yet it is an unavoidable goal if the organized power of the working class is to (help) free the human race. Building an Alternative to the Democratic Party Bernie Sanders has ended his candidacy Philly Educators Have a Chance to Make History Members of the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers (PFT) have a chance to improve lives of Philly school educators and students challenging control of schools by corporate elites as did Chicago teachers when they elected a new generation of leaders from  . . . The New York Times obituary of neocon historian Gertrude Himmelfarb shows why  neoconservatives remain a potent political force in U.S. politics: many liberals can’t imagine a socialist challenge to capitalism that doesn’t apologize for authoritarianism. Parents’ huge stake in the Chicago Teachers Union strike A harsh reality of teachers’ strikes is that they hit parents – moms especially who still do most of the work of caring for kids and housework – the hardest. Parents are left frantically searching for childcare options especially if  . . . Education Workers in Chicago Are Challenging the U.S. Ruling Class Though the media is casting the strike of education workers in the Chicago Public Schools as (just) another episode in the wave of teachers’ strikes and the press in Chicago is doing its best to defeat the union this contract  . . .

He aims to tell the stories of the walkouts  . . . What LA Teachers Have Already Won The United Teachers of Los Angeles (UTLA) has now reentered negotiations with a school board chastened by a strike that has shown the movement’s political power in massive demonstrations with community members and parents. Why the LA Teachers Strike Matters announced by the United Teachers of Los Angeles (UTLA) has heightened tensions in an already contentious dispute with Los Angeles Superintendent Austin Beutner who represents the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) in negotiations.

Liberal fear about teaching a ""people's history"": Sam Wineburg on Howard Zinn The Zinn Education Project has published to an article based on Sam Wineburg’s book Walkouts Teach U.S. Labor a New Grammar for Struggle (New Politics Vol. XVII No. 1 the U.S. “Education Spring” was an explosive wave of protests. Statewide teacher walkouts seemed to arise out of nowhere with demands for increased school funding and political voice for teachers. Though the walkouts confounded national media outlets which had little idea how to explain or report on the movements for parent and teacher activists who have been organizing against reforms in public education over the past four decades if unexpected. What was surprising was their breadth of support (statewide) and their breathtakingly rapid spread. and the fall of the Berlin Wall Reflecting on the days I spent as a delegate during the AFT national convention in Pittsburgh (held July 13-16) I was reminded of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of Soviet Communism in 1989-90. No one predicted it and it seemed to come out of nowhere. But peace activists in the West who organized international support for struggles of dissidents in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe saw the social ferment. Walkouts teach U.S. labor a new grammar for struggle This article will appear in the Summer 2018 issue of New Politics. #FreeRider and #Freeloader obscure labor’s challenges post-Janus The Supreme Court’s long-anticipated – and feared by progressives – decision outlawing the collection of fees in public employee unions equivalent to costs of collective bargaining was met with indignant or defiant words rightly decrying this attack on organized labor. The response has mirrored what has been missing in labor’s understanding of how we got to this point and what we need to climb out An analysis - and homage - to the work of teachers I tag my blogs with key words.

1620765152.103386,1865455,https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/0_(number),"This page is about the number and digit 0 or ""zero."" and a numerical digit used to represent that number in numerals. As a number —an absence of other values. It plays a central role in mathematics as the identity element of the and many other algebraic structures. As a digit zero is used as a placeholder in place value systems. Historically it was the last digit to come into use. In the zero may also be called and follows −1. In most (if not all) numerical systems 0 was identified before the idea of 'negative integers' was accepted. Zero is an integer which quantifies a count or an amount of null size; that is if the number of your brothers is zero that means the same thing as having no brothers and if something has a weight of zero it has no weight. If the difference between the number of pieces in two piles is zero it means the two piles have an equal number of pieces. Before counting starts the result can be assumed to be zero; that is the number of items counted before you count the first item and counting the first item brings the result to one. And if there are no items to be counted zero remains the final result. While mathematicians all accept zero as a number some non-mathematicians would say that zero is not a number arguing one cannot have zero of something. Others hold that if you have a bank balance of zero you have a specific quantity of money in your account namely none. It is that latter view which is accepted by mathematicians and most others. Almost all historians omit the year zero from the proleptic Gregorian and Julian calendars but astronomers include it in these same calendars. However the phrase Year Zero may be used to describe any event considered so significant that it virtually starts a new time reckoning. The modern numeral 0 is normally written as a circle or (rounded) rectangle. In old-style fonts with text figures 0 is usually the same height as a lowercase x. On the seven-segment displays of calculators 0 is usually written with six line segments though on some historical calculator models it was written with four line segments. This variant glyph has not caught on. It is important to distinguish the zero (as in the ""zero brothers"" example above) from the used in numeral systems using positional notation. Successive positions of digits have higher values so the digit zero is used to skip a position and give appropriate value to the preceding and following digits. A zero digit is not always necessary in a positional number system: bijective numeration provides a possible counterexample. comes through the Arabic literal translation of the already meant ""west wind"" in Latin; the proper noun Zephyrus was the Roman god of the west wind (after the Greek god Zephyros). With its new use for the concept of zero zephyr came to mean a light breeze—""an giving the modern English word. decimal zero and its new mathematics spread from the Arab world to Europe in the as well as to privileged knowledge and secret codes. According to Ifrah a 'worthless fellow' was called a… The Arabic root gave rise to the modern French encrypted; as well as to the English word Note that zero in Greek is translated as 0 (zero) was the last numerical digit to come into use the Babylonians had a sophisticated sexagesimal (base-60) positional numeral system. The lack of a positional value (or zero) was indicated by a a punctuation symbol (two slanted wedges) was co-opted as a placeholder in the same Babylonian system. In a tablet unearthed at Kish (dating from perhaps as far back as 700 the scribe Bêl-bân-aplu wrote his zeroes with three hooks rather than two slanted wedges. The Babylonian placeholder was not a true zero because it was not used alone. Nor was it used at the end of a number. Thus numbers like 2 and 120 (2×60) etc. looked the same because the larger numbers lacked a final sexagesimal placeholder. Only context could differentiate them. seemed unsure about the status of zero as a number: they asked themselves ""How can nothing be something? religious arguments about the nature and existence of zero and the depend in large part on the uncertain interpretation of zero. (The ancient Greeks even questioned that Early use of something like zero by the implied at first glance by his use of binary numbers is only the modern binary representation using 0 and 1 applied to Pingala's binary system which used short and long syllables (the latter equal in length to two short syllables) he and other Indian scholars at the time used the after a series of transliterations and a literal translation) to refer to zero or The back of Stela C from Tres Zapotes This is the second oldest Long Count date yet discovered. The numerals 7.16.6.16.18 translate to September 32 (Julian). The glyphs surrounding the date are what is thought to be one of the few surviving examples of Epi-Olmec script. The Long Count calendar developed in south-central required the use of zero as a place-holder within its vigesimal (base-20) positional numeral system. A shell glyph— —was used as a zero symbol for these Long Count dates the earliest of which (on Stela 2 at Chiapa de Corzo Chiapas) has a date of 36 Since the eight earliest Long Count dates appear outside the it is assumed that the use of zero in the Americas predated the Maya and was possibly the invention of the many of the earliest Long Count dates were found within the Olmec heartland although the fact that the Olmec civilization had come to an end by the fourth century several centuries before the earliest known Long Count dates argues against the zero being an Olmec invention. Although zero became an integral part of Maya numerals it of course did not influence Old World numeral systems. was using a symbol for zero (a small circle with a long overbar) within a sexagesimal numeral system otherwise using alphabetic Greek numerals. Because it was used alone not just as a placeholder this Hellenistic zero was perhaps the first zero in the Old World. However the positions were usually limited to the fractional part of a number (called minutes etc.)—they were not used for the Another zero was used in tables alongside Roman numerals by 525 (first known use by Dionysius Exiguus) not as a symbol. When division produced zero as a remainder was used. These medieval zeros were used by all future medieval computists (calculators of ). An isolated use of their initial was used in a table of Roman numerals by The oldest known text to use zero is the Jain text from The first indubitable appearance of a symbol for zero appears in 876 in India on a stone tablet in Gwalior. Documents on copper plates with the same small o in them dated back as far as the sixth century The rules governing the use of zero appeared for the first time in the book written in 628 by Brahmagupta (598-670). Here Brahmagupta considers not only zero but also negative numbers and the algebraic rules for the elementary operations of arithmetic with such numbers. In some instances his rules differ from the modern standard. Brahamagupta's rules are given below: The sum of two positive quantities is positive The sum of two negative quantities is negative The sum of zero and a negative number is negative The sum of a positive number and zero is positive The sum of zero and zero is zero The sum of a positive and a negative is their difference; or the less is to be taken from the greater the less is to be taken from the greater is subtracted from the less When positive is to be subtracted from negative they must be added together The product of a negative quantity and a positive quantity is negative The product of a negative quantity and a negative quantity is positive Positive divided by positive or negative by negative is positive Positive divided by negative is negative. Negative divided by positive is negative A positive or negative number when divided by zero is a fraction with the zero as denominator Zero divided by a negative or positive number is either zero or is expressed as a fraction with zero as numerator and the finite quantity as denominator Zero divided by zero is zero In saying ""zero divided by zero is zero "" Brahmagupta differs from the modern position. Mathematicians normally do not assign a value whereas computers and calculators will sometimes assign NaN which means ""not a number."" Moreover non-zero positive or negative numbers when divided by zero are either assigned no value or a value of unsigned infinity or negative infinity. Once again these assignments are not numbers and are associated more with computer science than pure mathematics where in most contexts no assignment is made. (See division by zero) Positional notation without the use of zero (using an empty space in tabular arrangements ""emptiness"") is known to have been in use in from the sixth century. The earliest certain use of zero as a positional digit dates to the ninth century. The glyph for the zero digit was written in the shape of a dot The Hindu-Arabic numeral system reached Europe in the eleventh century via the Iberian Peninsula through first imported by Gerbert of Aurillac (c. 940-1003). They came to be known as ""Arabic numerals."" The Italian mathematician * was instrumental in bringing the system into European mathematics in 1202. Here as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art to the nine digits of the Hindus the knowledge of the art very much appealed to me before all others and for it I realized that all its aspects were studied in Egypt with their varying methods… But all this even as well as the art of Pythagoras I considered as almost a mistake in respect to the method of the Hindus. The nine Indian figures are: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. With these nine figures and with the sign 0 … any number may be written. Here Leonardo of Pisa uses the word sign ""0 "" indicating it is like a sign to do operations like addition or multiplication but he did not recognize zero as a number in its own right. Zero (0) is the lowest non-negative . The natural number following zero is and no natural number precedes zero. Zero may or may not be counted as a natural number depending on the definition of natural numbers. the number zero is the cardinality of the empty set: if one does not have any apples then one has zero apples. Therefore Zero is neither positive nor negative neither a prime number nor a composite number nor is it a unit. The following are some basic rules for dealing with the number zero. These rules apply for any complex number 0 is an identity element with respect to addition.) because 0 has no multiplicative inverse a consequence of the previous rule. For positive its quotient increases toward positive infinity the quotient increases toward negative infinity. The different quotients confirms that division by zero is undefined. = 0 may be left undefined in some contexts. For all positive real The sum of 0 numbers is 0 and the product of 0 numbers is 1. The expression ""0/0"" is an ""indeterminate form."" That does not simply mean that it is undefined; rather ) could approach any finite number or ∞ or −∞; it depends on which functions Zero is the identity element in an additive group or the additive identity of a ring. A zero of a function is a point in the domain of the function whose image under the function is zero. When there are finitely many zeros these are called the roots of the function. See zero (complex analysis). The concept of ""almost"" impossible in probability. More generally the concept of almost nowhere in measure theory. For instance: if one chooses a point on a unit line interval [0 but the probability that you will is zero. A zero function (or zero map) is a constant function with 0 as its only possible output value; i.e. defined. A particular zero function is a zero morphism in category theory; e.g. a zero map is the identity in the additive group of functions. The determinant on non-invertible square matrices is a zero map. Zero is one of three possible return values of the Möbius function. Passed an integer of the form the Möbius function returns zero. Zero is the first Perrin number. The value zero plays a special role for a large number of physical quantities. For some quantities the zero level is naturally distinguished from all other levels whereas for others it is more or less arbitrarily chosen. For example zero is the coldest possible temperature (negative temperatures exist but are not actually colder) zero is arbitrarily defined to be at the of water. Measuring sound intensity in decibels or phons the zero level is arbitrarily set at a reference value—for example at a value for the threshold of hearing. Zero has been proposed as the atomic number of the theoretical element tetraneutronium. It has been shown that a cluster of four may be stable enough to be considered an in their own right. This would create an As early as 1926 Professor Andreas von Antropoff coined the term neutronium for a conjectured form of made up of neutrons with no protons which he placed as the chemical element of atomic number zero at the head of his new version of the . It was subsequently placed as a noble gas in the middle of several spiral representations of the periodic system for classifying the chemical elements. It is at the center of the Chemical Galaxy (2005). The most common practice throughout human history has been to start counting at one. Nevertheless zero has become the standard starting point. For example in almost all old programming languages by default. As programming languages have developed it has become more common that an array starts from zero by default the ""first"" item in the array being item 0. In particular the popularity of the programming language ""C"" in the 1980s has made this approach common. One reason for this convention is that modular arithmetic normally describes a set of N numbers as containing 0 … N-1 in order to contain the additive identity. Because of this many arithmetic concepts (such as hash tables) are less elegant to express in code unless the array starts at zero. counting from zero improves the efficiency of various such as in searching or sorting arrays. Improved efficiency means that the algorithm takes either less time to complete a given task. This situation can lead to some confusion in terminology. In a zero-based indexing scheme the first element is ""element number zero""; likewise the twelfth element is ""element number eleven."" Therefore an analogy from the ordinal numbers to the quantity of objects numbered appears; the highest index of n objects will be (n-1) and referred to the n:th element. For this reason the first element is often referred to as the element to eliminate any possible doubt. In databases a field can have a null value. This is equivalent to the field not having a value. For numeric fields it is not the value zero. For text fields this is not blank nor the empty string. The presence of null values leads to three-valued logic. No longer is a condition either true or false but it can be undetermined. Any computation including a null value delivers a null result. Asking for all records with value 0 or value not equal 0 will not yield all records since the records with value null are excluded. is a pointer in a computer program that does not point to any object or function which means that when it appears in a program or code it tells the computer to take no action on the associated portion of the code. In some signed number representations (but not the two's complement representation predominant today) and most floating point number representations zero has two distinct representations one grouping it with the positive numbers and one with the negatives; this latter representation is known as negative zero. Representations with negative zero can be troublesome because the two zeros will compare equal but may be treated differently by some operations. The oval-shaped zero and circular letter O together came into use on modern character displays. The zero with a dot in the center seems to have originated as an option on IBM 3270 controllers (this has the problem that it looks like the Greek letter Theta). The slashed zero looking identical to the letter O other than the slash is used in old-style ASCII graphic sets descended from the default typewheel on the venerable ASR-33 Teletype. This format causes problems because of its similarity to the symbol ∅ as well as for certain Scandinavian languages which use Ø as a letter. The convention which has the letter O with a slash and the zero without was used at IBM and a few other early mainframe makers; this is even more problematic for because it means two of their letters collide. Some Burroughs/Unisys equipment displays a zero with a slash. And yet another convention common on early line printers left zero unornamented but added a tail or hook to the letter-O so that it resembled an inverted Q or cursive capital letter-O. The typeface used on some European number plates for distinguish the two symbols by making the zero rather egg-shaped and the O more circular but most of all by slitting open the zero on the upper right side so the circle is not closed any more (as in German plates). The typeface chosen is called meaning ""unfalsifiable script."" Note that those used in the do not differentiate between the two as there can never be any ambiguity if the design is correctly spaced. In paper writing one may not distinguish the 0 and O at all or may add a slash across it in order to show the difference although this sometimes causes ambiguity in regard to the symbol for the null set. The importance of the creation of the zero mark can never be exaggerated. This giving to airy nothing not merely a local habitation and a name is the characteristic of the Hindu race from whence it sprang. It is like coining the into dynamos. No single mathematical creation has been more potent for the general on-go of intelligence and power. …a profound and important idea which appears so simple to us now that we ignore its true merit. But its very simplicity and the great ease which it lent to all computations put our arithmetic in the first rank of useful inventions. The point about zero is that we do not need to use it in the operations of daily life. No one goes out to buy zero fish. It is in a way the most civilized of all the cardinals and its use is only forced on us by the needs of cultivated modes of thought. …a fine and wonderful refuge of the divine spirit—almost an amphibian between being and non-being. International maritime signal flag for 0 dialing 0 on a telephone places a call for operator assistance. the numeral 0 has the same dot configuration as the letter J. that can be played in any region are sometimes referred to as being ""region 0"" 0 is very rarely used as a number for a composition the only two examples on the fringes of the standard repertoire probably being Anton Bruckner's Symphony No. 0 in D minor and Alfred Schnittke's Symphony No. 0 The Universal History of Numbers: From Prehistory to the Invention of the Computer The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero with information from scholarly article by B. van Nooten ""Binary Numbers in Indian Antiquity"" 21 (1993): 31-50.

1620765165.187126,77472516,https://pc.net/news/2017-11-10/apple_iphone_x_review,Why I Returned the iPhone X I feel like I broke up with a girl because someone better came along.  A few days later I missed my ex and realized my mistake.  Fortunately my ex hadn't moved on and was willing to take me back.  I said goodbye to the iPhone X today and am happily reunited with my iPhone 7. ❤️ Before I explain why I didn't like the iPhone X let me first say it is an amazing phone.  Even my 7 might understand its allure.  The X is easily the fastest iPhone I have used.  The apps open rapidly and the scrolling is silky smooth.  The resolution of the OLED screen is amazing and it has better contrast than any of my previous iPhones.  The X's built-in speakers are noticeably louder and produce a fuller sound than those in the 7. introduced with the iPhone X is incredible.  It works in the dark and when I'm wearing sunglasses.  I can be looking directly at the phone or at an angle and it still works.  More importantly it doesn't work when anyone else uses it.  Face ID is an amazing technological achievement. So why did I return the iPhone X? There were a few things that bothered by about the iPhone X which got more annoying over the course of the week. at the top of the screen.  It didn't annoy me as much as I thought it might but it still did.  The black bar looks fine on the home screen but in certain apps like Mail and Safari it looks strange.  I would share a screenshot to show you what I mean the screen is wider (longer) than a 16x9 display so the notch does not cover standard videos.  Below is a StarCraft video playing on YouTube as an example.  Notice the black bars on each side of the screenshot. but it's not always practical.  When I'm working my phone is almost always on my desk behind my .  If I want to check something on my phone I just tap the home button to log in.  I don't even have to move my phone.  With the iPhone X I have to pick it up or lean over awkwardly and look at my phone.  If I don't lean over enough Face ID fails and I have to log in with my passcode.  Call this a first world problem but it's annoying when I do this several times a day. This is different than no Touch ID.  Since there is no home button on the iPhone X you now have to swipe up from the bottom of the screen to go home from an app.  In some apps there is a button at the bottom of the screen which I accidentally pressed a few times while trying to go home.  Fortunately I didn't like anything by accident on but I figured it was only a matter of time.  I tried to get used to swiping to go home I still didn't like it. The iPhone X is a clunky phone.  This caught me by surprise.  While it's only slightly larger than the iPhone 7 it is significantly heavier.  It felt like a brick when I was holding it.  I tried to get used to the weight over the past few days but the more I tried the more I missed my 7.  A transition from the 7 Plus to the X would be much easier.  But I like a sleek phone and the X is not sleek. Notch on the top of the display I've owned an iPhone since the first day the first iPhone was released .  This would have been my seventh one.  I felt sad as I returned the X to my local Apple Store though I must say the store employees could not have been more friendly and helpful with the return process.  I'll miss the X's dual camera (especially Portrait mode) and the built-in speaker ▶ The fact that I lost all my activity data from the day I transitioned to the X made me a little less sad to return the phone.  It abruptly ended my ~300 day stand streak and there was nothing I could do about it.  I recommend syncing your Apple Watch with your new phone in the morning because even when you sync the watch with your most recent backup you still lose all your activity data for that day.  It happened again today when I reverted to the 7. I hope I am part of a small minority of people who decide to return the X.  If lots of other people feel the same way about the iPhone X it could be a big blow to Apple.  For now I'm back with my ex (not the X) and things are good.  Plus she's slimmer and better looking.

1620765177.3397331,45999828,https://newpol.org/issue_post/the-techniques-of-justice/,"Orwell and Camus on a Hanging and the Guillotine (New Politics Vol. XVIII No. 2 George Orwell once imagined “a remarkable anthology” consisting entirely “of pieces of writing describing executions.” He supposed “There must be hundreds of them scattered through literature.” Without looking into the question he could immediately cite examples from Zola A Tale of Two Cities “a letter or diary of Byron’s a Jack London short story “Plato’s account of the death of Socrates ” and “a great number of specimens in verse for instance the old hanging ballads.” Naturally Orwell would himself supply a worthy contribution to such a collection “A Hanging.” That short piece recounts an execution in Burma for which Orwell was present as part of his job in the police. The largest portion of the essay concerns the walk from the cells to the gallows with the condemned man surrounded by guards. The fatal event is itself described but briefly and without drama. Then a closing scene portrays the uncomfortable moments after the execution the guards and police standing around clearly unsettled but trying not to act it. “Several people laughed “There was no question that everybody concerned knew this to be a dreadful must be common among any who witness an execution and its effect is apparent in the literature. “The thing that I think very striking is that no one or no one I can remember ever writes of an execution . The dominant note is always horror.” the “newspapers … smacking their chops over the bumping-off of wretched quislings” after the war—are almost certainly produced by people who “had not had to watch the actual deed.” Albert Camus made much the same point in his essay “Reflections on the Guillotine”: “The man who enjoys his coffee while reading that justice has been done would spit it out at the least detail.” Camus begins his essay by recalling the time that his father attended a public execution. It was the execution of a field hand who had “slaughtered a family of farmers” in Algiers “including the children.” The elder Camus “was especially aroused by the murder of children ” and “thought that decapitation was too mild a punishment for such a monster.” And yet to witness the actual event disturbed him greatly. “What he saw that morning he never told anyone. My mother related merely that he came rushing home lay down for a moment on the bed and suddenly began to vomit.” Camus and Orwell both understood that the justification for state violence depends on a sort of abstraction of describing it in such a way as to not convey too specific an image of the actual event. In his essay “Politics and the English Language political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible. … Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism and sheer cloudy vagueness. Defenseless villages are bombarded from the air the inhabitants driven out into the countryside the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets: This is called . Millions of peasants are robbed of their farms and sent trudging along the roads with no more than they can carry: This is called . People are imprisoned for years without trial or shot in the back of the neck or sent to die of scurvy in Arctic lumber camps: This is called . Such phraseology is needed if one wants to name things without calling up mental pictures of them. Camus likewise thought that “officials and journalists … have made up a sort of ritual language reduced to stereotyped phrases. Hence we read at breakfast time in a corner of the newspaper that the condemned ‘has paid his debt to society’ or that he has ‘atoned’ or that ‘at five a.m. justice was done.’” Orwell knew from close observation the awful reality that such phrases covered over and his experience in the Imperial Police left him with “an indescribable loathing of the whole machinery of so-called justice.” and the force of “A Hanging” depends exactly on such details even very minor ones. He tells of the prisoner stepping around a puddle a fact that pressed home “what it means to destroy a healthy conscious man”: “this man was not dying he was alive just as we were alive”—yet in a few minutes’ time he would no longer be. It is the details that allow us to see the incident as it is—at scale so to speak. They reduce its dramatic effect and show it neither as a great tragedy nor as an exemplary act of justice but as a senseless piece of cruelty Camus uses a similar technique in “The Guest.” In that story a teacher in a remote Algerian village is pressed into service transporting a prisoner to a nearby town where he is to be tried for murder. Only a couple of lines describe his crime stands for his punishment. Instead of the gruesome murder the story is concerned with the small involuntary intimacies that the two men share during their brief time together—the eating ” the protagonist is haunted by a feeling of complicity with the machinery of punishment and in the background of each story there looms the context of colonialism. Reflecting on his time in the police Orwell later commented on the impossibility of justice when the authority responsible for administering it is not considered legitimate: “The thief whom we put in prison did not think of himself as a criminal justly punished he thought of himself as the victim of a foreign conqueror. The thing that was done to him was merely a wanton meaningless cruelty.” ” there are rumors of a planned revolt among the Arabs and the danger that the suspect’s kinsmen will try to free him. At the end the teacher refuses to hand over the prisoner. He walks him to a kind of crossroads and offers him a choice: One path leads to the village and prison; the other leads to a tribe of nomads who will hide him—freedom but at the price of exile. The Arab walks away to accept his punishment. The teacher returns home to find a threat: “You handed over our brother. You will pay for this.” It is a perfect absurdist parable. One man given the choice between prison and exile chooses prison. The other finds himself conscripted over his objections and condemned without regard to his actions; the defining moment of choice ultimately makes no difference. The moral outlook is almost Christian. We are all equally guilty. We share in the crime of the murderer and we share in the crime of the society that punishes him. as the murderer does when he chooses the path of judgment; or we can refuse it as the schoolmaster does when he leaves the prisoner at the crossroads. But in either case Camus undoubtedly viewed this tale as a portrait of the human condition. But it can also be read as a critique of colonialism as a system destructive of human freedom and corrupting to all it touches. Orwell wrote about the difficulty of escaping the logic of colonialism once one has become enmeshed in it. Another essay reflecting on his time in the Imperial Police he was dispatched to respond to an elephant that had gone rogue and killed a villager. By the time Orwell finds the beast but nevertheless a crowd had gathered and feeling the pressure of their attention—“two thousand wills pressing me forward —Orwell decides at last that he has no choice but to shoot the animal. Likewise at the end of his novel a white timber merchant in Burma realizes that he is—psychologically speaking—alone and lost in a strange and hostile land; he is an alien to the Burmese he has been disgraced in the eyes of the Europeans and he has failed his only real friend an Indian doctor. He depends on the colonial system for everything. It has made him what he is and he hates what he has become. In the end his only escape is through suicide. Each of these pieces of writing is a kind of protest. In terms of theme Orwell’s “Hanging” and Camus’ “Guillotine” are explicitly critical of capital punishment; implicitly ” and “Shooting an Elephant.” Underlying them all is an aesthetic concern with clarity and specificity which turns out to have both an ethical and a political import. By their form and by their technique these stories and essays privilege concrete detail over abstraction and personal experience over ideology and so they also offer a defense of the individual—of individual judgment and individual dignity—as against the impersonal systems of power that constrain us and corrupt us. “As I Please (3 November 1944) ” in Sonia Orwell and Ian Angus Journalism and Letters of George Orwell volume 3: As I Please ” in Sonia Orwell and Ian Angus Journalism and Letters of George Orwell volume 1: An Age Like This “As I Please (3 November 1944) “As I Please (3 November 1944) trans.

If you have bookmarks or links to our site on your blog or website Map of the Roman Empire in 125 CE is the second smallest of the seven continents covering roughly 2% of the earth's surface. The name 'Europe' has long been thought to have been derived from the ancient myth of seeing the lovely Phoenician princess Europa bathing (or playing with her handmaidens) by the seashore transformed himself into a magnificent white bull and slowly approached her from the sea. So gentle and sweet was this bull that Europa placed garlands of flowers around his neck petted him and then climbed onto his back when the bull ran off across the surface of the seas abducting her to the isle of . On Crete Zeus and Europa became lovers and she bore him three famous sons. Her family back in Phonecia sent her brothers in search of her each one finally being unsuccessful in his quest but each founding important and lending their names to various regions around the originally known as Cadmea after Europa's brother Cadmus). does not believe the tale of the Phoenician princess had anything to do with the naming of the continent in Book Four of his Histories “Another thing that puzzles me is why three distinct 's names should have been given to what is really a single land-mass…nobody knows where it got its name from unless we are to say that it came from Europa and before that was nameless like the rest. This is unlikely; for Europa was an Asiatic and never visited the country which we now call Europe.” Theories regarding the origin of the name 'Europe' range from it being of a reference to the breadth of the shoreline as seen from the sea or from the Phoenician for “evening” as in the place where the sun would set. Today as it was in Herodotus' time no one can say for certain where the name 'Europe' originated. To the ancient Greeks the Aegean sea and environs were the center of the world. The Phonecians regularly sailed across and up the Atlantic to harvest tin from Europe at Cornwall but Europe was a dark continent (in the same way that 19th and early 20th century CE Europeans would later view on even the most basic level had been ongoing in Europe since at least 20 000 BCE as evidenced by cave paintings (the most famous being the Cave of complex in modern-day France) and by 5000 BCE hierarchical societies had begun to emerge and peas were cultivated evidence of a sturdy agricultural society. Even so more so than any other non-Greeks were barbarians (from the Greek barbarophonos a word first coined by Book II) who banded together diverse tribes such as the Balts (who included the Gauls and the Germanic tribes). tombs were in use in Europe by 3500 farming was widespread across the face of the continent and by 2000 work was introduced by the Wessex culture of present-day . In 1860 BCE the construction of the impressive and mysterious such accomplishments were not so impressive to the Greeks nor to the Romans. As late as 78 CE refers to the Britons under the governorship of his father-in- scattered and warlike people” to whom the Romans had to bring cultivation and had the same opinion of the Gauls referring to them as little more than animals in his description of the massacre of the Ubii tribe by the Rhine. he devotes as much space to a description of the Alces (elks) of Europe as he does to the Ubii in any important way writing of the elk that “their shape and dappled coat are like those of goats but they are rather larger have stunted horns and legs without joints” and then goes on to give the earliest narrative we have of what would come to be known as “cow tipping” as the Romans would hunt the elk by pushing them over while they slept standing up and killing them easily because they were too large to raise themselves back up. Even so it is impossible to argue that brought nothing of consequence to the people of Europe. The historian Durant writes Sign up for our free weekly email newsletter! For three hundred years Gaul remained a Roman province prospered under the Roman peace learned and transformed the Latin language and became the channel through which the culture of classic antiquity passed into northern Europe. Doubtless neither Caesar nor his contemporaries foresaw the immense consequences of his bloody . He thought he had saved won a province and forged an army; he did not suspect that he was the creator of French civilization. not just to Gaul (later France and part of Italy) but to the whole of Europe providing innovations such as paved roads fortified cities of great administrative efficiency and culture and slowly 'civilizing' the disparate tribes of the various European regions. Tacitus writes of the efforts of Agricola in Britain to establish schools to spread the knowledge of Latin and his encouragement of the populace to build temples and to regard personal hygiene as a matter of importance in the use of public baths. Tacitus continues “By degrees the charms of vice gained admission to British hearts; baths porticoes and elegant banquets grew into vogue; and the new manners which in reality only served to sweeten slavery were by the unsuspecting Britons called the arts of polished humanity.” appreciated Roman culture equally nor accepted its civilizing touch easily as evidenced by the rebellion of Queen of the Iceni tribe (only the most famous among many) in 60/61 CE which resulted in over 70 000 Romans slain by Britons before she was defeated by Paulinus.

It represents a single entity and is commonly regarded as the fundamental unit of counting and measurement. For example a line segment of ""unit length"" is a line segment of length 1. the number 1 is the natural number a number that is used for counting. it is classified as a real number distinguishing it from imaginary numbers. The number 1 is also known as the ""identity element"" of multiplication (or multiplicative identity)—any number multiplied by one is itself. The number one also represents oneness or unity. For example although science is divided into many areas of specialization scientists recognize the unity of the natural world and the underlying unity of the sciences. In the religious world most of today's major religions teach of a single and the importance of unity among people based on our common humanity. Culturally people generally recognize that strength derives from unity and weakness is a product of disunity. Also the number one is a coveted number in practically every competition as the champion is ranked as ""Number One."" The glyph used today in the Western world to represent the number 1 often with a serif at the top and sometimes a short horizontal line at the bottom traces its roots back to the Indians who wrote 1 as a horizontal line as is still the case in Chinese script. The Gupta wrote it as a curved line and the Nagari sometimes added a small circle on the left (rotated a quarter turn to the right this 9-look-alike became the present day numeral 1 in the Gujarati and Punjabi scripts). The Nepali also rotated it to the right but kept the circle small. This eventually became the top serif in the modern numeral but the occasional short horizontal line at the bottom probably originates from similarity with the Roman numeral I. In some European countries (e.g. ) the little serif at the top is sometimes extended into a long upstroke sometimes as long as the vertical line which can lead to confusion with the glyph for in other countries. Where the 1 is written with a long upstroke the number 7 has a horizontal stroke through the vertical line. While the shape of the 1 character has an ascender in most modern typefaces in typefaces with text figures the character usually is of x-height we have 1 + 1 = One cannot be used as the base of a positional numeral system. Sometimes tallying is referred to as ""base 1 "" since only one mark (the tally) is needed but this is not a positional notation. =1 and so has no unique inverse function. 1 can be represented in two ways as a recurring decimal: as 1.000... and as 0.999... In the Von Neumann representation of natural numbers 1 is defined as the {0}. This set has cardinality 1 and hereditary rank 1. Sets like this with a single element are called singletons. 1 is defined as the set of all singletons. In a multiplicative group or monoid the identity element is sometimes denoted ""1 unity) is more traditional. However ""1"" is especially common for the multiplicative identity of a ring. (Note that this multiplicative identity is also often called ""unity"".) and its own square and cube (and so on as 1 × 1 × ... × 1 = 1). One is the first figurate number of every kind pentagonal number and centered hexagonal number to name just a few. It is also the first and second numbers in the Fibonacci sequence and is the first number in many mathematical sequences. As a matter of convention added an initial 1 to any sequence that didn't already have it and considered these initial 1's in its lexicographic ordering. Sloane's later ignore initial ones in their lexicographic ordering of sequences because such initial ones often correspond to trivial cases. One is the smallest positive odd integer. One is a harmonic divisor number. One is often the internal representation of the Boolean constant One is neither a prime number nor a composite number . The fundamental theorem of arithmetic guarantees unique factorization over the integers only up to units ( One was formerly considered prime by some mathematicians using the definition that a prime is divisible only by one and itself. However this complicates the fundamental theorem of arithmetic so modern definitions exclude units. The last professional mathematician to publicly label 1 a prime number was Henri Lebesgue in 1899. One is one of three possible values of the Möbius function: it takes the value one for square-free integers with an even number of distinct prime factors. One is the only odd number in the range of Euler's totient function φ One is the only 1-perfect number (see multiply perfect number). 1 is the magnitude or absolute value of a unit vector and a unit matrix (more usually called an is usually used to mean something quite different. One is the most common leading digit in many sets of data a consequence of Benford's law. Egyptian people used to represent all fractions in terms of sum of fractions with numerator 1 and distinct denominators. For example . Such representations are popularly known as Egyptian Fractions or Unit Fractions. The Generating Function which has all coefficients 1 is given by This power series converges and has finite value if If a number containing only ones (such as 1 and so forth) is multiplied by itself the results are very interesting. such as the unity of the natural world unity of the sciences. For instance studies in ecology demonstrate the interdependence of living organisms with one another and with the inanimate environment thus forming a united whole. In addition other interdisciplinary sciences (such as earth science biochemistry) demonstrate the unity of the sciences. Likewise various technologies play interactive and interdependent roles with one another and with the sciences such as in the development of technologies for transportation which commonly have a valence of +1. Also in the periodic table consists of the two elements hydrogen and The number 1 is the resin identification code used in recycling to identify polyethylene terephthalate. religions teach that there is only one God. Thus all of humanity shares a common Creator making all people part of one human family. This perspective leads to a recognition of the principle of unity. The how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity!"" Thus unity is seen as a valuable goal for humanity. The need for unity is also recognized as a goal with practical value. The aphorism ""United we stand divided we fall"" is often used in team competitions and its value is demonstrated by experience. Also the person or team who is judged to be the best is given the rank of Number One. A natural number is any number that is a positive integer the number 0 is also called a natural number. A cardinal number indicates the quantity of things but not the order in which they occur. By contrast indicating their positions in a series. A real number is a number that can be given by a finite or infinite decimal representation. The term ""real number"" was coined to distinguish it from an ""imaginary number.""

Maybe the number 9 is bad luck in the tech world.  Microsoft jumped from Windows 8 to Windows 10 and now Apple is skipping the nine in the their iPhone line.  I suppose Apple could still introduce an new older model (does that make sense?) called the iPhone 9 next year but let's not worry about that for now. The only thing I'm worried about right now is that "" "" at the top of the iPhone X screen. It looks OK on the home screen when the corners are used for the time and status information.  But in other cases such as viewing photos and videos it literally covers up part of the image. but that is not a ""full-screen display.""  When Apple demoed a game on the iPhone X the notch was actually covering up part of the touchscreen controls.  [Facepalm] I don't understand why Apple didn't just leave all the status information in a single separate bar and everything else housed in the notch.  I saw this design idea on the web which is close to what I imagined. The screen is also significantly curved at the corners.  This could be problematic for several apps that display information near the corner of the screen.  It seems Apple was so determined to make a full-screen display they made some significant compromises. Maybe I'm making this too big of a deal but right now that notch is preventing me from ordering iPhone X.  Even with all the new fancy features included with the X I might end up buying the iPhone 8 instead. Please enable JavaScript to view the ",[],No,, 
1620765199.180465,64864058,https://catto.ushistory.org/catto-and-american-civil-rights/civil-rights-timeline-with-catto/,Philadelphia and America’s Civil Rights Legacy Catto and His Times and Leadership Amy Cohen’s Catto the Forgotten Hero Catto left South Carolina at the age of seven and arrived in the Philadelphia region home to the largest free black community in the North in 1848. This community in Catto’s new home had an early legacy of strong institution building and long-standing traditions of advocacy for civil rights dating from the early founding of the nation. These early African American activists and community builders were the first generation of free blacks on whose shoulders Catto would rise. The schooling Catto received and the intellectual and political thought of this community enabled Octavius to become “the most magnetic and promising leader that the Philadelphia black community had yet produced.” (Russell F. Weigley The greater Philadelphia region had deep anti-slavery traditions and laws despite its close economic connections to the Southern cotton economy. However there were many hostile elements in Catto’s new world including racial and ethnic conflicts. William Wells Brown “Colorphobia is more rampant here than in the pro-slavery negro-bating city of New York.” with such strong southern sentiments and alliances that Abraham Lincoln was concerned that it would lean to the Confederate side during the Civil War. This environment made a mark on Catto and is part of America’s Civil Rights story. The timeline presents these influences and forces. Catto’s death also served as a catalyst in the continuing struggle for social justice well into the 20th Century and many activities and individuals of that period have connections to him and his legacy. Catto’s legacy is an important marker in the black community and among civil rights advocates. He represented the second generation of aspiring young African Americans among a small middle class and elites after the American Revolution. Their lives were in stark contrast to the majority of blacks who lived in poverty or had fragile existences. Catto marks the wave of activists that marched on in the late 19th century and the subsequent group that matured into the early 20th century. This timeline also shows this development. The efforts of all of them evidence the long struggle for equality and justice that has been the American Civil Rights story. You can see key events by scrolling through each timeline below. The earliest evidence of slavery in Pennsylvania. William Penn and the colonists tolerated slavery. However high tariffs in the 18th Century eventually discouraged the importation of more enslaved people and encouraged to use of indentured servants. Quakers and Mennonites in Germantown (Pennsylvania) petitioned against slavery. This is the first protest against African slavery made by a religious body in the English colonies. slavery becomes a central part of the South Carolina economy with enslaved Africans representing the majority of the population. Native Americans as well as Africans were enslaved initially. However after the Yamasee War (1715) slavery was virtually exclusive of Africans. The exceptions were the “lifetime indentured servants” who came as prisoners from Britain for their role in the failed Scottish Jacobite Rebellion (1774-46). South Carolina was also a favorable climate for the settlement of Sephardic Jewish immigrants many of whom became slaveholders. By 1800 Charleston had the largest Jewish population in the United States. South Carolina was racially stratified into three racial categories: white mulatto and black. It was a multi-cultural society with a slavery dependent social order. Pennsylvania Abolition Society established by Anthony Benezet an advocate and educator for blacks both male and females. Absalom Jones (St. Thomas Church) and Richard Allen (Mother Bethel) were among his students. In 1790 the Society submitted a petition to the first U.S. Congress many free blacks and some enslaved Africans served and supported the American side in the War. Among the most well-known was James Forten became a wealthy sailmaker in Philadelphia and became a prominent leading force in the black community’s fight for equality. He along with other prominent Philadelphia blacks provided financial support to William Lloyd Garrison to publish The Liberator. Forten lived until 1842 but his legacy continued to loom large in Philadelphia’s black community when Catto arrived with his family. Pennsylvania enacts the Gradual Abolition Act the first of such laws in English speaking America. Richard Allen and Absalom Jones join with others to form the Free African Society in Philadelphia. The society was a mutual aid and religious organization for “free Africans and their descendants” where members could socialize and forge business relationships. The organization served as a catalyst for other such black organizations to form in the city and other places. Founding of the American Convention for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery a joining of several state and regional antislavery societies into a national organization to promote abolition. Conference held in Philadelphia. The first independent black churches in America (St. Thomas African Episcopal Church and Bethel Church) established in Philadelphia by Absalom Jones and Richard Allen as an act of self-determination and a protest against segregation. Congress enacts the federal Slave Trade Act of 1794 prohibiting any American vessels from outfitting for the purpose of transporting enslaved people to any foreign country.  The U.S. Navy monitors the waterways for illegal activity. South Carolina. With his brother he became among the richest black men in Charleston and are both patriarchs of O. V. Catto’s DeReef family line. Because of their “dark” complexions the brothers were not accepted in the elite levels of Charleston’s mulatto society. The pair helped to form the Brown Fellowship Society. Richard DeReef owned up to 20 enslaved people which made him one of the largest slaveholders of color in the U.S. He and his cousin went to court in 1823 and persuaded a magistrate to exempt them from the state free Negro tax because they were Native American descendants. Absalom Jones and 70 other prominent free black Philadelphians petition Congress to end the slave trade. an enslaved African in Virginia attempts to organize a mass insurrection and rebellion. In response southern whites put in place more restrictions on both free blacks and enslave Africans in Virginia and other Southern states. the first federal judge in Philadelphia and founding father turns custody of 134 Africans recused by the naval vessel USS Ganges from slave ships over to the Pennsylvania Abolition Society. This enables the captives to become free people in Pennsylvania. The Independence of Haiti. French and African Haitian refugees flee to Philadelphia increasing the international character and population of the city. along with Bishop Richard Allen and James Gloucester held a meeting on colonization of blacks to Liberia at Mother Bethel Church . The meeting draws 3 who resoundingly disapproved of the idea. This meeting forced a dramatic turning point for these leaders. They no longer put support to colonization efforts. It was clear by this time that most free blacks and enslaved had been born in the United States and claimed it as their own. Robert Purvis’ family moves from Charleston to Philadelphia planned as an interim stop. William Purvis wanted to relocate his family to his native Scotland leaving a fortune to his sons. Robert Purvis became an important abolition and civil rights leader in Philadelphia. His father was a wealthy white businessman was mixed race. In Charleston the Purvis couple was only able to have a “common law” marriage due to restrictive laws. Robert Purvis although frequently mistaken to be “white” defined his identity as a black man and a kindred spirit with his grandmother whom he said was a full-blooded Moor. His wife was James Forten’s daughter. Together they formed the Vigilant Committee in the 1840’s to aid fugitive slaves. Harriet was also a founding member with her daughters and Lucretia Mott of the integrated Philadelphia Female Abolition Society. is born. He was educated at Cambridge University. Crummell’s pan-nationalist philosophy later inspires W.E.B. DuBois and Marcus Garvey. Before founding his own church in Washington Crummell served as an interim minister at St. Thomas African Episcopal Church when O.V. Catto was a member an vestryman. DuBois called Crummell the “greatest black intellectual of the 19th Century” and dedicated a chapter to him in Souls of Black Folks. With Benjamin Taller Crummell founded the American Negro Academy in memory of Frederick Douglass.  His church St. Luke’s Protestant Episcopal Church is designated as a National Historic Site. An outspoken African American abolitionist and writer David Walker published his appeal in Boston. The Appeal outraged many throughout the country but especially in the South. It was a blunt expose’ of the abuses and inequities of slavery and need for individuals to act responsibily for racial equality. Many historians and liberation theologians cite Walker’s Appeal as an influential potlitcal and social document of the 19th century. Its impact was felt throughout both Southern and Northern states as its dissemination was enabled by African American seamen in their voyages to port cities. The Denmark Vesey “Rebellion” in Charleston no independent black churches operated in Charleston again until after the Civil War. Restrictions were placed on free blacks including not permitting their return into the city if they left. The restriction compounded the impact of the legislature’s passage of the Negro Seaman’s Act of 1822 requiring free black sailors on ships that docked in Charleston to be imprisoned in the city jail for the period that their ships were in port. These actions sought to limit influences on the state’s enslaved population. Negro Convention Movement begins in Philadelphia. The convention movement among northern free black men symbolized the growth of a broad black activist network by the mid-nineteenth century. Conventions met dozens of times and were held through 1864. Convention delegates consistently linked the status of free blacks and the enslaved in their calls for meetings. In 1855 organizers of the Philadelphia convention wrote that “the elevation of the free man is inseparable (sic) from and lies at the very threshold of the great work of the slave’s restoration to freedom.” Oberlin College in Ohio becomes the first white collegiate school to admit blacks. Benjamin Tanner is born. He becomes a long-time friend of OV Catto AME Bishop and distinguished intellectual. His son became the first African American painter to gain international acclaim. His daughter graduated from Women’s Medical College in Philadelphia and became the first female doctor in Alabama. He was the grandfather to civil rights activist Sadie Alexander. During his lifetime Tanner advocated strongly for the building of monuments and tributes to recognize black accomplishments to America. He was unsuccessful in his efforts to have a memorial erected for Catto.  However Tanner was successful in his efforts in getting black Americans to commission a marble commemorative bust of Richard Allen which was on public view at the Centennial Exposition in 1876. The Institute for Colored Youth (ICY) was founded by Quaker Richard Humphreys as a school providing agricultural and industrial training. By 1851 the focused changed to training African Americans to become teachers. Charles Lewis Reason became the first principal of the school where he increased student enrollment expanded the library holdings and exposed the students to outstanding African American intellectuals and leaders of that time. Ebenezer Bassett became the second principal following the education philosophy of Reason and further exposed the students to leading blacks and intellectuals of the day. Both men would leave a mark on OV Catto along with an emerging group of young black men and women who became teachers in black schools across the country. In 1914 ICY (then renamed Cheyney) began offering a collegiate level degree when it adopted a formal normal school (teacher training) curriculum. The burning of Pennsylvania Hall occurred on the third day of the Anti-Slavery Convention of American Women. The Hall built by the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society was emblazoned with the motto “Virtue Liberty and Independence.”  Among the Society founders were James and Lucretia Mott and Robert Purvis. William Still working as a clerk for the Society in the 1850’s managed Underground Railroad operations out of the organization’s office. The Anti-Slavery Convention was an interracial gathering which further enraged agitators who opposed anti-slavery and female activism. Douglass successfully flees slavery on the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Baltimore railroad line. The expansion of voting rights to poor white men led to the loss of voting rights for black men. Octavius Catto born to William T. Catto an aspiring minister and free born millwright from the prominent mixed-race DeReef/Cain family South Carolina. He was their third child. Sarah dies in 1845 a year after the birth of their fourth child. The U.S. Supreme Court rules in the case of the slave ship Amistad that the Africans who wrested control of ship had been bound into slavery illegally and violated the 1808 ban on the slave trade. John Quincy Adams was the attorney for the Africans. The case became a symbol for abolishing slavery in America. Prominent blacks including James Forten and Robert Purvis provided financial support for the Africans’ defense. Purvis was instrumental in commissioning a portrait by Nathaniel Jocelyn of Joseph Cinque which was broadly reproduced to raise money for the defense.  The original portrait hung in Purvis’ home. Because of the release of the Africans Martin Van Buren lost his re-election campaign and tensions over slavery increased between the North and the South. On the morning of August 1 a parade on Lombard Street of over 1 000 members of the black Young Men’s Vigilant Association commemorating the eighth anniversary of the end of slavery in the British West Indies was attacked by an Irish Catholic mob. Over three days of attacks numerous homes and public buildings in the black community were looted a year after the birth of her fourth child. William Catto marries Mary Anderson a free Charleston mulatto also of the DeReef kinship line and decides to find a way to pursue the Presbyterian ministry full-time. This decision changes not only the direction of William’s life but would also sends his family on a journey outside of South Carolina. The first recorded baseball game in America. Originally known as “base ball” (two words) this sport would grow in popularity starting with amateur urban clubs. As young men Catto and his associates first played cricket but then in 1865 formed the Pythian amateur base ball club supported by the African American Knights of Pythias fraternal organization located at 19th and Addison Street in Philadelphia. Irish potato famine begins with widespread failures of the potato crop and Irish immigration to America increases producing increased competition with blacks for employment. The Irish form the largest ethnic group to come into Philadelphia. In the 1840s and 1850s anti-Catholic sentiment grew against the Irish and eventually led to nativist riots and the Lombard Street riot where Irish targeted blacks. Blacks and Irish lived in adjacent communities. Maryland with the intent of William going to Liberia as a Presbyterian missionary and teacher in the coastal town of Nanna Kroo. When the South Carolina Presbytery uncovered writings where William wrote to a friend: “Keep the flame burning…” his license is revoked and orders issued to arrest him and return him South. William packed his family and fled to Pennsylvania. O.V. Catto and his family arrived in Philadelphia after a short stay in New Jersey. In Philadelphia OV Catto attends the segregated Vaux Primary School and then enrolled in the Lombard Street Grammar School. His father becomes pastor of the First African Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia which was founded by James Gloucester. calling for equal rights for women and men is signed by 100 men and women in Wesleyan Methodist Chapel New York at the first Women’s Rights Convention led by Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. During this time Mott was also actively involved in the work of the Female Anti-Slavery Society and the Vigilant Committee with Harriett Purvis. Debate on the future of slavery in the territories escalates when Henry Clay introduces the Compromise of 1850 to the U.S. Congress. It culminates with the passage of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law limiting legal rights of escaped slaves and imposing penalties on anyone aiding a fugitive. Any person aiding a runaway slave by providing food or shelter was subject to six months’ imprisonment and a $1 000 fine. Abolitionists called this new federal law the “Bloodhound Law” refering the to use of dogs to track down fugitives. The compromise briefly defused some tensions between slave and free states and abolished the slave trade in Washington William Still and others form the Vigilance Committee in Philadelphia to aid escaping blacks and protect free blacks from slave catchers. This becomes part of an expansive network of “Underground Railroad” activity. Philadelphia became an important hub because it is the most southern major northern city. Harvard accepts its first black students. Richard Greener becomes the first black of graduate from Harvard. He came to the Institute for Colored Youth as a teacher and assistant to O.V. Catto. Later in 1871 upon Catto’s assassination he became head of its male division. Greener later became dean of Howard Law School. Women’s Medical College of Pennsylvania opens in Philadelphia. It is the second medical institution in the world established to train women in medicine and offer them the M.D. degree. The school had strong abolition connections. In 1867 Rebecca Cole became the first black women to graduate from the school and receives a medical degree. She was the second in the nation to do so. Cole was an ICY graduate. The school’s first African American student was Sarah Mapps Douglass in 1852. Douglass did not graduate but went on to teach at ICY. is born. Pliny attends ICY and is Catto’s teammate and close friend on the Pythians baseball team. Alain Locke known as the “Father of the Harlem Renaissance” is ranked among the greatest black intellectuals of the 20th Century. Federal marshals and Maryland slave hunters seek out suspected fugitive slaves in Christiana (Lancaster County) near Philadelphia. In their ensuing struggles with black and white abolitionists one of the attackers is killed and another is seriously wounded. Thirty-six black men and five whites are charged with treason and conspiracy under the 1850 Fugitive Slave Law. Their trial held at Independence Hall in Philadelphia became a cause celebre among blacks and abolitionists. Thaddeus Stevens defended the accused. All defendants were found innocent by the jury. helping to inspire the anti-slavery movement in the 1850’s. With the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854 Congress authorized the citizens of the respective states to decide whether they would be free or slave holding. This essentially repealed the Compromise of 1850 and set off bloody battles in Kansas over slavery. Abolitionist John Brown and his sons participated in the “Bleeding Kansas” battles. Catto enrolls in the Institute for Colored Youth (ICY) which offered classical subjects including Latin trigonometry and oratory. Under the leadership of its principals Charles Reason and Ebenezer Bassett the school grows the intellectual and social curiosity of its students by bringing in leading black intellectuals and other leaders to engage them. The school was a magnet for students from black middle class and elites families. It was these families who could afford the tuition or permit their children the time to attend school. Less fortunate families needed their children to work to help support their families. The Republican Party is formed by anti-slavery expansion activists. Lincoln University (originally Ashmun Institute) is established and is the first degree granting black collegiate school in the U.S. During its first 100 years Lincoln graduates approximately 20% of the black physicians and 10% of black attorneys in the United States. Thurgood Marshall and Langston Hughes are among its esteemed alumni. An early graduate is William Wilberforce Still the son of abolitionist William Still William Still and others form the Banneker Institute for “improving mental faculties”. The Institute named to honor Benjamin Banneker was an elite literary association. It became an important forum for discussion and political activism among men in Philadelphia’s black community. OV Catto like many of his friends joined their father as a member when they graduated from ICY. Negro Convention of black men held in Philadelphia. William Still and white abolitionist Passmore Williamson rescue Jane Johnson and her children and help her take the Camden ferry out of Philadelphia to freedom. Williamson is incarcerated for several months for not bringing Johnson to court. The case becomes a national news story that continued from August to November. It was a national tipping point over slavery. Wilberforce University is founded in Ohio and is the first college owned and operated by African Americans. It is named to honor the British Abolitionist William Wilberforce. Wilberforce was well-known among African Americans and much admired. William Still gave his oldest son “Wilberforce” as his middle name. William Wilberforce was also a member of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society. The Republican Party holds its first convention in Philadelphia at Musical Fund Hall located at 808 Locust Street. The convention approved an anti-slavery platform. Abraham Lincoln was on the ballot for Vice President but William L. Dayton received the nomination. The landmark United States Supreme Court ruling in the Dred Scott v. Sanford case declares that blacks have no citizenship rights. This was a major blow to Northern free blacks especially in areas where they had been granted citizenship rights including the right to vote. In most states voting was based on paying taxes. Consequently the rights of middle class and elite blacks were being infringed. After completing the rigorous course of study at ICY O.V. Catto is hired as a teacher of English and mathematics at the school. He is also elected secretary of the Benjamin Banneker Institute. John Brown conducts a raid on the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry to free and arm enslaved people. His effort fails and he is executed. Philadelphia blacks hold a vigil at Shiloh Baptist Church during his hanging business and some churches were draped in black. Southern medical students countered the actions of the black community by strutting through the city speaking about how many “niggers” they owned. Brown’s body traveled through Philadelphia under cover on its way back to New York due to concerns about violence by pro-slavery factions in the city. Many of Catto’s personal connections had close ties with John Brown among them Thomas Dorsey and Ebenezer Bassett who was identified in a letter John Brown carried in a letter in his vest pocket at his hanging. O.V. Catto is among the Banneker Society young men who began holding more of their discussions of issues of the day in “the public square” including outside of Independence Hall instead of in meeting halls. In Catto’s world John Brown died in service of his country. Their speech reflected this belief. Abraham Lincoln is elected president and Southern states secede from the Union. The Civil War begins when Confederates fire on Fort Sumter. Fannie Jackson (Coppin) enters Oberlin College. This step positions her for her career at the Institute for Colored Youth. when Confederate forces attack Fort Sumter in South Carolina. The U.S. Secretary of the Navy authorizes the enlistment of contrabands (enslaved people) taken in Confederate territories. More than a half million enslaved and freedmen sought protection behind Union lines. Catto moves to the 800 block of Lombard Street in a boarding house establishing an independent life from his family. He remains at the boarding house until his death in 1871. The U.S. Sanitary Commission (USSC) is formed to raise money and materiel to improve conditions for soldiers on the battlefield and to support hospitals caring for the wounded. Philadelphia established a branch of the USSC which acted as a regional center and depot for distributing resources. In Pennsylvania women formed their own subsidiary which served as a conduit for receiving donations from hundreds of smaller local aid societies. The largest and most successful of the Sanitary Commission fundraising activities was the Great Central Fair held at Logan Square from June 7 to June 28 accompanied by wife Mary and son Todd visited the Great Central Fair on June 16 1864. African Americans generally were excluded from participating in USSC activities. Black congregations and women’s groups channeled support to the U.S. Colored Troops and other Union soldiers. Among the young black women spearheading this effort was Caroline LeCount who became OV Catto’s fiance. LeCount is best known for her efforts to desegregate streetcars in Philadelphia which were especially needed by black women working to get supplies to USCT soldiers at Camp William Penn in Cheltenhelm (outside Philadelphia) in 1863. The first black Union Army forces are organized in South Carolina. daughter of Robert Forten and Robert Purvis’ niece South Carolina as a teacher for the Philadelphia Port Royal Commission. The Atlantic Monthly publishes her essays on her experiences Life on the Sea Islands in 1864. Charlotte is the granddaughter of sailmaker who amassed one of the largest fortunes in Philadelphia of his times. President Lincoln issues Emancipation Proclamation which frees nearly 4 million enslaved people in Confederate territories. The proclamation also issued orders to enlist black volunteers for three years enabling the creation of the United States Colored Troops (USCT). in response to an emergency of encroaching Confederates in Pennsylvania Jr. form a military unit of ninety volunteers PA. Major General Darius Couch sent them back to Philadelphia stating they were not “enlisting” for three years. The United States War Department issues General Order Number 143 on May 22 establishing a “Bureau of Colored Troops” to facilitate the recruitment of African-American soldiers to fight for the Union Army. The 54th Massachusetts is organized. Free blacks throughout the North enlist in the 54th. The largest group are Pennsylvanians. Other training stations outside of Philadelphia are later established. Between 178 00 black men enlisted and white officers served under the Bureau of Colored Troops. The USCT recruitment offices open at 1210 Chestnut Street. The site is originally the headquarters and recruiting station of The Supervisory Committee for the Enlistment of Colored Troops and later for The Free Military School for Applicants for the Command of Colored Troops seeking white officers. The temporary Union League clubhouse is three doors at 1216 Chestnut Street. The Union League worked in concert with black leaders such as Frederick Douglass and William Still to recruit black soldiers. Catto presents the USCT 24th Regiment with its regimental flag designed by artist David Bustill Bowser at a ceremony at the PA State House (Independence Hall). The motto inscribed on the flag “Let Soldiers in War Be Citizens in Peaceʺ reflects African American aspirations for citizenship rights and equality. formed by John Mercer Langston and including Frederick Douglass Henry Highland Garnett and O.V. Catto New York. The League worked through state level chapters. Catto became secretary of the Pennsylvania chapter in 1864. The Pennsylvania chapter was the largest within the League. Catto joins St. Thomas African Episcopal Church and later serves as a vestryman. St. Thomas parishioners were among some of the most strident abolitionists and civil rights activists within the Philadelphia black community. The church membership also included many faculty members at the Institute for Colored Youth as well as members of the Pythian base ball club. One of the best known speeches in American History Lincoln delivered it on November 19 1863. Lincoln’s speech lasted only about 2 minutes. In it he reiterated the ideals for human equality in the Declaration of Independence and reinforced that the Civil War was being fought to keep the Union together with “a new birth of freedom” for all citizens. Many historians see this speech marking what was to be known as “America’s Second Founding.” With Caroline LeCount and other Philadelphia black women and men Catto work more aggressively to desegregate Philadelphia’s trolley car system resulting in a state law to end segregated trolleys. Catto sat in a trolley car all night and eventually attracted a crowd and brought African Americans one-step closer to achieving desegregated transportation. A meeting was held in Samson Street Hall to protest the treatment of African American women and children and to demand more respect and justice for the African Americans. A speech given by Catto explained the ways in which African Americans have given to America and expressed that they should be given equal rights to transportation but also equal rights in general. William Still and Catto moved the desgregation debate to Harrisburg to the state legislature. This effort was supported by Pennsylvania politicians Thaddeus Stephens and William Kelly as well as the Union League. Pennsylvania opened the streetcars to all in March 1867. Fannie Jackson graduates Oberlin with a collegiate degree in teaching and accepts a teaching position at the Institute for Colored Youth Latin and Mathematics in the female division. Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrenders to General Ulysses S. Grant the Thirteenth Amendment passes the U.S. Senate ending slavery. It is ratified by the states on December 6th. Abraham Lincoln is assassinated on April 14th. His body laid in state at Independence Hall paid homage to him. Catto was among the leaders who paraded at Independence Hall to mourn Lincoln. Lincoln’s funeral in Philadelphia is the largest public funeral held in the city. Catto pioneers the racial shift in baseball by forming the Pythian Baseball club an amateur team made up of black business and middle-class professional men from the Washington and New York regions. The effort was supported by the Knights of Pythias fraternal organization and its Philadelphia founding member William Still. (The fraternal order was the first to be authorized by Congress and the charter was granted by Abraham Lincoln.) The team dissolved at Catto’s death in 1871. A new Pythians team with professional players was organized in 1887 as part of the National Colored Baseball League. The Freedmen’s Bureau is established by the War Department with the purpose of supervising relief and educational activities relating to the refugees and freedmen. Many ICY students joined the cadre of people working in the North and the South to support the freedmen. Many are teachers. Others also work on the political front. The Freedmen’s Bank is chartered by the federal government as a private corporation. By 1866 the bank had established 19 branches in 12 states. The Philadelphia office became one of the most successful operations. It attracted a large number of societies other private organizations and individuals who opened accounts and established trusts with the company. O.V. Catto is listed as the 6th person to open an account at the Philadelphia office. The bank served as both an important symbol of black self-determination and a means for the black community to build economic wealth through savings particularly in the South following the economic devastation of the Civil War and the poor economic condition of the formerly enslaved. Catto joins the Pennsylvania National Guard’s 5th Brigade at the invitation of the Brigade Commander General Louis Wagner. Catto was promoted to Brigade Inspector General with the rank of Major making him the highest ranking African-American in the military services at that time. His role was to inspect the troops while riding on horseback. It is said that Catto was a very capable horseman. Congress passes the Civil Rights Act of 1866 the first federal law protecting the rights of African Americans. It is vetoed by President Andrew Johnson.  Johnson’s veto is overridden by Congress. The law solidified an alliance based on “principles” among moderate and radical Republicans which in the coming years would lead to Constitutional changes defining citizenship and the rights of citizens for blacks. Republicans gain veto proof majorities in the Senate and House to override President Johnson’s vetoes. Morton McMichael is elected the first Republican mayor of Philadelphia and supports efforts to enlarge civil rights and liberties for blacks. McMichael was a founding member of the Union League and its fourth president. Mississippi becomes the first of the former Confederate states to enact Black Codes severely limiting the rights and liberties of blacks. It is the first immediate resistance reaction by southern whites. Other southern states soon follow. The Ku Klux Klan is formed by ex-Confederates in Pulaski Fisk University (Tennessee) is established for former enslaved people by the American Missionary Association and becomes the first black American college to receive a class “A” rating from the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools in 1878. DuBois graduated from Fisk in 1888. the first African American mummers club in Philadelphia is formed and had 300 members in the 1906 Mummers’ Parade. Mummery was a pasttime that interested blacks and several clubs were formed. However over time the level of participation greatly diminished due to discriminatory practices in judging. The Octavius Catto Club named for Catto after his death was the last club to participate. It withdrew after the 1929 parade when the judges ranked its performance last. where blacks are granted the franchise the Republican Party wins victories. Congress charters Howard University. It opened as a nonsectarian school admitting both sexes and all races. It became a premier institution and played an important role in America’s civil rights history. It is here that Thurgood Marshall as a student of Charles Hamiton Houston earned his law degree in 1933 graduating first in his class. granting citizenship to any person born or naturalized in the United States. This established the precedent of “birth right citizenship”. W.E.B. DuBois is born. After completion of his doctorate at Harvard in 1896 he came to Philadelphia and did the landmark study where he paid homage to O.V. Catto. He also exposed the deep poverty within the black community. DuBois’ Pan African philosophy was inspired by Alexander Crummell whom DuBois paid tribute to in Chapter 12 of Souls of Black Folks. Among DuBois’ significant work was serving as editor of The Crisis magazine by the NAACP. Hampton Institute is founded by black and white leaders of the American Missionary Association to provide education to freedmen. In 1878 training for Native Americans was added and continued until 1923. The National Convention of Colored Men meets in Washington promoting that the franchise and other privileges of citizenship be extended to black men in northern areas. Catto works on Pennsylvania’s ratification of the 15th Amendment which prohibits discrimination against male citizens in registration and voting based on race Louisiana sends the first black legislators to Congress. Ebenezer Bassett steps down as ICY principal receiving an appointment from President Grant to be minister of Haiti.

Fannie Jackson replaces Bassett as ICY principal and begins a 37-year distinguished career. She is the first black women to be named a school principal in the U.S. In granting her the principal appointment ICY Board of Managers noted her holding a college degree which Catto did not have. Catto becomes head of the ICY boy’s division and Richard Greener the first African American to graduate Harvard with a college degree is named assistant principal of the boy’s division when Catto goes on leave to work in DC on curriculum for newly formed black schools. Greener became head of the boy’s division after Catto’s assassination. He later was appointed dean of Howard Law School. Catto takes a one month leave of absence from ICY to work on curriculum for black schools in Washington D.C. He was received with great enthusiasm. Many working in the schools are former ICY students.

There was no federal presence at this election. Prior to being shot Catto was seeking to activate his Pennsylvania Reserve unit to provide protection to black voters. Catto’s funeral is the largest public funeral in Philadelphia since Lincoln’s and his death is mourned in many black communities throughout the country. He was seen as the “most magnetic and promising leader that the Philadelphia black community had yet produced.” He was laid to rest at Lebanon Graveyard a black cemetery run by the family of childhood friend and Pythian teammate Jr. When Lebanon was condemned and closed in the early 20th Century Catto was remains were moved to Eden Cemetery a historic African American cemetery now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2008 Catto’s headstone was vandalized along with 200 others. A new headstone was put in place in 2010. Catto was well known in many places in the United States in large part because of his extensive network of civil rights activists. Stories of Catto’s assassination appeared in papers throughout the United States including in the New York Times. Rev Henry Highland Garnett eulogized Catto at Shiloh Presbyterian Church in NYC. John Mercer Langston convened the law faculty at Howard University and said: “Yet we cannot but express the hope that out of the life-blood of O.V. Catto (another of our martyrs) a holier and better civilization may spring that hate no man on account of his creed and color.” Catto was honored with the naming of the Catto Secondary School in Philadelphia in 1895. Caroline LeCount the first black person in the city to hold such a position. Later the Catto Disciplinary School opened when the Secondary School closed. This school was renamed to honor Paul Robeson. Today the OV Catto Community School (K-8) in Camden New Jersey stands as a memorial to Catto.

In October 1871 a ‘Catto Medal’ was authorized for deserving soldiers of the Pennsylvania National Guard by order of General Louis Wagner commander of the 5th Brigade PANG as an honor and commemoration for Major Octavius V. Catto 5th Brigade. The medal was not awarded again until 2012. The original medal cast was lost over the years and a new Catto medal cast was created when the award was reinstated. Benjamin Tanner and others sought to have a memorial created to honor Catto’s honor but with no success. In 1903 the Elk Lodge had its name change to be the O.V. Catto Lodge. The Lodge’s original banner is in the collections of the Philadelphia History Museum. St. Thomas African Episcopal Church continually recognizes Catto as its honored churchmen and maintains archives and artifacts related to Catto. Among these is a ceremonial bat of the Pythians. In 2004 served as a catalyst for forming the O.V. Catto Memorial Fund to have a public monument honoring Catto placed on the apron of City Hall. One hundred and forty-six years after Catto’s death in September 2017 the City of Philadelphia with support from the Catto Memorial Fund dedicated a public monument to him on the apron of City Hall.

By 1920 the population grew from 22 further straining racial tensions in the city as blacks moved beyond the 7th Ward. Pennsylvania ends segregation in its schools although most schools remain segregated. School attendance was based on neighborhoods.

Phillip Randolph is born. He led the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters in a successful national effort that gained improved employment conditions and higher wages for the car porters. The porter labor movement was the backbone for building the black middle class and became a force in producing the modern Civil Rights Movement with its early “March on Washington” campaigns. This latter work was accomplished with the aid of local Brotherhood Women’s Auxiliaries in major cities and in alliance with Baynard Rustin from West Chester Pennsylvania (outside of Philadelphia) and a graduate of Cheyney University. In 1956 Baynard became an important ally and supporter to Dr. Martin Luther and brought the tactics he learned working for the Brotherhood to King’s efforts. Baynard is the unrecognized genius behind the 1963 March on Washington who were the  troops on the ground Ida B. Wells begins her anti-lynching campaign.

Lynchings of both black men and women in the United States rose in number after the Civil War following the emancipation. It is estimated that over 3 445 blacks were lynched between 1882 and 1965 with most occurring before 1937. Lynchings also began appearing in the North during the Great Migration of blacks into Northern areas.  Among these was the lynching of Zachariah Walker in 1911 in Coatesville just outside of Philadelphia. Walker’s lynching was a “spectacle lynching” 000 people. The political message was the promotion of white supremacy and black powerlessness. An important element of the ritual included photographing and publishing lynchings that were sold as popular souvenirs throughout the U.S. Nativist and anti-black organizations in the form of the American Protective Association and the Ku Klux Klan spread.

DuBois begins his seminal study of Philadelphia’s black community in the 7th Ward The Philadelphia Negro.  He exposed how the city’s Republican machine doled out offices and bribes to blacks but did little to improve conditions in the Ward.  His study detailed the deplorable conditions blacks faced in the city.  DuBois also interviewed individuals who knew Catto.  These individuals spoke to Catto’s lasting meaning to the black community some twenty-five years after his assassination.  DuBois included the Catto story in The Philadelphia Negro. 000 African American served in the War.

The Lodge continues today. led by W.E.B DuBois and Monroe Trotter begins with its first meeting at Niagara Falls.

Against local opposition 15 white males were charged and tried; however none were convicted. A large crowd outside of the court room cheered as an all white jury delivered the verdict.

In partnership with Booker T. Washington a part owner in Sears and Roebuck begins creating model rural schools for blacks and also stimulated the construction of new public schools in the South. Believing that the lack of education opportunity was the major crisis for blacks in the U.S. together they created more than 5 000 community schools into the 1930’s. Many of these schools became places where ICY  (Cheyney) graduates taught. Down the road many of these schools were embroiled in civil rights efforts to equalize education between blacks and white. Jim Crow laws and practices are further expanded throughout the United States with the election of Woodrow Wilson. This included policies that expanded segregation in the federal government. Numerous black federal civil servants were removed from their jobs across the country. Woodrow Wilson threw civil rights leader William Monroe Trotter out of the White House. Trotter had led a delegation of blacks to meet with the president to discuss the surge of segregation in the country. Wilson was unsympathic. During his tenure as President Wilson expanded segregation in federal office which included the removal of well-educated blacks from federal jobs they long held for years.  Among them was Daniel Alexander Payne Murray who had joined the Library’s professional staff in 1871.

The highest fatality occured in rural Elaine Arkansas where 240 blacks were killed. Philadelphian William Coleman is born.  He becomes a leading civil rights activist serving as an advisor to Thurgood Marshall in preparing arguments and strategy for the Brown v. Board case.  After graduating from Harvard Law he was the first African American to clerk at the Supreme Court.

During its time it was known as the “New Negro Movement” named after the 1925 anthology by Alaine Locke Pliny Locke. The Movement also included new African-American cultural expressions across the urban areas in the Northeast and Midwest United States affected by the Great Migration of which Harlem was the largest. The cities of Philadelphia and New York City saw some of the biggest population increases in the early part of the twentieth century. Woodson’s effort represented the much needed work identified by Benjamin Tanner (Catto’s close friend and ally) more than 50 years earlier to show the important contributions that black people made to world civilizations. Woodson also contended that the teaching of this history “was essential to the physical and intellectual survival of the black race in society”. The Journal of Negro History was Carter’s main vehicle for disseminating African American heritage. By 1976 Black History Month was being celebrated all across the country in educational institutions centers of Black culture and community centers when President Gerald Ford recognized Black History Month during the U.S. Bicentennial. Ford urged all Americans to “seize the opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history.” King becomes the best known American civil rights icon of the 20th Century advacing civil rights through non-violence and disobedience.

These images suggest a language because they seem to tell a story (say of a hunting expedition in which specific events occurred) rather than being simply pictures of animals and people. does not emerge until its invention in c. 3500 -3000 BCE. This early writing was called and consisted of making specific marks in wet clay with a reed implement. The writing system of the Egyptians was already in use before the rise of the Period (c. 3150 BCE) and is thought to have developed from Mesopotamian cuneiform (though this theory is disputed) and came to be known as heiroglyphics. The phoenetic writing systems of the Greeks (""phoenetic"" from the though quite different from that of Mesopotamia still owes its development to the and their advances in the written word. Independently of the writing was developed in Mesoamerica by the c. 250 CE with some evidence suggesting a date as early as 500 BCE and c. 1200 BCE and appears to also have arisen independently as there is no evidence of cultural transference at this time between China and Mesopotamia. The ancient Chinese practice of divination involved etching marks on bones or shells which were then heated until they cracked. The cracks would then be interpreted by a Diviner. If that Diviner had etched `Next Tuesday it will rain' and `Next Tuesday it will not rain' the pattern of the cracks on the bone or shell would tell him which would be the case. In time these etchings evolved into the Chinese History is impossible without the written word as one would lack context in which to interpret physical evidence from the ancient past. Writing records the lives of a people and so is the first necessary step in the written history of a culture or . A prime example of this problem is the difficulty scholars of the late 19th/early 20th centuries CE had in understanding the in that they could not read the glyphs of the Maya and so wrongly interpreted much of the physical evidence they excavated. The early explorers of the Maya sites such as Stephens and Catherwood believed they had found evidence of an ancient This same problem is evident in understanding the ancient Kingdom of whose Meroitic Script is yet to be deciphered as well as the so-called which also has yet to be understood.

The Sumerians first invented writing as a means of long-distance communication which was necessitated by The Sumerians first invented writing as a means of long-distance communication which was necessitated by trade. With the rise of the and the need for resources which were lacking in the region the need to be able to communicate across the expanses between cities or regions. The earliest form of writing was pictographs – symbols which represented objects – and served to aid in remembering such things as which parcels of grain had gone to which destination or how many sheep were needed for events like sacrifices in the temples. These pictographs were impressed onto wet clay which was then dried and these became official records of commerce. As was a very popular beverage in ancient Mesopotamia many of the earliest records extant have to do with the sale of beer. With pictographs one could tell how many jars or vats of beer were involved in a transaction but not necessarily what that transaction meant. As the historian Kriwaczek notes All that had been devised thus far was a technique for noting down things not a writing system. A record of `Two Sheep ' tells us nothing about whether the sheep are being delivered to or anything else about them. (63) In order to express concepts more complex than financial transactions or lists of items a more elaborate writing system was required and this was developed in the gave way to phonograms – symbols which represented sounds – and those sounds were the spoken language of the people of Sumer. With phonograms one could more easily convey precise meaning and so in the example of the two sheep and the temple of Inanna one could now make clear whether the sheep were going to or coming from the temple whether they were living or dead and what role they played in the life of the temple. Previously one had only static images in pictographs showing objects like sheep and temples. With the development of phonograms one had a dynamic means of conveying motion to or from a location. whereas in earlier writing (known as proto-cuneiform) one was restricted to lists of things a writer could now indicate what the significance of those things might be. The scholar Ira Spar writes: This new way of interpreting signs is called the rebus principle. Only a few examples of its use exist in the earliest stages of cuneiform from between 3200 and 3000 B.C. The consistent use of this type of phonetic writing only becomes apparent after 2600 B.C. It constitutes the beginning of a true writing system characterized by a complex combination of word-signs and phonograms—signs for vowels and syllables—that allowed the scribe to express ideas. By the middle of the Third Millennium B.C. cuneiform primarily written on clay tablets was used for a vast array of economic The Art of War by Sun-Tzu This new means of communication allowed scribes to record the events of their times as well as their religious beliefs and to create an art form which was not possible before the written word: literature. The first writer in history known by name is the Mesopotamian priestess who wrote her hymns to the goddess Inanna and signed them with her name and seal. four poems dealing with King Enmerkar of Uruk and his son Lugalbanda were probably composed between 2112-2004 BCE (though only written down between 2017-1763 BCE). In the first of them it is explained that writing developed because the messenger of King Enmerkar going back and forth between him and the King of the city of Aratta eventually had too much to remember and so Enmerkar had the idea to write his messages down; and so writing was born. considered the first epic tale in the world and among the oldest extant literature was composed at some point earlier than c. 2150 BCE when it was written down and deals with the great king of Uruk (and descendent of Enmerkar and Lugalbanda) Gilgamesh and his quest for the meaning of life. The myths of the people of Mesopotamia the stories of their gods and heroes were now all able to be recorded for posterity. Writing made history possible because now events could be recorded and later read by any literate individual instead of relying on a community's storyteller to remember and recite past events. Scholar Samuel Noah Kramer comments: [The Sumerians] originated a system of writing on clay which was borrowed and used all over the Near East for some two thousand years. Almost all that we know of the early history of western Asia comes from the thousands of clay documents inscribed in the cuneiform script developed by the Sumerians and excavated by archaeologists. (4) So important was writing to the Mesopotamians that 000 clay tablet books were collected in the library of his capital at . Ashurbanipal was hoping to preserve the heritage and history of the region and understood clearly the importance of the written word in achieving this end. Among the many books in his library Ashurbanipal included works of literature such as the tale of Gilgamesh or the story of Etana because he realized that literature articulates not just the story of a certain people but of all people. The historian Durant writes: Literature is at first words rather than letters despite its name; it arises as clerical chants or magic charms recited usually by the priests and transmitted orally from memory to memory. as the Romans named poetry meant both verses and charms; meant originally a magic spell; so did the English by the rhythms of nature and bodily life were apparently developed by magicians or shamans to preserve and enhance the magic incantations of their verse. Out of these sacerdotal origins and the historian were differentiated and secularized: the orator as the official lauder of the king or solicitor of the deity; the historian as the recorder of the royal deeds; the poet as the singer of originally sacred chants the formulator and preserver of heroic legends and the musician who put his tales to for the instruction of populace and kings. The role of the poet in preserving heroic legends would become an important one in cultures throughout the ancient world. The Mesopotamian scribe Shin-Legi-Unninni (wrote 1300-1000 BCE) would help preserve and transmit (c. 800 BCE) would do the same for the Greeks and (70-19 BCE) for the Romans. The Indian epic (written down c. 400 BCE) preserves the oral legends of that region in the same way the tales and legends of and those which came after them were only made possible through the advent of writing. The early cuneiform writers established a system which would completely change the nature of the world in which they lived. The past and the stories of the people could now be preserved through writing. The ' contribution of the alphabet made writing easier and more accessible to other cultures but the basic system of putting symbols down on paper to represent words and concepts began much earlier.  Durant notes: The Phoenicians did not create the alphabet they marketed it; taking it apparently from they imported it piecemeal to and exported it to every city on the of the alphabet. By the time of Homer the Greeks were taking over this Phoenician – or the allied Aramaic – alphabet and were calling it by the Semitic names of the first two letters evolved into the written language of those cultures so that the Greek and Latin would serve as the basis for European script in the same way that the Semitic Aramaic script would provide the basis for Hebrew . The materials of writers have evolved as well from the cut reeds with which early Mesopotamian scribes marked the clay tablets of cuneiform to the reed pens and papyrus of the Egyptians the parchment of the scrolls of the Greeks and Romans the calligraphy of the Chinese on through the ages to the present day of computerized composition and the use of processed paper. writing has served to communicate the thoughts and feelings of the individual and of that person's culture and their experiences with the human condition and to preserve those experiences for future generations.

This wasn't an iPhone 3G or 7.  It was just ""iPhone"" — the original. I replaced my old Samsung flip phone with the Apple's and switched from T-Mobile to AT&T.  I've never looked back. Less than a week after buying the iPhone I left for Europe.  The iPhone wouldn't be available in Europe for several months so you can imagine how excited people were when they saw it.  Whether I was in France the iPhone never failed to impress.  The locals were awestruck by the iPhone's sleek design and amazing touchscreen.  The first time people saw ""pinch to zoom People looked at me like I was from the future — because I was.  The iPhone not only changed the mobile phone it changed our way of life. nearly all my friends have an iPhone.  Those who don't have an which was inspired by the iPhone.  Those who could see the future back in 2007 and who had some money to invest probably made a pretty good return in Apple stock which has increased more than 700% since the iPhone's launch.  Of course most people who invested in AAPL probably wish they would have invested more or not sold their shares so early. Steve Jobs and his team at Apple set out to reinvent the phone — and they did.  The phones we carry in our pockets are mini computers.  The current iPhone 7 is several times faster than most from 2007.  We don't just take photos and play music with our iPhones and snap our friends throughout the day.  And we use millions of other apps. and other portable devices have also influenced the way we live over the past decade.  But nothing has impacted our lives like the iPhone.  Nothing has even come close. the novelty of the iPhone has faded and I now take for granted the benefits it provides.  I get frustrated when something takes too long to load or an app doesn't work the way I want it to.  So today on this 10-year anniversary of the iPhone I pause to reflect and be grateful for the most significant invention of our time. since Steve Jobs is not around to see the impact the iPhone has had the past several years.  But if he could see the millions of people with iPhones and all the ways we use them I think he would be pleased.  He did make a dent in the universe after all.

It is the total number of digits on a person's two hands or two feet. . Ten is the smallest noncototient a number that can not be expressed as the difference between any integer and the total number of coprimes below it. Ten is the second discrete biprime (2.5) and the second member of the (2.q) discrete biprime family. Ten has an aliquot sum σ(n) of 8 and is accordingly the first discrete biprime to be in deficit. All subsequent discrete biprimes are in deficit. The aliquot sequence for 10 comprises five members (10 0) with this number being the second composite member of the 7-aliquot tree Ten is the sum of the first three prime numbers and also of the first four factorials. Ten is the eighth Perrin number preceded in the sequence by 5 with ten sides is a decagon and 10 is a decagonal number. But it is also a triangular number and a centered triangular number. Ten is the number of n-Queens Problem solutions for n = 5. Ten is the base of the by far the most common system of denoting in both spoken and written language. Ten is the first two-digit number in decimal and thus the lowest number where the position of a numeral affects its value. Any integer written in the decimal system can be multiplied by ten by adding a zero to the end (e.g. 855 * 10 = 8550). The reason for the choice of ten is assumed to be that humans have ten fingers (digits). The digit '1' followed by '0' is how the value of p is written in base p. (E.g. 16 in hexadecimal is 10.) The Roman numeral for ten is X (which looks like two V's [the Roman numeral for 5] put together); it is thought that the V for five is derived from an open hand (five digits displayed).

We were to stay at a Knight’s Village Woodland Lodge a set of 28 semi-detached lodges set within the castle grounds. Originally opened in 2016 to complement the castle’s Tower Suites and Medieval Glamping Village the Woodland Lodges also – we were told – featured evening entertainment and an on-site restaurant. As we imagine is the case with most visitors we arrived at Warwick Castle by car. Luckily finding the correct car park for the Knight’s Village was a simple case of looking out for the Stratford Road Car Park signs. Once parked up the Knight’s Village reception was only around 100 metres away and the walk was easily accessible for push chairs. Check-in was a rather straightforward affair and although they recommended that we booked in advance for dinner then and there we decided to take our chances (more on dinner later). we walked along a raised walkway through woodland to our lodge passing the glamping site (pictured below) as we went. nestled towards the back of the village which – considering we had a two year old in tow – was perfectly quiet and away from the main thoroughfares. The property itself included a double bedroom and a shower room. In terms of presentation it really was quite stunning and it was clear that a lot of care and attention has gone in to the lodge’s construction. The blend of old and new worked particularly well with a modern flat screen TV and a stylish bathroom juxtaposed against an old style bed frame and shields and swords hanging from the walls. As well as the inside space there was a small outdoor sitting area in front of the property which provided a nice space to sit enjoy a coffee and the charming woodland view. One thing I would say is that although the property was perfectly formed it was a little on a small side. Not a problem for my family of three but those looking for a bit more room should definitely look at the more spacious Knight’s Lodges which can sleep up to five people. Pictured above: The front door to lodge 121 Pictured above: Child’s bedroom on the left bathroom and shower on the right we had no problem in turning up to the dining hall at around 6:30pm. However this may have been because we were staying just after the summer holidays had finished and we probably wouldn’t recommend being so blithe during peak season! Dinner itself was a fun affair being held in an old style banquet hall. The buffet was similar to what you’d expect from a Sunday carvery (fitting nicely in to the overall banqueting feast theme) and refillable low-sugar soft drinks are included in the reasonable price of £18.95 per adult and £9.95 per child. Alcohol is served from a small bar at the back of the hall but you’ll need to stump up some extra silver florins as beers wines and spirits aren’t included in the price. we were however rudely interrupted by two knights (as you do) who were rowling up the dining crowd for the evening entertainment. All jokes aside this was a lovely touch and really added to the experience; our two year old was transfixed! Pictured Above: The Knight’s Village Banqueting Hall The evening entertainment was focused almost exclusively at children so this may be one to skip if you’re planning a romantic retreat. Our two-year old was a bit too small to join in with the activities but the older children did seem to be having fun with falconry and various other kid-friendly shenanigans. The evening entertainment is held on a field directly adjacent to the Knight’s Village camping tents and offers lovely views of the River Avon. After a very comfortable sleep in our lodge we headed back over to the banquetting hall for breakfast. This was very much a similar experience as dinner albeit without any interruptions from medieval knights. Food on offer at breakfast was your standard fare of continental and cooked with coffee machines replacing the soft drink fountains. In short After breakfast we decided to check out of the lodge move our bags to the car and make our way over to the Castle. One nice touch about the Knight’s Village is that there’s a dedicated entrance way to the main castle grounds accessible by either your lodge’s keycard or – as we used – a temporary keycard for those who had already checked out. It’s about a ten minute walk from the Knight’s Village to the Castle and without going in to a full review about Warwick Castle itself there’s a whole lot to see so make use of the two day pass that comes included with all overnight stays. One thing we would say is that although Warwick Castle is fantastic for kids it is very commercialised. We’re talking medieval music being blasted out of speakers as you wander around the inner court a Now TV promotional stand in the shape of a castle tower and burger stands galore. As someone who grew up just 5 minutes from the castle it’s changed a lot since I was a child and although not necessarily a bad thing for tourists it’s a bit OTT for my delicate sensibilities. If you or one of your children have an interest in history an overnight stay in one of Warwick Castle’s lodges is a no-brainer.  Prices are reasonable and two day’s worth of castle tickets are almost worth the price of admission just by themselves. everything might be a bit overly commercialised and Disney-esque in its approach but if that’s what needed to ignite a child’s interest in history then you won’t hear any complaints from me.

1620765250.307078,29164483,https://newpol.org/review/looking-back-at-maoism-%e2%80%a8and-the-global-left/,"Looking Back at Maoism and the Global Left (New Politics Vol. XVIII No. 2 As against nearly a century of debates over Stalinism the international left has never come to terms with Maoism especially its global impact. Disillusionment with Stalinism is marked by clear dates in international politics: the Hitler-Stalin Pact of 1939 that launched World War II the suppression of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 the crushing of the Prague Spring in 1968. These events are well remembered and sometimes debated in this journal and elsewhere. With Maoism the following dates also mark tragic events for the global left yet they have not gotten the attention they deserve: the collapse of the Maoist Indonesian Communist Party in 1965 due to miscalculations that brought on murderous repression by the military with the help of the CIA China’s rapprochement with U.S. imperialism in 1971-1972 as Nixon was carpet-bombing Vietnam and embarking upon his reelection campaign the Maoist Khmer Rouge’s autogenocide or Mao’s lean toward South Africa and Mobutu’s Zaire against African revolutionaries in 1975-1976. To be sure the fact that these Maoist-impacted events took place in the Global South rather than Western and Central Europe goes some distance toward explaining the relative lack of attention. But that is no reason to continue such a marginalization today. Maoism became a pole of attraction in the 1960s for the Black Panthers and Students for a Democratic Society in the United States for a number of African revolutionaries and nationalists and for the French far left among others. Many saw Maoist China as the product of a successful socialist revolution carried out by people of color. And while it gradually lost its sheen as an international phenomenon this came not so much with a bang as a whimper without the furious debates that marked 1939 and 1968. The fact that there was no clear reckoning has helped the ideological influence of Maoism to persist to this day One example can be found in the structuralist and post-structuralist theories that have impacted so many academic fields. These theories pushed for a concentration on what orthodox Marxists termed the superstructure especially its cultural and ideological dimensions. Here the affinity with Maoism lies not merely in the fact that some of the intellectuals associated with structuralism and post-structuralism were influenced by Maoism or Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida early on. Their affinity with Maoism also lies in an indisputable theoretical point that Maoist thought sought to displace structure with superstructure most famously with the Cultural Revolution. A second example is the extreme voluntarism of Maoism from slogans like “Dare to Struggle Dare to Win” or “U.S. Imperialism Is a Paper Tiger” to adventurism or worse in the sphere of revolutionary politics: the Indonesian Communist Party while few on the activist left today identify with Maoism aside from groups like the Naxalites in India the Maoist parties in Nepal or the Communist Party of the Philippines its voluntaristic spirit persists in more subtle and indirect ways in some of the far reaches of Antifa and anarchism. This continuity makes Julia Lovell’s brilliant book important for the left and not just in historical terms. While there are countless histories of international Communism focusing on the parties and intellectuals associated with Stalinism from the 1920s onward Lovell’s book fills an important gap as the first comprehensive history of Maoism as a global phenomenon. It is the product of archival research and of a careful synthesis of previous scholarship. Lovell is not part of the radical left but an academic historian whose book is nonetheless of paramount importance for us. And some of her findings are eye-opening. One of these concerns the gestation of Edgar Snow’s hagiographic 1937 account of Maoism just after the Long March . Lovell shows that Snow’s book was choreographed and closely edited by Mao and other party officials: “Snow’s English transcript of the translator’s version of Mao’s words” was “translated into Chinese then translated back into English” (76). As the book progressed party representatives continued to shape its narrative: “As Snow toiled on turning notes into copy through the winter of 1936 his interviewees continued to send him a stream of amendments: telling him to remove any trace of dissent with Comintern policy to expunge any praise for out-of-favor Chinese intellectuals to tone down criticism of political enemies turned allies to talk up anti-Japanese patriotism” (76-77). This was the first romanticization of Maoism on the part of the global left. Another key juncture Lovell elucidates is the massacre of half a million Indonesian leftists and suspected leftists in 1965 by the army and its Islamist allies with considerable assistance from the CIA. How did this transpire? It was widely known by the early 1960s that Mao had formed an alliance with the left-leaning nationalist Sukarno who had sponsored the 1954 Bandung conference of “Nonaligned” countries. Attended by Chinese but not Soviet representatives Bandung was an important marker in the birth of the third world. It was also common currency on the left that the massive legal Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) which after the Sino-Soviet split became the largest ally of China among the world’s Communist parties was caught off guard by the ferocity of the repression in 1965-1966. Indonesia was also seen at the time as the greatest debacle of Maoism as an international movement by the independent revolutionary left which noted that the PKI did not act substantially differently from the pro-Moscow Communist parties in opportunistically sidling up to a nationalist dictator without building up enough of an independent political or military capacity. But the truth turns out to be more complicated—and more damning to Mao. The events leading up to the PKI-led abortive insurrection and the brutal repression that followed have long been shrouded in secrecy. Lovell does not succeed in fully cracking this secrecy given the Chinese regime’s suppression of its own history. Nonetheless she marshals enough evidence to confirm that the defeat of the Indonesian left lay at Mao’s doorstep as much as that of the PKI leadership and that the PKI’s disastrous miscalculations were impacted by Mao’s own voluntarism. To demonstrate this Lovell reproduces a version of an August 1965 conversation between Mao and PKI leader D.N. Aidit in which Mao calls upon Aidit to “act quickly” against the conservative army leaders at a time when Sukarno’s ailing health placed the PKI alliance with him in jeopardy (178). If this is true Mao made a strategic miscalculation on a par with Stalin’s decision not to allow German Communists to ally with the Social Democrats as Hitler was coming to power. Be that as it may the ideological influence of Maoism on the PKI was equally deleterious. alluding to Mao’s disastrous effort to transform the Chinese countryside via “People’s Communes ” which caused the mass famine of the late 1950s “In the voluntarist style of the Great Leap Forward Aidit began to eschew the kind of careful patient mobilization that had taken place through the 1950s in favor of statements that emphasized high Maoism’s ‘spirit and enthusiasm’” (168). And while Aidit talked of organizing a paramilitary force to counter the regular army and Sukarno did so as well and China promised vast amounts of armaments nothing substantial was actually done even as PKI rhetoric against the military escalated. Then acting with apparent Chinese encouragement moved to incapacitate the military leadership. They killed a number of generals but the action quickly backfired due to lack of support on the streets or within the military especially after the ailing Sukarno refused to join their cause. All this allowed the remaining Indonesian generals to orchestrate one of the greatest political massacres in history and to set up a conservative anti-labor regime that persists today in modified form in a somewhat more democratic polity. A second revelation on Lovell’s part concerns Mao’s relationship with Pol Pot and what is sometimes called the Cambodian autogenocide when up to two million people—a quarter of the population—died from starvation and executions during the years 1975-1979. The U.S. war in Vietnam which Nixon extended to Cambodia in 1970 had led to massive bombings that killed a large number of civilians. As peasants fled the bombs raining down on rural areas where the Khmer Rouge—essentially the Cambodian Communist Party—was based the population of the cities swelled making famine a real possibility. When the U.S. war effort collapsed in 1975 Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge took power and evacuating virtually the entire population at gunpoint. This was part of a harebrained scheme inspired by Maoist projects like the Great Leap Forward to empty the cities and build “socialism” in the countryside based upon a precipitous increase in the working day along with minimal food allowances. It all came crashing down as Vietnam invaded in 1979 and installed a more rational version of Stalinism closer to the Soviet version to which it was allied. While the fact that the Khmer Rouge was inspired by Maoism has been known for decades Lovell puts a point on it: “The evacuation of the cities was an extreme version of Cultural Revolution-era rustification. The creation of the mess halls and the abolition of family dining replicated the collectivization of the Great Leap Forward” (255). Moreover she shows that Maoist China was deeply committed to the Pol Pot regime awarding it the biggest aid package Beijing had ever offered $1 billion in grants and interest-free loans. Even the black cloth for the pajama-like uniforms imposed by the regime was imported from China. In 1975 soon after the Khmer Rouge came to power but after they had completely evacuated the cities at gunpoint top leaders Pol Pot and Ieng Sary met privately with Mao. During their conversation “We approve of you! Many of your experiences are better than ours ” to which Pol Pot replied “The works of Chairman Mao have led our entire party” (241). The aging and infirm Mao who had only a year to live seemingly felt thwarted by the way he had been forced to call off the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. He also stated “What we wanted to do but could not manage you are achieving” (241). Pol Pot expressed similar sentiments three years later but with the suggestion that he had outdone even Mao: “Mao stopped his Cultural Revolution but we have a Cultural Revolution every day” (259). The horrors of the Khmer Rouge regime led to a rude awakening for many left-wing intellectuals who had embraced Maoism as a more militant and anti-bureaucratic alternative to Russian Stalinism especially in France. Foucault and others now distanced themselves not only from Maoism but also from Marxism altogether. In this era the Parisian New Philosophers targeted “totalitarianism” in such a way that they were unable to support genuinely left-wing movements like the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua all the while taking inspiration from the gifted but very right-wing Russian writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. All of this helped usher in something like neoconservatism in France. The chapter on Africa chronicles a remarkable and sustained commitment on Maoist China’s part to support African nationalists and revolutionaries in the 1960s almost always in competition with the Soviet Union. China gained substantial support via Julius Nyerere’s Tanzania one of the few African countries liberated in the first wave of independence movements to avoid either right-wing military-strongman rule (Congo-Kinshasa[Zaire] Ghana) or ostensibly left-wing authoritarianism (Congo-Brazzaville a form of rural socialism and who supported liberation movements in southern Africa as the leader of the chief “front-line” African state in the struggle with apartheid South Africa received considerable Chinese aid. So did Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe African National Union an avowedly Marxist revolutionary party that later established a brutal left-wing dictatorship. Lovell highlights these relationships and paints a much more positive portrait of Maoist policy toward Africa than other regions. This has some validity given accomplishments like the Tan-Zam railway completed in 1975 at tremendous cost to the Chinese and which freed Zambian copper mines from economic dependence upon South Africa by creating a rail line through Tanzania. But Lovell ignores completely Maoist China’s greatest failure in Africa one that sullied its reputation within the global left almost as much as did the horrors of the Khmer Rouge regime. This was the Angola war of 1975 which took place as this mineral-rich southern African country was prying itself loose from Portuguese colonialism. Over the years the People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) became the most left-wing and deeply rooted of the country’s African liberation movements. But because the MPLA was backed by the Soviet Union China from the 1960s onward supported the more right-wing National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) which based itself in Mobutu’s Zaire. Mobutu one of Africa’s most reactionary and kleptocratic rulers had come to power by orchestrating the assassination of renowned African liberation leader Patrice Lumumba. Portugal began to pull out of Angola and its other colonies in 1975 having experienced in 1974 its own left-wing revolution to overthrow a fascist regime in power since the 1920s. Portuguese revolutionary officers who had themselves been radicalized by contact with African revolutionaries sought to hand over power to the MPLA. At this point UNITA (and another smaller right-wing nationalist group) made a bid for power backed not only by Mobutu and the United States but also by apartheid South Africa which dispatched troops into southern Angola. This placed China on the same side as South Africa. When UNITA and South Africa suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of some 36 000 Cuban troops sent over with Soviet aid that humiliation was also China’s as Mao now found himself exposed to the world as an ally of South Africa. For those on the left with the strongest commitments to African and Third World liberation China’s betrayal of the African liberation movement in Angola became a point of no return. Tragically hardened by the long decades of civil war with the U.S.-funded UNITA that followed devolved into an authoritarian and kleptocratic state. Still Mao’s support for forces allied with South Africa played a role in the disillusionment with Maoism across many sectors of the left especially those involved in Black liberation. For some this resulted in a disillusionment with Marxism It is not surprising that Lovell is on surer footing when analyzing Maoism’s impact on nearby countries like Indonesia or Cambodia than in discussing Africa. Still she is to be commended for having written the first survey of Maoism as a global project. Overall this is a work of deep scholarship and careful judgment. It contains a wealth of material indispensable for the twenty-first-century left to consider if we are to avoid the terrible mistakes of the past. And given the fact that Maoism—or at least theoretical and political patterns similar to or derived from it—persists today from some forms of academic radicalism to some tendencies in the activist left this book also speaks to us today if one is able to read it with an expansive frame of mind. is Professor of Sociology at the University of California Santa Barbara. He is the author of Marx at the Margins: On Nationalism A Leftist Perspective on China’s Environmental Destruction right? Isn’t that worth a few bucks -maybe more?  Please timely analysis unswerving in its commitment to struggles for peace has called “socialism” for a half-century. Looking Back at Maoism and the Global Left Taking into consideration George Orwell’s observation that ‘it was only after the Soviet regime became unmistakably totalitarian that English [and not just English] intellectuals began to show an interest in it’ it does not augur well for the Maoists’ democratic pretensions that they decided to abandon their allegiance to the Soviet Union only after the worst aspects of Stalin’s rule had been wound up under his successors. A very interesting review of a very important book. However one point needs to be corrected. Kevin Anderson says “UNITA and South Africa suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of some 36 000 Cuban troops sent over with Soviet aid.” But Cuba’s internationalist solidarity was an independent decision of Cuba’s revolutionary leadership personnel and materials in Cuba’s possession. This must be emphasised because large sections of the left in imperialist countries still believe that Cuba was acting as the Soviet Union satellite or pawn.

1620765265.37103,24639192,https://pc.net/news/2017-06-09/apple_airpods_review,When Apple announced the AirPods last fall I wasn't too excited.  I didn't understand why there was so much news coverage about them.  I didn't get why so many people rushed to preorder them.  They're just wireless headphones I decided it was time to invest in some new headphones.  I had recently bought my pair to use with them.  I looked at a few options and did some research.  The AirPods which I had previously been disinterested in rose to the top of my list.  I went to buy some at the Apple Store and of course they did not have any in stock.  I put in my order and received the AirPods about a month later. I've been using the AirPods for about a month and they are simply amazing.  Why? Here are three reasons: The AirPods sound incredible.  They are as good if not better than the Lightning headset that comes with the iPhone 7.  They have crystal clear highs and surprisingly full bass.  The overall frequency response is smooth and they don't hurt my ears even after long periods of listening. the built-in microphone works great and I often use the AirPods to make calls with my iPhone.  So far everyone says the sound quality and their end is really good.  Occassionally I get a little static or breakup in the signal because of the but it is rare.  Overall the AirPods serve as a convenient alternative to a wired headset. the AirPods are meticulously designed.  They are as small as possible while still providing great sound and good battery life.  Most importantly they don't fall out.  I have walked and cross trained with the AirPods and they haven't fallen out once.  The only time they have come out of my ears accidentally is when I am changing shirts.  (It's actually pretty difficult to remove a shirt without removing your AirPods a the same time.) My only gripe when working out is that it takes awhile to start my music on my Apple Watch (since I don't carry my with me).  I have to reselect my Apple Watch as the music source every time since it is not the option.  The Bluetooth connection also drops occasionally when I am on the edge of the reception distance from my iPhone in the locker room.  Both of these issues are more related to the Apple Watch than the iPhone but they take away from what would otherwise be a perfect user experience. the sleekness of the AirPods combined with their integration with the Apple Watch makes them the ideal choice for listening to some tunes while running or working out.  There is simply no other solution that is more lightweight.  Below are two photos comparing my previous running gear to my new solution.  Before I had an iPod nano Apple headphones with BudFits ear hooks and a chest strap heart rate monitor.  Now I have AirPods and Apple Watch. This is technological progress at its finest. The best feature of the AirPods is the battery — well actually the three batteries.  Each AirPod has a tiny battery that supports up to 24 hours of wireless usage.  That is incredible when you consider how small the AirPods are and then how much smaller the battery is within each headphone. The AirPods case doubles as a standalone charger and therefore also includes a battery.  Each time you put the AirPods in the case they automatically recharge.  This makes these headphones perfect for working out at the gym.  I just place the AirPods in their case after my workout and throw the case in my workout bag.  Each time I start my workout the AirPods are fully charged.  After a month of working out three times a week for about 45 minutes the case still had some charge left.  I only have to charge the case about once a month which is much less often and much more convenient than I expected. Apple was not overstating the truth when they announced they reinvented the headphone.  These wireless headphones are futuristic compared to every other option available.  I've been working out for over a decade and I've never worn headphones because I've found them intrusive and annoying.  Now I'm actually listening to music as I work out and it's entirely because of the AirPods and Apple Watch. Please enable JavaScript to view the ,[],No,, 
1620765270.2227519,3453798,"https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/144,000","The Last Judgement - Fresco in the that has a special religious significance for many Christians because of its use in the biblical where it is connected to a selected elect who will attain salvation. The figure 144 000 appears three times in the : Rev. 7:3-8; Rev. 14:1; and Rev. 14:3-5. These passages have been interpreted in different ways. Some groups place a high degree of importance on this literal number while others see it as a symbolic amount denoting a mystical significance. The spectrum of Christian theological views on the meaning of 144 000 is quite diverse. In general four viewpoints prevail: 1) either 144 000 is a symbolic number representing all of God's chosen people to be raised up to spend eternity in heaven with ; 2) it may refer to a literal 144 000 people who will be chosen from the tribes of Israel (12 000 from each tribe) to be saved; 3) it may denote a 144 000 people from ""spiritual Israel"" to be be saved; or finally 4) it may have a deeper mystical significance and symbolic meaning that is too obscure to be understood. 000 is also significant in some New Age religious movements. 000 is mentioned three times in the in the context of an eschatological struggle between good and evil. Within this struggle a designated group of humans (144 000) are especially enumerated for God's blessings and redemption. The three specific biblical passages that mention the 144 ""Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees until after we have sealed the servants of God on their foreheads."" And I heard the number of the sealed a hundred and forty-four thousand sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel: 000 from the tribe of Judah were sealed 000 from the tribe of Reuben 000 from the tribe of Gad 000 from the tribe of Asher 000 from the tribe of Naphtali 000 from the tribe of Manasseh 000 from the tribe of Simeon 000 from the tribe of Levi 000 from the tribe of Issachar 000 from the tribe of Zebulun 000 from the tribe of Joseph 000 from the tribe of Benjamin were sealed."" on Mount Zion stood the Lamb 000 who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads."" ""And they were singing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and before the elders. No one could learn that song except the 144 000 who had been redeemed from the earth. For it is these who have not defiled themselves with women . It is these who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These have been redeemed from mankind as first fruits for God and the Lamb and in their mouth no lie was found 000 are variously interpreted in traditional Christianity. Some taking the numbers in Revelation to be symbolic believe it represents all of God's people throughout history in the heavenly Church. 000 are literal numbers and that the 144 000 people who are descendants of (also called Israel in the Bible) have a distinct role at the time of the 000 people will be raised to heaven and will thus spend eternity with God. They do not believe that this number necessarily comes from descendants of Jacob and those of Jehovah's Witnesses who profess to be ""anointed"" or (""spiritual Israel""). 000 have been selected by God from the time of Jesus' apostles through to today.

1620765275.4227734,26048105,https://catto.ushistory.org/catto-and-american-civil-rights/catto-and-his-times-and-leadership/,Philadelphia and America’s Civil Rights Legacy Catto and His Times and Leadership Amy Cohen’s Catto the Forgotten Hero Catto and His Times and Leadership one must not only explore the accomplishments of his life but also delve into the context of his times. We often shape our view of historical figures by seeing them within our contemporary times. The drawback to this approach is that we are overlooking the way individuals lived in the world they lived in and how that world shaped who they became. We sometimes also attribute things to individuals that are not appropriate or are ahistorical. To some extent this has happened to Catto whom some today call “the Martin Luther King of his times”. By defining Catto in this way we do not understand how the worlds within which both men lived differed and also how the forces and events of their worlds shaped the men differently. This does not mean that comparisons cannot be made between King and Catto but what it does mean is that we should look deeply as to what makes them unique characters of their times and how each uniquely contributed to America’s civil rights history. This perspective also helps to enlarge our understanding of the trajectory of America’s civil rights story. This approach helps us to better understand what Martin Luther King meant when he said: “The arc of the moral universe is long but it bends towards justice.” It is through the timeline of history that we can better understand why it took over 80 years after Catto’s assassination for landmark Supreme Court case to declare Jim Crow in public education illegal and over 90 years for the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to outlaw the discriminatory voting practices adopted in southern states after the Civil War when the Constitution granted voting rights in 1870. We can also better appreciate how Catto and his generation bent the moral universe towards justice by putting in place the Constitutional laws and frameworks that made the Modern Civil Rights Movement possible. Additionally that it was the continuing struggle by African Americans and their allies over the next 90 years that forced more the realization of the justice Catto sought. This lens then also enables us to better understand the unfinished work that remained at the assassination of Martin Luther King. Catto’s world differed from King’s. Catto’s identity and although he was a religious man groomed by his religious father Catto’s social activism was not rooted in religious beliefs like Martin Luther King’s. How he sought and defined justice reflected his secular Victorian world. The years following Catto’s death produced another environment that created the social gospel philosophy of Martin Luther King. King’s deep religious faith and his vocation as a minister embraced this philosophy and produced King’s unique brand of social theory. The environment also produced legends of African American civil rights activists and important organizations. Octavius Valentine Catto was born into a free black family with privilege and social connections in South Carolina but also extending into the North. He came of age during the Victorian era in America a time known for strict standards of personal morality and class structure. It was also the age of Horatio Alger a novelist known as the father of the American Dream and whose books espoused “pulling oneself up by their bootstraps”. The Catto family left South Carolina initially hoping that his father William Catto a millwright (comparable to a civil engineer today) and would become a missionary in Liberia. Unfortunately William Catto’s dream vanished because the Presbytery in South Carolina thought he was promoting anti-slavery sentiments and possibly violence. Fearing his life William Catto moved his family northward and eventually to the Philadelphia area where there were with family connections both in Philadelphia and New Jersey. Pennsylvania and New Jersey had abolished slavery by 1804 and both were strong areas for abolition and Underground Railroad activities. Octavius Catto received a classical “private” school (pay tuition) education comparable to that given white elites during his time. He eventually was enrolled in the Institute for Colored Youth which provided one of the finest educations possible for black students. His family was also part of the black elite class educators and intellectuals. The Cattos lived in a vibrant and politically active northern black community that had established important founding black institution like St. Thomas African Episcopal Church long before they arrived. These black elites were vocal social activists dating back before the nation’s founding. The Philadelphia black community also built and maintained strong connections with other black communities throughout the North as well as with some southern communities. By Octavius’ formative years Philadelphia was central to the abolition movement and in 1856. When Catto was 17 Philadelphia became central in the formation of the Republican Party when the party’s first convention was held there. Catto’s world connected him to the most important ideas and issues of his day and provided an environment that nurtured and expanded his thinking as well as shaped his core beliefs in what he should expect of and for himself as well as from others. As a well-educated young black adult he knew that he had an obligation to become a leader. Catto would later state this core belief in a commencement speech at the Institute for Colored Youth in 1864 when he spoke of “…the immense debt which those…that led the civilized world owe to their educated men…”. when he graduated from the Institute of Colored Youth at age 19 in 1858 he was expected by his family to take his place as a leader. This was not unique to Catto. Other children among Philadelphia’s black elites shared the similar view. This world view included the following elements: particularly in education. They believed that they belonged in America and that blacks can become accomplished through education. They also believed that elite blacks were not lesser than poor whites but equal to whites in the middle class. Education as the path to upward mobility. (They put an emphasis on expanding public education and often pursued education a career.) Citizenship rights are deserved due to accomplishments. Social and political access on par with white middle class is deserved due to accomplishments. But at the same time these individuals were strong advocates for black institutions led by blacks. In addition to the above elements Catto and most blacks believed manhood rights for black men were a primary concern. The Victorian era placed strong emphasis on the central role of men and protectiveness over their families. In Victorian American manhood wasexpressed in a belief in the superiority of the “civilized world” and sporting competition (“to educate one’s mind one had to educate one’s body”). In the social context of whites black males were often viewed as lacking in the ability to participate in society in these ways due to their perceived inferiority. Catto’s words in the 1864 Alma Mater speech highlight his concerns: “The colored man…has within him an aspiration and capability to rise by faith and perseverance to a respectable place among his competitors…the intelligent foreigner and migrating Northerner.” Catto’s social world molded him to be a social justice radical and an activist while at the same time he embraced many Victorian sensibilities. He worked to break down racial barriers that limited black access to Philadelphia streetcars in military service during the Civil War and to cultural institutions like the Franklin Institute. His efforts to broaden black participation in early base ball reflected his belief not in integration but a belief that black teams should be allow to compete against white base ball clubs. Catto strongly advocated for the rights of “deserving” educated black men to enable other blacks to rise (“pull up by their bootstraps”) through their education and contribute to the “civilized world”. He was not a strong vocal advocate for women to have equitable status with men. However he worked side by side with many women to expand rights for black men and was protective of women who were not treated in the way their social class would entitle them if they were of the white race. He supported the education of women to be trained as teachers an acceptable Victorian occupation for women. There are no surviving records showing that he supported the advanced training of Institute for Colored Youth female alums like Rebecca Cole and Caroline Still Anderson who went on to become early African American medical doctors. There is evidence that he resented Fanny Coppin’s appointment as head of the Institute for Colored Youth over him even though her education credential were superior to his. Catto’s most significant leadership can be demonstrated through his work in the Pennsylvania Equal Rights League an arm of the National Equal Rights League. It is here as an officer and leader in the League that Catto worked side-by-side with other national level African American men like Frederick Douglass John Mercer Langston and Henry Highland Garnet. The Pennsylvania League was also among the most influential of the affiliates that form the National Equal Rights League. Both the national organization and the Pennsylvania affiliate were founded in 1864 in response to the systematic segregation and exclusion long affecting nearly every aspect of black northern lives. During Catto’s time 000 African Americans living in northern states by 1870. Of these 000 lived in Pennsylvania and blacks made up 1.9% of the state population. In Philadelphia systemic racism was also strongly felt because citizenship rights and privileges had been stripped away from black men when the state enlarged the franchise for white men and barred previous black voters of the franchise. The justification was that “all men are free and equal” but this did not apply to black citizens in a political sense “only in a sense of nature”…black men should not be able to vote as they do not have any “conceptions of civil liberty.” This was Catto’s racially defined world. The work of Catto and his peers in the Pennsylvania League was motivated in part by a growing spirit of optimism and patriotism generated by the emancipation and the recruitment of black troops in the Union Army during the Civil War. Their effort in recruiting United States Colored Troops and training some 11 000 troops at Camp William Penn was a significant contribution to the Civil War effort. The 8 612 troops recruited from Pennsylvania were the most African American troops from any northern area in the country. The recruitment work also enabled the League members to forge important alliance with white allies (particularly in the Union League of Philadelphia) who advanced their efforts to achieve legal equality through the 13th 14th and 15th Amendments. In these alliances Catto and his peers sought to reassure white leaders that African Americans were law-abiding moral people who wanted neither “to lower the standards of refinement nor to disrupt the society nor achieve integrated social equality”. League members spoke about “strict standards of personal morality.” They also believed in and supported a form of black nationalism through black-led and operated institutions. At the same time many members expressed their concerns about alienating their white customers if they opened their business to serve blacks. Connected to this work and the alliances he forged therein Catto took on leadership roles in an all-black brigade in the Pennsylvania National Guard formed by General Louis Wagner the white officer who oversaw Camp William Penn and through the Republican Party in a Reconstruction assignment in Washington D.C. to establish schools for the newly freedmen. Catto’s imprint on the latter was important in creating the school that became the premier black high school in the country the M Street School (later Dunbar High School) whose notable graduates included civil rights activists Sadie Tanner and Charles Hamilton Houston (the “Man Who Killed Jim Crow”). The school would also provide employment for the likes of Carter G. Woodson the Father of Black History before he moved to become a professor at Howard University. Catto and his associates’ secular vision of equality was complicated. On the one hand it challenged the racial sentiments of Victorian whites by ascribing the expansion of citizenship rights for black men but they rooted their reasoning in Victorian models of manhood and accomplishment. They strove to be able to build and maintain strong black institution but they realized that there were limits to achieving full social integration. They were also adamant about civic integration…the ability to participate in public spaces. Their secular vision equality had its limits when it came to black women. Catto’s reform efforts were ultimately defeated by Southern white intransigence and violence as well as Northern white indifference neglect and violence. It was Northern white race violence that took his life. Nonetheless Catto and associates put the 13th 14th and 15th Amendments “on the books” the U.S. Constitution. These amendments changed the meaning to the Constitution forever and produced what historian Eric Foner calls the “Second American Revolution”. These amendments are what Charles Sumner called “Sleeping Giants”. Catto also left an enduring mark on the trajectory of black education in the United States. Following Catto’s assassination on October 10 black civil rights activism in the years between Catto and MLK focused on anti-violence and lynching and black agency and nationalism. One can only posit what more Catto would have contributed if not for his premature death or whether his world view would have changed as the nation moved into the 20th Century. V.

They wore the yellow safety vests the government requires all motorists to purchase and which immediately became the emblem of the movement.  That week and the next Yellow Vests also ventured into the heart of Paris blocking the gilded Boulevard Champs-Elysées and almost reaching the nearby presidential palace.  From the beginning women were unusually prominent in the local occupations and the street marches.  At the same time the Yellow Vests chased away many politicians who visited their protest sites including some from the left.

Marx’s Capital After 150 Years: Revolutionary Reflections What does it mean to celebrate and concretize for today Marx’s greatest work Vol. I? Such a discussion is terribly important at this juncture when we are in a new situation where even some sectors of the right have started to attack neoliberalism. The Brexit vote in the UK the large vote for Le Pen in France despite her eventual defeat by a neoliberal candidate the Trump campaign have placed on the agenda a new form of right-wing populism with neofascist overtones that breaks with some key features of neoliberalism such as free trade pacts and “humanitarian” intervention.  At the same time Trump as president has put forth an incoherent agenda that contains major continuities with neoliberal austerity and old-style militarism above all in the attempt to gut Obamacare. Trump’s Nuclear Threats Against North Korea and Iran Pose Existential Crisis for Humanity U.S. President Donald Trump crossed to new stage in the annals of warmongering in his United Nations speech of September 19 when he declared “The United States has great strength and patience but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.” This threat to incinerate an entire nation of 25 million people amounts to nothing less than genocide.

The Imperialist Logic Behind Trump's Attack on Syria And the Assad Regime's War Crimes Within a few days in April the Trump administration pivoted away from its nearly open support for the Assad regime to a military attack on it.

The Japanese language will be completely replaced by made the announcement on the first day of the month ""The leadership of Japan has unanimously voted to use emojis as our primary written language going forward.""  He said ""We have been planning this change for several years and we believe now is the right time."" Instead of using complex symbols to depict words and phrases Japanese people will simply be able to tap emojis on a keyboard.  For example ""love"" can now be written with a simple heart emoji instead of the complicated Kanji character ""It makes a lot of sense a Japanese reporter who has been following the developments over the past several years.  ""Japanese is such a tricky language.  You have three different written scripts – hiragana and kanji – just for one language.  It's too much.""  She explained ""If we're going to simplify the language to one writing system emojis is the logical choice."" The announcement coincides with the upcoming release of Unicode 10.0 the new character set coming this summer that will include over 2 000 emojis (up from the 1 851 existing ones in Unicode 9.0).  Apparently 000 emojis was the threshold where Japanese officials felt it was safe to move to an entirely emoji-based language. When asked how he felt about the change Japanese official Yuji Kawasaki gave this written statement: While many Japanese people are thrilled with the change others have expressed reservations.  80-year-old Kayoko Honda said ""I spent years learning the Japanese language.  I don't feel like starting over. ☹️""  Hayata Toyota stated ""I guess this marks the end of the pen and paper for Japan.""  He continued ""We'll all have to use electronic devices just to communicate.  I guess we're already doing that In an effort to keep Japanese culture and heritage alive for future generations the educational panel has made an effort to keep some traditional writing classes in the curriculum.

The attempt to encourage a coup d'état to allow imposing retired Gen. Fazlollah Zahedi and Imperial Guard Col. Nematollah Nassiri as the government. This deposition of a formerly elected civil government saw the return to power of the pro-Western Shah whose dictatorial rule continued until the Iranian Revolution of 1979. The coup was a incident; it was feared that Mosaddeq's government would shift Iran into the The coup was precipitated when Mosaddeq nationalized Iran's which had been owned and run by the British since 1908 with hardly any revenue benefiting Iran. In the Operation Ajax (originally viewed as a triumph of covert action) is now regarded as a mistake that has compromised U.S.'s ability to defend around the world. Reasons given for why the coup occurred include significant domestic dissatisfaction with the Mossadegh government (especially within the Iranian military) and a CIA propaganda campaign. Motivations given for the foreign coup planners include desire to control Iranian fields and more benign concerns over Iran's coming under the control of the Soviet bloc of Iran's traditional enemy had risen to power promising to reduce foreign influence in Iran. In the first half of the twentieth century Iran had been more or less run from the the leaders of the 1979 revolution condemned the Shah as a puppet of the decadent West. With other examples of Britain and the U.S. supporting non- the legacy of the Mosaddeq coup makes the task of spreading around the world harder to achieve since the real intent of intervention by the Western powers with no genuine concern for the people of the country concerned. The principal cause (among others) of (the coup d'état) was Western (American and European) dispute over the nationalization of the between the Imperial British government and the civil Iranian government. sought to pay debts owed to by granting a 60-year petroleum search concession to William Knox D'Arcy. These debts were in the main due to the Shah's extravagant life-style. The exploration took seven years but yielded an enormous oil field—from which Persia would receive only 16 per cent of the future profits. when Persia's strategic importance led the British Government to buy a controlling share in the company essentially nationalizing British oil production in Iran for a short time becoming the Royal Navy's chief fuel source in defeating the Central Powers; British soldiers occupied Persia's strategic parts.
Not only did Britain control the oil but it treated Iran as if it were a colony; the country was governed from the British and Russian embassies so that even nominations for membership of the (Assembly} were controlled by the ambassadors who each handed a list to the Prime Minister. The Persians were dissatisfied with the British oil concession and the royalty terms whereby Persia only received 16 per cent of and with the degree of influence exercised by Britain over Iran's government. The dissatisfaction was exacerbated when the British tried to use Iran to attack Russia to overturn the a British military coup d'état enthroned Reza Pahlavi as Shah of Persia who then undertook modernization advantageous to the British and the Persians such as the Persian Corridor railroads for military and civil transport. courted the Shah for secure access to oil for their war effort. The Shah turned to Germany to counter British influence but he was also influenced by Nazi ""phrases and methods which suited his dictatorial and nationalistic aspirations."" For his part declared that Iran was a ""a pure Aryan country."" On the ""eve of Iran housed German agents and the government had economic and political commitments tying it to a pro-German policy."" The Shah ended the APOC's concession and resettled it within a year: A reduced drilling area and increased Persian government profit from its natural resources. decreed that foreign delegates use the country term ""Iran"" instead of ""Persia"" in formal correspondence; the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC) became the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC). after the Nazi invasion of Russia securing the Persian Corridor supply lines for the Soviet-Nazi fight in the Eastern Front and Iranian oil fields for the they deposed the supposedly ""pro-Nazi"" Reza Shah and enthroned his twenty-two-year-old son a constitutional monarchy since 1906 nationalist leaders became powerful in seeking reduction of long-term foreign intervention in their country—especially the greatly-profitable British oil concession. In particular the AIOC's refusal to allow auditing of accounts to determine whether or not the Iranian government was being paid its due royalties in full. The AIOC's refusal escalated nationalist demands to: An the crisis was the AIOC's closing rather than accepting Iranian government ""interference"" in its business. The AIOC and the Iranian government resisted nationalist pressure for a renewed deal in 1949. the AIOC's resistance to re-negotiating their petroleum concession—and increasing the royalty paid to Iran—created popular support for nationalizing the company; the nationalization impulse was not only strong the pro-Western P.M. Ali Razmara was assassinated; the next month the parliament legislated the petroleum industry's nationalization by creating the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC). This legislation was guided by the Western-educated Dr. Mohammed Mosaddeq then a member of the Iranian parliament and leader of the nationalization movement; by May the Shah had appointed Mosaddeq Prime Minister. Commenting that Mosaddeq had opposed his father's appointment as Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi explained that though wary of Mosaddeq's brand of nationalism and of his ""violent anti-British sentiment"" he believed that his experience was needed at this time of crises. He also hoped that he would be cautious in asserting Iran's rights since the ""path to political and economic independence was full of pitfalls."" American diplomat W. Averell Harriman went to Iran to negotiate an Anglo-Iranian compromise asking the Shah's help; his reply was that ""in the face of public opinion there was no way he could say a word against nationalization."" Harriman held a press conference in Tehran calling for reason and enthusiasm in confronting the ""nationalization crisis."" As soon as he spoke a journalist rose and shouted: ""We and the Iranian people all support Premier Mossadegh and oil nationalization!"" Everyone present began cheering and then marched out of the room; the abandoned Harriman shook his head in dismay. The National Iranian Oil Company suffered decreased production because of Iranian inexperience and the AIOC's orders that British technicians not work with them thus provoking the Abadan Crisis (the expulsion between 1951 and 1954 of Western oil company personnel from Iran) that was aggravated by the Royal Navy's blockading its export markets to Iran to not nationalize its petroleum. The Iranian revenues were greater because the profits went to Iran's national treasury rather than to private foreign oil companies. By September 1951 the British had virtually ceased Abadan oil field production forbidden British export to Iran of key British commodities (including sugar and steel) and had frozen Iran's hard currency accounts in British banks. The United Kingdom took its anti-nationalization case against Iran to the International Court of Justice at The Hague; P.M. Mossadegh said the world would learn of a ""cruel and imperialistic country"" stealing from a ""needy and naked people."" Representing the AIOC the U.K. lost its case worried about its other Iranian interests believing the misconception that Iran's nationalism was Soviet-backed. In the event they persuaded Secretary of State that Iran was falling to the Soviets—effectively exploiting the narrow American Cold War mindset—yet President never agreed to their overthrowing of Prime Minister Mohammed Mosaddeq; but they convinced him to a joint coup d'état deposing Iran's only democratically-elected government in order to re-establish foreign (British) control of Iran's petroleum. Overthrowing Mosaddegh's government was a British idea for which they asked President Truman's aid; he refused. the British asked him and he agreed to their jointly deposing the elected Iranian civil government. having decided that Iran must profit from its own petroleum acted to nationalize that natural resource previously controlled by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Britain complained the Iranian government was violating the AIOC's legal rights and headed a world-wide boycott of Iranian petroleum provoking a financial crisis for Iran's economy. supported by the U.S. and the U.K. invited Western oil companies back to exploit Iran's petroleum. ""The crushing of Iran's first democratic government ushered in more than two decades of dictatorship under the Shah who relied heavily on U.S. aid and arms "" wrote Dan De Luce in reveals the details of the coup d'état. is whether or not the Americans and the British had legitimate fears of Communist influence in Iran that might have limited their access to its petroleum. After World War II the U.S.S.R.'s Allied-agreed domain included Central Asia and much of Eastern Europe. As the Iranians nationalized their country's petroleum crossed the 38th parallel and invaded in a reunification war known in the West as the Three years later (just before the Anglo-American coup d'état against P.M. Mossadegh) the Soviets crushed an uprising of strikes and protests in East Germany. featuring the large and popular pro-Soviet Tudeh (Communist) Party which was known to receive Soviet assistance became just another part of the Cold War between Communism and ""the Free world."" [the year] 1952 was a very dangerous time. The Cold War was hot in Korea. The Soviet Union had tried to take all was still alive. On no account could the Western powers risk a Soviet takeover of Iran which would almost certainly have led to World War III. Mohammad Reza Pahlavi says that the Soviets supported Mossadeq planning to use him to overthrow the monarchy then to eliminate him ""two weeks after my departure."" Mossadeq wanted nothing more than to oust the ""Pahlavi dynasty."" during the last year of his government. Halliday points out that the anti-Mossadeq coup could only have been successful because of the weakness of his own position and the opposition of ""the dominant class:"" ""Had Mossadeq had a following that was organized and based on the oppressed in town and country the resistance to the coup would have been much more substantial than it was."" Mossadeq ""had no political organization worthy of the name."" As part of the post–coup d'état political repression of the Tudeh the imposed imperial government revealed that the party had 477 members in the Iranian armed forces: ""22 colonels none was member of the tank divisions that might have participated in the Shah's anti-democratic coup d'état; he had carefully screened them. Besides fear of Soviet influence in Iranian internal affairs the Cold War influenced the U.S. to support—or not oppose—Britain's anti-Mossadegh policy towards Iran; using British support of the U.S. campaign to isolate Iranian P.M. Mossadegh: ""Britain was supporting the Americans in Korea and had a right to expect Anglo-American unity on Iran."" a pro-American government gave the U.S. a double As a condition for restoring the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company the U.S. required collapsing the AIOC's monopoly; five American petroleum companies and the Compagnie Française des Pétroles were to draw Iran's petroleum after the successful coup d'état—Operation Ajax. the CIA organized anti-Communist guerrillas to fight the Tudeh Party if seized power in the chaos of Operation Ajax. Per released National Security Archive documents Undersecretary of State Walter Bedell Smith reported that the CIA had agreed with Qashqai tribal leaders to establish a clandestine safe haven from which U.S.-funded guerrillas and spies could operate. Operation Ajax's formal leader was senior CIA officer while career agent Donald Wilber was the operational leader and executor of the deposition of P.M. Mossadegh. The coup d'état depended on the impotent Shah's dismissing the popular and powerful Prime Minister and replacing him with Gen. with help from Col. Abbas Farzanegan—a man agreed by the British and Americans after determining his anti-Soviet politics. The BBC spearheaded Britain's propaganda campaign broadcasting the go-code launching the coup d'état against Iran's elected government. the coup d'état briefly faltered—and the Shah fled from Iran after a short Italian exile the CIA successfully returned him to Iran. Gen. Zahedi replaced the deposed Prime Minister Mosaddeq and condemned to death. Showing ""generosity of spirit "" the Shah commuted Mossadegh's death sentence to three-years' solitary confinement in a military prison followed by perpetual house arrest. newspaper partially published a censored version of the CIA document Clandestine Service History—Overthrow of Premier Mosaddeq of Iran—November 1952–August 1953 describing the planning and execution of the Anglo-American coup d'état. The newspaper published this as a scanned image An immediate consequence of the coup d'état was the political repression of National Front opposition and especially of the (Communist) Tudeh party and concentration of political power in the Shah and his courtiers. Halliday says that the Shah exercised complete political control using his secret service (SAVAK) and the military to crush anyone critical of the regime. was sharp improvement of Iran's economy; the British-led oil embargo against Iran ended and oil revenue increased significantly beyond the pre-nationalization level. Despite Iran not controlling its national oil the Shah agreed to replacing the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company with a consortium—British Petroleum and eight European and American oil companies; in result oil revenues increased from $34 million in 1954-1955 to $181 million in 1956-1957 and the United States sent development aid and advisers. The CIA maintained a presence in Iran where Soviets agents were also located. Iran also received economic aid from the Soviets According to a former Soviet agent the Shah survived at least one KGB assassination attempt when an explosive device failed to detonate. In the second half of the twentieth century the U.S. played the role that Britain had earlier in ""running"" Iran. In 1959 Iran and the U.S. signed a defense treaty. ""Iran's growth as a regional power"" went ""hand in hand with the growth of its cooperation with the U.S."" As the only state in the regional (until 1980) sympathetic towards the U.S. saw Iran as potentially a strategic ally should another conflict erupt. Halliday says that ""virtually every general officer in the Shah's army has visited Israel and hundreds of junior officers"" trained there. the sight of the Shah of Iran the country until foreigners re-enthroned him was the major cause of his deposition in the 1979 Iranian Revolution. These actions by the religious revolutionaries severed American-Iranian relations. Remembering the embassy's command-center role in the 1953 coup d'état led them to its preventive occupation in 1979. founder and president of The Future of Freedom Foundation considered the operation one of their greatest foreign policy successes—until the enormous convulsion that rocked Iranian society with the violent ouster of the Shah and the installation of a virulently anti-American Islamic regime in 1979."" paved the way for the rise to power of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and all the rest that's happened right up to 9/11 and beyond."" This view can be justified on the basis that the Shah's pro-Western policies alienated both the people of Iran and its Muslim leaders so much so that revolution became inevitable. Various legislative measures removed the Muslim scholars from judicial posts and also transferred some of their income to the State. The 1953 coup d'état was the first time the U.S. had openly overthrown an elected with ""immediate and far-reaching effect. Overnight the CIA became a central part of the American foreign policy apparatus and covert action came to be regarded as a cheap and effective way to shape the course of world events""—a coup against the elected which had nationalized farm land owned by the United Fruit Company U.S.-British support for the dictatorial rule of the Shah and their role in overthrowing Mosaddeq's government has attracted censure as an example of duplicity. In 2000 Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called it a ""setback for democratic government"" in Iran. the U.S. and Great Britain speak about their commitment to spreading democracy and to opposing tyranny; on the other hand they appear to compromise their principles when their own economic or strategic interests are threatened. With other example of these nations supporting non-democratic regimes the legacy of the anti-Mosaddeq coup makes the task of spreading freedom around the world harder to achieve since the real intent of intervention by the Western powers can be questioned. The Shah himself asked where his friends were in 1979 and why the CIA had appointed a new head of station who knew nothing about Iran or the crises it was experiencing. Constant interference by foreign powers in the internal affairs of Iran over more than a century alienated the people of Iran from the Western world. The close ties that did exist between Britain and the U.S. and Iran ought to have helped to spread better cross-cultural understanding. However the foreign powers acted in their own interests then Cold War games in Iran with little or no real concern for the welfare of the Iranian people. The Shah was perceived to pay Islam mere lip-service as he curbed the influence of the religious leaders. Islam invests the religious leaders with special authority which has found expression in the post-1979 Constitution of Iran where the supreme leader is a senior Muslim jurist.

Catto lived in the world of the 19th century African American middle class. His life was not like that of the majority of blacks in both South Carolina and Philadelphia were had marginal economic existances or were poor. Most had little or no access to education. He was born into a privileged mulatto family in Charleston South Carolina. In Philadelphia joined the black middle class which was composed of businessmen and other professionals. They were a small minority population within Philadelphia’s black community. It was this life that made Catto’s extraordinary education possible and how he built ties with black and white leaders locally and nationally. This life also opened up ways for him to become a strong advocate for justice and equality seeking to end slavery and expand for African Americans both opportunities and the rights and privileges that whites had at that time. This section features people in Catto’s world. Do you know who the ones feature here are? They are many others as well. A great learning experience is to discover them all. Bowser was an African American artist and political activist who frequently used his art to express his political views. Tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians saw his Civil War artwork in the regimental flags carried by the United States Colored Troops (USCT). Bowser’s portrait of John Brown is one of his most famous portraitures. His works were among the first African American art to be widely viewed. A member of the distinguished family of Cyris Bustill Bowser was engaged in many important civic activities including the formation of Lebanon Cemetery and the recruitment of USCT soldiers. Today but his residence at 481N. 4th Street in Philadelphia has been marked with a Pennsylvania historical marker. It is here where he hosted John Brown. LeCount was one of the five students to graduate from the Institute for Colored Youth in 1863. She had been an exemplary student who became an accomplished educator. When she was named principal of Catto Elementary school LeCount was the second African American female to be name principal of a Philadelphia public school.

A Pennsylvania historical marker honoring Fannie is on Cheyney University’s campus off Dilworthtown and Cheyney Roads. It is among the state’s oldest historical markers The Civil War was a defining moment for many in Philadelphia. It was the War that changed Boker from a Democrat to an ardent Republican embracing the party’s principals that led to the passage of the 13th 14th and 15th Amendments. Boker’s name is closely interwoven with the rehabilitation of the Republican Party in Philadelphia. When the Union League of Philadelphia was founded in 1862 Boker was the leading spirit and it was through his efforts that both sentiments and support towards the Union cause prevailed in Philadelphia. His efforts forged opportunities for Catto and other leading African American activists to forge strong alliances with leading Republican politicians of the day. From their childhood as students at the Vaux School White and Catto forged a life-long friendship. As sons of prominent Philadelphia families the two were in the same social and later political circles throughout their lives. They were outgoing energetic young men on the move! White’s father was director of the Sunday school at First African Presbyterian Church; Catto’s father was the pastor. The two young men were members of the Banneker Institute and also had formed the Pythian early base ball team together. Jacob White became a highly respected educator and the first African American school principal in Philadelphia. It is the White’s family cemetery where Catto was buried after his assassination. Mercer is the first African American to be elected to public office in the United States. In 1854 he became the first African American lawyer in Ohio. Mercer was an abolitionist educator and politician/diplomat. He and Catto worked together in the National Equal Rights League (NERL) a national network of activists working to extend black rights and suffrage in Northern states after the Civil War. Mercer led the NERL in 1864. Catto served as secretary of the Pennsylvania chapter which extended his network of associated across the country. Mercer became head of Howard Law School. At Catto’s death he gave a moving speech to the faculty at Howard Law encouraging them to continue to work on the causes Catto cared about. His great-nephew is the renown poet Langston Hughes. A historical marker honoring John Langston is on the courthouse grounds in Louisa Most well-known as a conductor on the Underground Railroad and author of his account of the Underground Railroad “The Underground Railroad Records”. Still was also a businessman and life-long civil rights activist. His book “A Brief Narrative of the Struggle for the Rights of Colored People of Philadelphia in the City Railway Cars” describes efforts to desegregate Philadelphia streetcars. As the head of the Knights of Pythian lodge Still provided support for Catto’s baseball team. His daughter Caroline Still (1848-1919) was an early graduate of Women’s Medical College and became a pioneering medical doctor working at Tuskegee Institute. A historical marker is at his residence at 244 South 12th Street Before the term “power couple” came into use in the 20th Century joint and separate activist efforts are examples in the 19th century. Daughter of James Forten Harriet was an African American abolitionist and first-generation suffragette. With Lucretia Mott she formed the first biracial female abolition society the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society. The Purvis’ efforts were funded using the fortune Robert inherited from his father. Robert was president of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society and was an officer in the American Anti-Slavery Society. At the annual meeting of the American Anti-Slavery Society Robert made a short extemporaneous speech full of fire declaring himself a “Disunion Abolitionist” over the crimes against Kansas by pro-slavery forces. He and Harriet worked jointly with Catto in the campaign to desegregate the Philadelphia transit system. Robert joined Catto in the work of the Pennsylvania Equal Rights League. Robert also served as a Commissioner of the Freedmen Bank and used his fortune to try to keep the Bank solvent. A historical marker is at Robert Purvis’ last residence at 1601 Mt. Vernon Street Philadelphia. Another historical marker honoring the Female Abolition Society stands at 5th and Arch Streets in Philadelphia in front of the U.S. Mint. Many people in the 19th century also believed that the freed people should leave the United States for Africa or the Caribbean. Not John Brown. He believed that the “Golden Rule” applied to all people and that the founding document of the United States was meant for everyone. Brown also believed slavery was such an evil that it should be ended by any means necessary. In believing that all people should be free and treated equally and with respect Brown addressed all individuals as Mister or Miss regardless of their race or position. He also believed that there was a point when one needed to stop talking and start taking action. Reason became the first African American university professor at a predominately white college in America. In 1852 he left the post at New York Central College to become principal at the Institute for Colored Youth. Two years later the young O.V. Catto came under his tutelage as a student. Reason instituted significant improvements at ICY and Catto was a beneficiary of these. Reason increased student enrollment expanded the library holdings and exposed the students to outstanding African American intellectuals and leaders of that time. Reason was also known for his activities in the cause for black equal rights and worked with Henry Garnett in the Negro Convention Movement. A child prodigy with extraordinary gifts he was also a prolific writer who wrote political journalism as well as poetry. Bassett came to Philadelphia in 1855 from Connecticut and took an appointment at the Institute of Colored Youth as principal teacher and librarian. In this role he built upon the education philosophy of Charles Reason and engaged his students with some of the leading thinkers of the day. He had a close association with John Brown and during the Civil War he was among the men with Catto and Frederick Douglass recruiting black soldiers for the USCT. When President Grant appointed him as minister to Haiti Bassett became the highest ranking African American in public service. A historical marker is at his last residence in Philadelphia at 2121 North 29th Street. Whipper believed in nonviolence and rational persuasion as a way to achieve social reform. He was a prominent member of Philadelphia’s African American community. In 1835 he became one of founding fathers of the Antislavery American Moral Reform Society. Whipper’s ideology regarding antislavery was very different than most people. He believed that prejudice against blacks came from the condition in which black people were in not due to the color of their skin. A very successful businessman with his partner Stephen Smith Whipper focused his efforts in helping black people to improve their status in society through education and economics. When the Freedman’s Bank established an operation in Philadelphia Whipper managed the office. This bank was located at 919 Lombard Street in the heart of the 7th Ward has a historical marker. Octavius Catto was the 6th depositor at the Bank. Harper is now known to be the most prolific writer of the 19th Century. She was one of the most prominent women during this period. Her writings appeared often as serials in African American publication like the Christian Recorder and the Anglo-African Magazine. An ally and friend of William Still Harper aided his Underground Railroad efforts and also worked as an educator among the freedmen during Reconstruction. In 1866 she delivered a powerful speech at the National Women’s Rights Convention along with Lucretia Mott. A historical marker is at her residence at 1006 Bainbridge Street a founder of the Free African Society in 1787 in Philadelphia Sarah Mapps was an educator and abolitionist. As an artist she often put painted images on her signed letters. Many examples of these survive today and are the earliest surviving examples of signed painting by an African American woman. At one time Sarah considered becoming a medical doctor and was the first African American women to attend the Women’s Medical College in Philadelphia. After a year she changed directions and became a teacher at the Institute for Colored Youth where she was a colleague of Octavius Catto. Sarah believed that the cultivation of intellectual powers was the greatest human pursuit along with fighting for equal rights. She was a founding member Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society along with her mother Grace. In 1855 she married William Douglass the second rector of St Thomas African Episcopal Church and a widower with nine children. More of an intellectual than an activist William Douglass led a congregation whose members included not only the wealthiest black Philadelphia families but also some of the most dominant figures in African American political life. Among these was O. V. Catto who was a vestryman at the church an ally of John Brown. Lucretia (1793- 1880) and James (1788 – 1868) Mott were a power couple. By the time of the Civil War Lucretia and James Mott were elder statespersons in the abolition movement. Lucretia also became a leading voice for women’s suffrage and she and James attended the first Women’s Rights Convention at Seneca Falls. Both were supporters of John Brown and cared for Mary Brown in their home in Philadelphia after John Brown was hanged at Harper’s Ferry. The training camp for black troops was built on land owned by Union League member Edward M. Davis the son-in-law of abolitionist Lucretia Mott. The land was adjacent to the Mott’s “roadside” estate. As the black regiments drilled they sometimes marched and saluted Lucretia Mott as she watched from her porch. A historical marker honoring Lucretia stands on PA611 at Latham Parkway Arguably the most well-known 19th century anti-slavery and equal rights activist Douglass spent considerable time in Philadelphia and was well connected in the African American community as well as among white Republicans and the Union League. Douglass work with Philadelphians on black troop recruitment and his name appears on the “Men of Color of Philadelphia” recruitment poster. As a leader in the National Equal Rights League Douglass worked with Catto to extend voting and citizenship rights to black men. Douglass was among the black leaders recognized by the Union League for their success in 1869. A Pennsylvania historical marker marks the secret meeting between Frederick Douglass and John Brown on West Washington Street A founder of the Republican Party Kelley gained national attention when he gave a speech against expanding slavery into the territories. He was considered to be a man of strict principles who advocated for the recruitment of black troops in the Civil War and for extending the franchise to them afterwards. Kelley served on the Union League Committee supporting the raising of African American troops and establishment of Camp William Penn. Along with Thaddeus Stevens Kelley use his political leverage to helped Catto end public transit segregation and achieve Pennsylvania’s ratify the 14th and 15th Amendments. Kelley also introduced a bill which gave voting rights to blacks in Washington D.C. and supported the impeachment of Andrew Jackson. The William D. Kelley public school in North Philadelphia was named in his honor. and the niece of Harriet Forten Purvis Charlotte grew up in a privileged black family in Philadelphia and New England. When her mother died in 1840 she was raised by various members of her extended family and in 1854 moved with one of her aunts to live in Salem Massachusetts. It is there she attended a private school where she was the only non-white student. In Salem she became a member of the Salem Female Anti-Slavery Society and became the first non-white person to teach white students in the public school. During the Civil War Forten was the first black teacher to work with the mission establishing schools on the South Carolina Sea Islands and began teaching freedmen. Her essays of her experiences were published in Atlantic Magazine. A historical marker is at her last residence at 1608 R Street where she lived with her husband who led Washington’s 15th Street Presbyterian Church. Rev. Grimke was active in the Niagara Movement and was a founder of the NAACP. Their home in Washington D.C. was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976. Henry Highland Garnett gave one of the most memorable eulogies to him at his New York City church Shiloh Presbyterian Church. This event was covered in the New York Times. Garnett who was a classmate of Charles Reason the first Institute for Colored Youth principal to mentor Catto also became one of Catto’s national activist associates working together in the National Equal Rights League with Frederick Douglass. In the U.S. Capitol is a picture of Garnett with Horace Greeley celebrating the passage of the 15th Amendment which granted voting rights to black men. Wagner was instrumental in the planning of the public funeral held to honor Octavius Catto. Catto’s body laid in state at the City Armory at Broad and Race Streets on October 16 1871. Wagner and Catto had become friends as they both worked on the recruitment and training of black troops. It was he who encouraged Catto to join the Pennsylvania National Guard. General Wagner an abolitionist and ardent Republican served as the commander of Camp William Penn. The General Louis Wagner public school in the Oak Lane section of Philadelphia was named to honor him. Asher grew up as a third-generation free black one of few blacks in North Branford Connecticut to receive a formal education as a child. For nine years Asher pastored the Providence congregation. In time he became well-known in black Baptist circles in the North receiving invitations to pastor a number of black congregations. He finally accepted one of the calls that of the Shiloh Baptist Church of Philadelphia. Asher became a prominent Baptist minister in the city of Philadelphia. On December 2 400 people gathered at his church to pray for John Brown at the time of Brown’s scheduled execution. During the Civil War Asher joined the 6th Colored Infantry as chaplain but did survive. Contracting typhoid fever in 1865 at the close of the war while ministering sick soldiers at the regimental hospital in Wilmington Asher died. A historical marker Daniel came North at an early age and was initially a school teacher in Philadelphia before he left his connection with the Methodist church and joined the African Methodist Episcopal church.  In 1852 he was elected AME bishop and his tenure was called the most significant since that of Richard Allen’s the church founder. It was Payne who purchased Wilberforce College in 1863 from white Methodists and made it the first black college in the US.  Payne served as its president. Daniel is recognized for his work that not only improved the education of AME ministry but also expanded the church membership which by the end of Reconstruction had over 250 and an education and civil rights activist Burr was among the African American gentlemen who signed the broadside to recruit United States Colored Troops in Philadelphia William T. Catto and William’s son Octavius. Burr was an organizer in the Underground Railroad working in support of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society.  He was among the people who raised funds for the defense of the Christiana Resistance men who were tried for treason for not obeying the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. He is believed to be the son of Aaron Burr born as product of Aaron Burr’s relationship with Mary Emmons writer and medical doctor. He was also among the earliest black nationalists and was one of the most vocal of voices during the Civil War era. He was a leading in recruiting African American men to join the USCT. He was given the rank of major for a field unit in the U.S. Army by Abraham Lincoln. Delany became the first black man to achieve such rank.

Voted the greatest Briton of all time in a 2002 poll for the BBC Churchill was as famous for his turn of phrase as he was for his political career. It is an almost impossible task to pick out just 12 of his quotes but the team here at Historic UK have had great fun selecting our favourites. We hope you agree! Many of his most famous quotes are from the war years and a recurring theme of his speeches was the need for perseverance.  A lot of these can be applied equally well to our everyday life: Regarding society and his fellow man (or woman) Churchill had a great deal of advice: “All the greatest things are simple and many can be expressed in a single word: freedom; justice; honour; duty; mercy; hope.” “Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference.” “Politics is the ability to foretell what is going to happen tomorrow next month and next year. And to have the ability afterwards to explain why it didn’t happen” the parrots begin to jabber.” he was well known for his love for cigars “All I can say is that I have taken more out of alcohol than alcohol has taken out of me.” “My most brilliant achievement was my ability to be able to persuade my wife to marry me.” “I am fond of pigs. Dogs look up to us. Cats look down on us. Pigs treat us as equals.” We also couldn’t resist including a couple of quotes which may well be apocryphal: but in the morning I will be sober and you will still be ugly.” Lady Astor to Churchill: “If I were married to you I’d put poison in your coffee.” Reply: “If I were married to you as a website celebrating the history of Britain we just had to share this quote: “The farther backward you can look the farther forward you are likely to see.” Copyright © Historic UK Ltd.

They were active in the student protest movement at the University of California at Berkeley in the 1960s where they met and became close friends and collaborators. During the 1970s they became increasingly interested in the issue of labor rights in Central and Eastern Europe and they worked to link democratic and social justice struggles in the Eastern Bloc with social movements in the United States and the Third World. Until Joanne Landy’s death in October 2017 they were co-directors of the Campaign for Peace and Democracy (CPD) which was founded in 1982.

Over time I've grown to like some things about the watch more than than I thought I would.  Other aspects I've listed the top five best and worst things of the Apple Watch below.  I'll start with the worst and save the best for last. The Apple Watch charger is circular contraption the connects magnetically to the back of the watch.  I like the magnetic part but I have no idea why they decided to put in on the back of the watch.  It would be so much easier if the charger connected to the side.  Instead of simply placing the watch on the charger I have to pull both sides of the wristbands taught and meticulously place it on the white circle.  I do this every night in my dark bedroom and it's annoying. The much ballyhooed digital crown (the spinning wheel on the side of the watch) is completely unnecessary.  I sometimes use it to scroll through lists but I can also do that by simply swiping up or down on the watch face.  I occasionally use it to zoom in on the home screen but that would be just as easy using pinch and zoom (if the display supported Multi-Touch like the ).  I press the digital crown button way more often than I use it to scroll and it usually spins a bit while I'm pushing it You can also use the scroll wheel to spin water out of the speaker and fade the home screen on from an off position.  Clearing water from the speaker is kind of a gimmicky and once you fade on the home screen you can't fade it off.  Why?  I don't know.  I expect to see the digital crown removed from future versions of the Apple Watch. is its activity tracking capabilities.  Unfortunately it's also the watch's greatest weakness.  Sometimes the watch counts ""active calories"" while I'm hardly moving and other times when I'm training intensely it barely counts any calories at all.  While the activity recording seems to have gotten somewhat more accurate over the past two months it still doesn't feel accurate or even consistent. I don't like how I have to tell the watch what activity I'm doing in order to get an accurate calorie count.  For example if I play hockey for two hours but forget to start and stop the activity on my watch it may say I've only burned 300 calories.  If I enter ""Hockey"" as the activity the total will be closer to 1 000.  That's a pretty big difference. the heart rate tracking is surprisingly bad during activities like running and working out.  It is pretty accurate if I sit still and test my heart rate but when I'm working out the watch often displays half my actual heart rate.  You would think if the watch knows I'm doing an activity 52 BPM might be a little low. When I say the Apple Watch lacks customization I'm not talking about all the fancy watch cases and bands.  I mean the .  Most of the apps have almost no customization from the Apple Watch interface.  For example I have to use my just to change the number of breaths the Breathe app guides me through each minute. I wish I could customize the delay before the watch face appears when ""Wake Screen on Wrist Raise"" is turned on but that's not an option.  I wish I could push a button to turn off the screen instead of putting my entire hand over the watch face but that's not an option.  I wish I could fade down the display brightness but that's not an option either. I wish I could store more than 250 songs on my Apple Watch (since the Series 2 has 8 GB of total storage).  The Apple Watch is even more locked down than the iPhone when it comes to customization which is a definite drawback for any nerd or power user. My last gripe is with the home screen.  I don't understand this layout. I wish the apps were organized in a grid instead of this circular maze.  Moving an app to another place without messing up the entire layout is more of a game than a simple customization.  Hopefully a grid option that displays the most frequently used apps first will be forthcoming. how can activity tracking be one of the best things about the Apple Watch if it's not even accurate?  Perhaps I'm using a utilitarian argument in that the ends justify the means.  Even though the activity tracking is not highly accurate I use the Apple Watch to record my activity more than any other feature.  The three rings (active calories and standing 12 times per day) – albeit simplistic – have proved to be useful motivators. I've closed all three rings every day so far in March (400 calories and 12 stand hours).  If I'm close to meeting my calories or active minutes goal near the end of the day I add a little exercise to make sure I meet it.  Yes it is pretty depressing when you go through an entire day and don't log 30 minutes of exercise.  But at least the watch makes you aware of it so you can exercise more. I now regularly use the watch to track my workouts and all types of sports.  It's nice to be able to glance at my wrist and see how long I've been working out and (let's just say a rough estimate of) calories burned.  It would be even better if Apple improved the Activity app on the iPhone or developed one for macOS to provide more comparison features to view activity levels over time. The texting capability of the Apple Watch has been the most impressive feature so far.  I've started using my watch more often than my iPhone to check text messages.  The Apple Watch taps me on the wrist and then displays the message only if I move my arm to look at the message.  I can read the message or – most usefully – dictate my response.  The microphone in the Apple Watch is shockingly accurate and almost always catches every word I say. 3. The breathe and stand reminders As I mentioned in my initial the regular ""Breathe"" and ""Stand"" reminders were initially annoyances.  Over the past few weeks they have helped me take renewing breaks during the work day.  I now get up and stand almost every hour during the day instead of every other hour.  I also use the breathe reminders to pause and slow down if I'm in the middle of an intense workflow. One qualifier about the ""Stand"" reminder: it really should be called a ""Move"" reminder since simply standing won't add an hour to your stand goal.  There is no special sensor that detects if you're standing or not.  You really need to move around to get the watch to log an hour to to your stand goal.  Numerous times I have stood up and even walked around in my office without the watch detecting that I was standing.  I guess that just means I need to move around more which might be a good thing anyway. Of course the Apple Watch isn't going to have the battery life of a traditional watch.  It's constantly tracking movement data which is notoriously hard on battery life (it's sending a signal to space after all).  It's also continuously communicating with the iPhone via and receiving push notifications and updates.  Considering all this I find it amazing that the Apple Watch hardly uses 1/4 of a charge in a typical day.  When I put my watch on that annoying charger each night it's almost always between 70% and 80%. Last on my ""Best Of"" list is Apple Pay.  I had been using Apple Pay with my iPhone for about a year before getting the Apple Watch.  While it's cool to pay with your phone it's even cooler to pay with your watch.  It's convenient to go to Whole Foods and pay without ever having to reach in my pocket.  I can also check in at LA Fitness using my watch instead of my phone.  Since my Audi unlocks when I put my hand in the handle and my home door has a keypad I can leave my house and come home without ever reaching in my pocket.  So long first world problems. If you have an Apple Watch I'd be curious to hear what you like or dislike about it.  There are certainly more items I could add to each list but five is enough for now.  Plus I need to go exercise for a few minutes since I haven't closed my exercise ring today. Please enable JavaScript to view the ",[],No,,

If you have bookmarks or links to our site on your blog or website The Trustees of the British Museum (Copyright) c. 3500-3000 BCE. It is considered the most significant among the many cultural contributions of the Sumerians and the greatest among those of the which advanced the writing of cuneiform c. 3200 BCE. The name comes from the Latin word for 'wedge' owing to the wedge-shaped style of writing. In cuneiform a carefully cut writing implement known as a stylus is pressed into soft clay to produce wedge-like impressions that represent word-signs (pictographs) and phonograms or `word-concepts' (closer to a modern-day understanding of a `word'). All of the great Mesopotamian civilizations used cuneiform until it was abandoned in favour of the alphabetic at some point after 100 BCE When the ancient cuneiform tablets of Mesopotamia were discovered and deciphered in the late 19th century CE they would literally transform human understanding of history. Prior to their discovery was considered the oldest and most authoritative book in the world. The brilliant scholar and translator George Smith (l.1840-1876 CE) changed the understanding of history with his translation of in 1872 CE. This translation allowed other cuneiform tablets to be interpreted which overturned the traditional understanding of the biblical version of history and made room for scholarly objective explorations of history to move forward. Jan van der Crabben (CC BY-NC-SA) as the subjects they addressed were more concrete and visible (a king a flood) but developed in complexity as the subject matter became more intangible (the will of the gods the quest for immortality). By 3000 BCE the representations were more simplified and the strokes of the stylus conveyed word-concepts (honour) rather than word-signs (an honourable man). The written language was further refined through the which isolated the phonetic value of a certain sign so as to express grammatical relationships and syntax to determine meaning. In clarifying this the scholar Ira Spar writes: This new way of interpreting signs is called the rebus principle. Only a few examples of its use exist in the earliest stages of cuneiform from between 3200 and 3000 B.C. The consistent use of this type of phonetic writing only becomes apparent after 2600 B.C. It constitutes the beginning of a true writing system characterized by a complex combination of word-signs and phonograms—signs for vowels and syllables—that allowed the scribe to express ideas. By the middle of the Third Millennium B.C. cuneiform primarily written on clay tablets was used for a vast array of economic The great literary works of Mesopotamia such as the famous Epic of Gilgamesh were all written in cuneiform. One no longer had to struggle with the meaning of a pictograph; one now read a word-concept which more clearly conveyed the meaning of the writer. The number of characters used in writing was also reduced from over 1 000 to 600 in order to simplify and clarify the written word. The best example of this is given by the historian in the time of proto-cuneiform: All that had been devised thus far was a technique for noting down things not a writing system. A record of `Two Sheep ' tells us nothing about whether the sheep are being delivered to or anything else about them. (63) Cuneiform developed to the point where it could be made clear whether the sheep were coming or going to the temple and whether they were living or dead. By the time of the priestess-poet who wrote her famous hymns to Inanna in the Sumerian city of cuneiform was sophisticated enough to convey emotional states such as love and adoration as well as the precise reasons behind the writer experiencing such states.

Osama Shukir Muhammed Amin (CC BY-NC-SA) The great literary works of Mesopotamia such as the were all written in cuneiform and were completely unknown until the mid 19th century CE when men like George Smith the Reverend Edward Hincks (l. 1792-1866 CE) Jules Oppert (l. 1825-1905 CE) and Henry Creswicke Rawlinson (l.1810-1895 CE) deciphered the language and translated it into English. Rawlinson's translations of Mesopotamian texts were first presented to the Royal Asiatic Society of London in 1837 CE and again in 1839 CE. In 1846 CE he worked with the archaeologist Austin Henry Layard in his excavation of and was responsible for the earliest translations from the library of discovered at that site. Edward Hincks focused on Persian cuneiform establishing its patterns and identifying vowels among his other contributions. Jules Oppert identified cuneiform's origins and established the grammar of Assyrian cuneiform. George Smith was responsible for deciphering the Mesopotamian version of the Flood Story which until then was thought to be original to the biblical Book of Genesis. Many biblical texts were thought to be original works until cuneiform was deciphered. Many biblical texts were thought to be original until cuneiform was deciphered. The Fall of Man and the Great Flood were understood as literal events in human history dictated by God to the author (or authors) of Genesis but were now recognized as Mesopotamian myths which Hebrew scribes had embellished on in . The biblical story of the could now be understood as a myth derived from and other Mesopotamian works. The Book of Job far from being an actual historical account of an individual's unjust suffering could now be recognized as a literary piece belonging to a Mesopotamian tradition following the discovery of the earlier text which relates a similar story. The concept of a dying and reviving god who goes down into the underworld and then returns presented as a novel concept in was now understood as an ancient paradigm first expressed in Mesopotamian literature in the poem . The very model of many of the narratives of the Bible could now be read in light of the discovery of which took a figure from history and embellished upon his achievements in order to relay an important moral and cultural message. Flood Tablet of the Epic of Gilgamesh Osama Shukir Muhammed Amin (CC BY-NC-SA) the Bible was considered the oldest book in the world was thought to be the oldest love poem; but all of that changed with the discovery and decipherment of cuneiform. The oldest love poem in the world is now recognized as long before The Song of Solomon was written. These advances in understanding were all made by the 19th century CE archaeologists and scholars sent to Mesopotamia to substantiate biblical stories through physical evidence. Along with other Assyriologists (among them T. G. Pinches and Edwin Norris) Rawlinson spearheaded the development of Mesopotamian language studies along with his other works became the standard reference on the subject following their publication in the 1860's CE and remain respected scholarly works into the modern day. regarded as an intellect of the first rank died on a field expedition to Nineveh in 1876 CE at the age of 36. Smith a self-taught translator of cuneiform made his first contributions to deciphering the ancient writing in his early twenties at such a young age has long been regarded a significant loss to the advancement in translations of cuneiform in the 19th century CE. The literature of Mesopotamia informed all the written works which came after. Mesopotamian motifs can be detected in the works of works and still resonate in the present day through the biblical narratives which they inform. When George Smith deciphered cuneiform he dramatically changed the way human beings would understand their history. The accepted version of the creation of the world and many of the other precepts by which people had been living their lives were all challenged by the revelation of Mesopotamian - largely Sumerian - literature.

twi- (Old English) and glyph that represents the number. It is the natural number a number that is used for counting. it is classified as a real number The number two also represents a pair or sexual reproduction requires the mating of two or the uniting of materials provided by male and female organisms. Eastern philosophy points to such dual characteristics as masculinity and femininity (in the animate world) or positivity and negativity (in the inanimate world) (in Chinese). Although some consider good and as an example of Yang-Yin characteristics there is a fundamental difference: evil (such as hatred and violence) flourishes by destroying goodness (such as love and kindness) whereas male and female flourish and multiply their kind by uniting in harmony and love. The glyph currently used in the Western world to represent the number 2 traces its roots back to the Brahmin Indians who wrote 2 as two horizontal lines. (It is still written that way in modern Chinese and Japanese.) The Gupta script rotated the two lines 45 degrees and sometimes also made the top line shorter and made its bottom end curve towards the center of the bottom line. Apparently for speed the Nagari started making the top line more like a curve and connecting to the bottom line. The Ghubar Arabs made the bottom line completely vertical and now the glyph looked like a dotless closing question mark. Restoring the bottom line to its original horizontal position but keeping the top line as a curve that connects to the bottom line leads to our modern glyph. 2 usually has the same height as a lowercase X Two has many properties in mathematics. if it is divisible by 2. For integers written in a numeral system based on an even number divisibility by 2 is easily tested by merely looking at the one's place digit. If it is even then the whole number is even. In particular when written in the decimal system all multiples of 2 will end in 0 Two is the smallest and first prime number and the only even one. (For this reason it is sometimes humorously called ""the oddest prime"".) The next prime number is . Two and three are the only two consecutive prime numbers. 2 is the first Sophie Germain prime and the first Smarandache-Wellin prime. It is an Eisenstein prime with no imaginary part and real part of the form . It is also a Stern prime appearing in infinitely many solutions to the Markov Diophantine equation involving odd-indexed Pell numbers. It is the third Fibonacci number and the third and fifth Perrin numbers. two is also a highly composite number because it has more divisors than the number one. The next highly composite number is Vulgar fractions with 2 or 5 in the denominator do not yield infinite decimal expansions as is the case with most primes because 2 and 5 are factors of Two is the base of the simplest numeral system in which natural numbers can be written concisely being the length of the number a logarithm of the value of the number (whereas in base 1 the length of the number is the value of the number itself); the binary system is used in Two also has the unique property that 2+2 = 2•2 = 2²= no matter how high the operation is. Two is the only number x such that the sum of the reciprocals of the powers of x equals itself. In symbols: {\displaystyle \sum _{k=0}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{2^{k}}}=1+{\frac {1}{2}}+{\frac {1}{4}}+{\frac {1}{8}}+{\frac {1}{16}}+\cdots =2.} This comes from the fact that: {\displaystyle \sum _{k=0}^{\infty }{\frac {1}{n^{k}}}=1+{\frac {1}{n-1}}\quad {\mbox{for all}}\quad n\in \mathbb {R} >1.} Powers of two are central to the concept of Mersenne primes . Two is the first Mersenne prime exponent. Taking the square root of a number is such a common mathematical operation that the spot on the root sign where the exponent would normally be written for cubic roots and other such roots is left blank for square roots as it is considered tacit. The square root of two was the first known irrational number. The smallest field has two elements. In the set-theoretical construction of the natural numbers 2 is identified with the set . This latter set is important in category theory: it is a subobject classifier in the category of sets. as well as its own factorial. Two often occurs in numerical sequences such as the Fibonacci number sequence but not quite as often as one does. Two is also a Motzkin number and an open meandric number. Two is the number of n-Queens Problem solutions for n = 4. With one exception all known solutions to Znám's problem start with 2. Two also has the unique property such that: Two has a connection to triangular numbers: {\displaystyle tri_{d}(n)={\frac {1}{d!}}\prod _{k=0}^{d-1}(n+k)\quad {\mbox{if}}\quad d\geq 2} gives the nth d-dimensional simplex number. When d=2 The number of domino tilings of a 2×2 checkerboard is 2. which commonly have a valence of +2. Also in the periodic table consists of the eight elements In the structures of many living various features occur in pairs. Examples include: Sexual reproduction requires the mating of two organisms or the uniting of materials provided by male and female organisms. Studies in molecular biology have shown that each usually consists of two polynucleotide strands that form a double helix. There are two opposite and complementary electrical charges: positive and negative. Both are needed and work together in the formation of There are two opposite and complementary magnetic poles: north and south. Both play a part in setting up a magnetic field. In the electronic configuration of an atom (of opposite spin) may occupy a given orbital at any instant. 2 is the first magic number. A magic number (in this case) is the number of nucleons ( such that they are arranged into complete shells in the nucleus. is a stellar system consisting of two The Roman numeral II is usually applied to the second-discovered satellite of a planet or minor planet (such as Pluto II or (87) Sylvia II Remus). The Roman numeral II also stands for bright giant in the Yerkes spectral classification scheme. Two is the Saros number of the series that began on May 4 The duration of Saros series 2 was 1298.17 years and it contained 73 solar eclipses. Two is the Saros number of the series that began on March 3 The duration of Saros series 2 was 1298.17 years and it contained 73 lunar eclipses. 2 is the resin identification code used in recycling to identify high-density polyethylene. International maritime signal flag for 2 or Yang and Eum (in Korean). They stand for pairs of characteristics such as masculinity and femininity or positivity and negativity. Some consider good and as an example of Yang-Yin characteristics but there is a fundamental difference: evil (such as hatred and violence) flourishes by destroying goodness (such as love and kindness) whereas male and female flourish by uniting in harmony. a pair known as ""thesis"" and ""antithesis"" have to clash with each other for progress to occur. This philosophy became a justification for class warfare in which the ""lower class"" were encouraged to destroy the ""upper class.""

1620765360.553328,34258863,https://pc.net/news/2017-03-11/apple_watch_nike_review,"I never wanted an Apple Watch.  I made that pretty clear .  But my Garmin Forerunner 405CX recently died and I needed a replacement.  So I decided to try the Apple Watch.  I bought the Nike version just after the beginning of the year and I've been using it for about two months. It's a good thing I waited to review the watch until after two months of owning it.  My view of the watch has changed a lot since the first week or so.  Let me explain. I bought the Apple Watch to replace my Garmin Forerunner not to use as a daily watch.  The Apple Watch Series 2 (which the Nike+ version is based on) is the first model to include so this was the first time I even considered an Apple Watch.  Since I'm already so deep into the Apple ecosystem the way the Apple Watch synced with my made it worth the premium compared to running watches even if I just used it for running.  The $400 price for the 42mm model wasn't much different than the $330 Garmin Forerunner 235.  Apple haters and trolls your comments are welcome below. I decided to wear it for a week to test out all the non-running features.  After all I am still kind of a geek and I wanted to see what the thing could do.  My plan was to put it back on the shelf after a week and then just use it for running.  Two months later I'm still wearing the watch.  It's become a daily accessory.  But that didn't happen without a few notable frustrations. My first week with the Apple Watch was pretty rough.  I didn't like wearing it (since I don't usually wear a watch) and I didn't really have a use for it.  It seemed the activity tracking features were super inaccurate and the ""stand"" and ""breathe"" reminders were annoying.  My first run was not recorded in my Nike Run account because I used the Activity app instead of the Nike app to start my run.  The one thing I bought the watch for didn't work.  I almost returned it. Eventually I learned how the Apple Watch only measures active calories and also how important it is to specify your activity before starting it.  The ""stand"" and ""breathe"" reminders went from being annoying disruptions to being welcome pauses in my workday.  The indoor run tracking became more accurate after a few outdoor runs.  I started using the watch to read and reply to texts and checkout at stores using Apple Pay. Tracks runs like a GPS running watch Makes it easy to read and respond to texts I now wear my Apple Watch every day.  It's not indispensable like my iPhone (I don't turn my car around if I forget to put it on) but I do feel a little incomplete when I'm not wearing it. While the watch has turned out to be more useful than I expected it is still far from perfect.  Stay tuned for an upcoming article on the best and worst aspects of the Apple Watch.

Authors such as Stathis Kouvelakis have used it to analyse the movement of the in France. An organic crisis involves a breakdown of the ability of the ruling class to “maintain its leading role”. One of its “most visible symptoms” is the “collapse of support for traditional parties”. The discredit attained by the dominant parties by the “politicians” and even “politics” itself but viscerally despised by many people recalls the concept of “organic crisis” advanced by the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci. Authors such as Stathis Kouvelakis have used it to analyse the movement of the in France. An organic crisis involves a breakdown of the ability of the ruling class to “maintain its leading role”. One of its “most visible symptoms” is the “collapse of support for traditional parties”. This crisis is distinguished from a situation of radical change by the absence of a social force capable of replacing the order in crisis. It is an unstable full of opportunities and dangers. The ruling class tries to regain its ability to lead. For this it has large reserves. Thus the organic crisis “unleashes a recomposition of political personnel” including the struggle between leaders and parties and the emergence of new ones constitutional reforms and so on. Since the resignation of Rosselló (Puerto Rico’s governor until August 2 2019) the slogan has been to return to “normality”. But that is not achieved by decree as evidenced by the episode of Pierluisi and the internal struggle of the PNP around the governorate. The ruling class wants stability but does not agree on how to achieve it. Everyone from Rivera Schatz to the from the leadership of the PPD to the radio commentators from the Chamber of Commerce to the employers’ offices has different ideas on how to achieve it. Each tries to bring the charcoal to their sardine. Given this process it is useful to review some ideas. Puerto Rico does not live under a “partyocracy” as is sometimes said. It is not dominated by parties. It is dominated by those who dominate through the parties. To put it bluntly: it is dominated by plutocracy. The owners of money wealth and capital. The employer class. The rich. Give it whatever name you want. But this ruling class is not homogeneous nor does it act as a unit. It does not meet somewhere and decide what its policy will be. It depends on structures that allow it to elaborate positions: its press Chamber of Commerce and so on) and its parties (the PPD and the PNP). The relationship between this class and its parties is not simple. Under an elected government they are subject to different pressures. Elected officials are supposed to serve the ruling class and gain and maintain the support of the electors on the other. Otherwise they would be of little use to the ruling class. But that electoral support is not achieved with beautiful smiles and phrases only. It often requires making real concessions to people or not giving way to the most voracious employers’ demands. This was the case with Law 80 which the employer class wanted to eliminate something that some of its politicians considered would have an unacceptable electoral effect. The employer class has always had this problem with its elected representatives: the latter are more subject to electoral pressure and therefore do not implement the entire anti-worker agenda of the former. Hence also the sympathy of the employer class for the Board: by not being elected nor having to worry about re-election the Board would dare to act without fear where the “politicians” falter (Law 80 is also an example of this). The employer class also loves to criticize the “politicians” presenting themselves as part of the people outraged by corruption and so on even though that is the other side of corruption: a “politician” can only sell themselves if there is someone to buy them. Thus we have a double hypocrisy inherent in our employer democracy: employers’ politicians despise the people but they have to present themselves as friends and servants of the people (which sometimes implies real conflicts with the employers they represent) and the employers sometimes distance themselves from corrupt politicians who remain at their service. The publication of the “chat” altered the operation of this machine. It exposed the first hypocrisy: the contempt of politicians for the people was exposed. But the “chat” was the trigger not the cause of the summer of 2019. An “organic crisis” is not forged in three days: it was prepared for a little over a decade. Since 2006 our economy has been sinking into an increasingly serious crisis. 250 000 jobs have been lost. Hundreds of thousands have had to emigrate. Young people find no future in their country. Faced with this depression the government first became indebted imposing new sacrifices (the Sales and Use Tax in 2006). When the debt became part of the crisis it imposed austerity measures to try to pay it off: law 7 increases in the Sales and Use Tax. Meanwhile The discrediting of traditional parties was already reflected in 2016 with the victory of Rosselló with 42% of the votes. Then the Board came to impose increasingly severe austerity measures. On top of this reality came the blow of Hurricane Maria: more than 4 $90 billion in losses. The response of the colonial and imperial governments was inept and corrupt (remember Trump throwing paper towels and the Whitefish contract). Frustration with all this broke out in July 2019. The crisis will be long precisely because our ruling class has no project. They love to blame the government but they haven’t articulated a coherent plan to get us out of depression. As a candidate for the governorship I proposed to their organizations to recover profits that are now fleeing to reinvest them here: they were the first to reject these measures which would benefit them. They prefer to be harmed rather than touching the privileges of external capital. They are a dependent bourgeoisie with no vision of the country or the future. But they will continue to rule until we build our alternative. Their goal now is normalization. Several strategies will be used: the crisis will be attributed to Rosselló’s excesses. Once that is resolved things must return to normal. They thought Pierluisi was the man to achieve this. For two days GFR Media sold him as the man of stability. But the crisis was too serious. With the manoeuvre being repudiated by the Supreme Court they detached themselves from Pierluisi and attributed everything to his mistakes. Now a more insidious manoeuvre will come: we will be asked what was the use of the struggle everything remains the same? That is they will try to turn the limits of victory into an argument against struggle. We cannot allow it. While those above try to rebuild their domain we have to build our alternative. The perspective cannot be to make a new constitution for the colonial regime but to unleash decolonization accompanied by the fight against the Board and bipartisanship. That means remaining on the streets and also preparing for the polls: we took down Rosselló in 2019 let’s finish cleaning the house in 2020. ] Pedro Pierluisi was sworn in as Rosselló’s successor but Puerto Rico’s senate and Supreme Court rejected this as illegitimate and he was forced to resign. ] Governor Rosselló was forced to resign after the leaking of hundreds of derisive and offensive private chat messages between him and members of his inner circle.

1620765375.776829,82876044,https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/2006_Kolkata_leather_factory_fire,"refers to a deadly industrial fire that occurred in West Bengal 2006. A lightning rod for criticism of poor safety standards among the country's "" "" the fire broke out in a leather bag in the South 24 Paragana district of The industrial fire claimed the lives of at least ten people unable to escape because the factory's doors had been illegally locked. Authorities in response to local residents' angry criticism admitted that the substandard emergency response to the accident. The fire underwent two separate investigations. One inquiry focused on the cause of the fire while the other sought to determine criminal responsibility for the disaster as well as the operation of the illegal factory. in 1947. The development of Indian clean technology has been remarkable. Thomas Friedman's best selling book The Lexus and the Olive Tree shone light on India's rapid transition from a third world underdeveloped country of nearly 1 billion people a rapidly developing nation among the power players of the twenty-first century. The Kolkata Leather Factory Fire of 2006 reminded Indians that India has many more steps to take. Steps have been taken on the national level in India to avoid the violation of the law by the city government and factory owners. The right to work in safe conditions is a basic right. Initial investigations alleged that the leather bag factory site had been illegally operated factory. The factory had been located on the third floor of a four-story building Investigators initially determined that the first and second floors of the structure housed additional illegal factories. Tenex Exports owned and operated the factory destroyed in the fire. all of the people killed or injured in the fire slept in the factory at night a normal situation in India. As noted earlier the building had been located in the Tannix International in the South 24 Paragana district of The building had just one emergency exit. Forty workers had been housed in the structure at the time of the fire. The fire broke out in the factory at around 2:30 IST as workers slept nearby. Once they became aware of the blaze the desperate workers found the factory's locked doors. Five fire tenders arrived on the scene of the fire. local residents had broken down two locked gates and rescued the workers. Rescue efforts had been delayed when an individual carrying keys to open the door nervously dropped them while attempting to open the gate. Ten people died by the time rescuers reached the factory's interior with a further eighteen seriously injured. Emergency medical teams transported the injured workers many suffering from burns over 70 percent of their bodies to the National Medical College and Hospital. Faced with a shortage of beds the hospital placed the victims on the floor. Lacking an intensive burn care unit the doctors had only ointments and saline drips available at the hospital to treat them. Arrangements made the patients eventually moved to other hospitals. Local MLA Javed Khan later incorrectly reported the death toll at least twelve. The Rapid Action Force also deployed to maintain calm. People living in the vicinity of the illegal factory said that the number of deaths might have been reduced had the fire service responded promptly. They claimed that the fire brigade failed to send personnel or equipment to the scene until more than an hour after the brigade first received word of the fire. Residents also claimed the fire service dispatched only after the arrived and requested fire service backup. some on the scene reported an inadequate number of ambulances. admitted to that lapse the following morning. Complaints extended beyond the fire brigade's late response. Local people also complained that the victims should never have been taken to the Calcutta National Medical College. Rather they should have been transported directly to hospitals with intensive burn units The mayor immediately launched an investigation to determine the cause of the fire as well as the reason the building had been locked from the outside. the KMC inspected the building. Although the investigators established no actual cause of the fire they noted that large quantities of inflammable materials had been stored inside the building. a separate criminal investigation focused on the illegal factory itself. Almost all factories and homes in the area lack proper legal approval and authorization and fail to follow building codes and sanctions. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said action would be taken against the owners of the factory and house and Superintendent of Police of South 24 Parganas S.N. Gupta said that the owners of the building would be arrested. Investigation has shown that the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) issued notices to the building on three separate occasions it took no further action. The KMC approved trade licenses for two businesses to operate from the building. has had a police complaint filed against him by the fire department for illegal construction charges. Mohammed Sagir Ahmed and Mohammed Asif the owners of Tenex Exports also face related charges. Both investigations are ongoing.

It protects your personal information from being intercepted by someone on your network running a packet sniffing program or other malicious software.  For PC.net this isn't really a concern. So why the switch?  Well Google guidelines for websites around the world has encouraged websites to use HTTPS since August 6 is to make the web more secure preventing data theft and the alteration of webpage content between the server and end user.  A noble goal but also a pretty big hassle for the average webmaster.  Historically moving to HTTPS has involved buying a authenticating your identity as an individual or organization and installing the certificate for your on the server.  Not an easy task for the everyday webmaster. those of us managing our websites with cPanel a common website management system for now have an easy way to secure our websites.

These groups exhibit a number of dysfunctional characteristics to include group narcissism and shadow projection The Seeds of Revolution Have Sprouted: What is Now to be Done? Turning points in history are very rare. We are now living in the midst of one with the two months of virtually continuous protests against police abuse and for a human society that have swept the U.S. as well other parts of the world since the police murder of George Floyd on May 25. Why Leftists In Most States Should Vote Green And Why In Some States We Shouldn't My late comrade and esteemed New Politics editorial board member Joanne Landy steadfastly insisted she’d never vote for a Democratic Party candidate preferring a protest vote for the Green Party. “But I’ll never join that party Trump understands that to be an effective boss requires not only authority but respect for authority and to instill such respect it is necessary to speak to working people in an obsequious and patronizing way to make it easier for them to accept the reality of what is required by the law of profit. Imagining a Socialist Presidential Candidate Winning the African American Vote If the activists that Bernie Sanders inspired are to continue to consider winning the presidency as a pivotal condition for transforming democratic power and the state that achievement entails winning the African American vote in the Democratic primary. Herman Benson (1915-2020): No Socialism Without Democracy veteran socialist activist and fighter for rank-and-file democracy in the labour movement aged 104. Herman was the second-to-last survivor at least to my knowledge of the “first generation” of “third camp” socialists. Austerity’s Future: Higher Education and COVID-19 The process of neoliberal reforms has been well-established long before COVID-19 hit the nation. The global pandemic has only further entrenched this model and countless thousands of staff in smaller colleges throughout the U.S. will now suffer its ramifications. Gramsci in Lebanon: Analyzing the Powerful(‘s) Ideology we are faced with a dangerous phenomenon: the dominance of ruling-class ideology. Not only has capitalism created long-lasting social and economic implications for people but it has also become “culturally hegemonic.” Adjudicating the Chomsky-Greenwald Dispute on Lesser-Evil Voting so we leftists have a sworn duty to reignite the debate about “lesser-evil voting.” In accord with my self-identification as #1 Fan of the Great Man I want to defend the Chomskyan point of view. Punched in the Face: Minneapolis Labor and the Fight for #JusticeforGeorgeFloyd While much of the labor movement in Minneapolis has embedded itself in the city’s struggle against police brutality union leadership at the national level has shied away from demands that it clean house. Belgium’s Colonial Crimes in the Congo: A Duty to Remember Thanks to the Black Lives Matter mobilizations against racism in general and racism against black people in particular becoming an international phenomenon more and more people are seeking to know the truth about the dark past of the colonial powers and the continuation of neo-colonialism up to the present times. A Global Black Call to Action We are the children of uprisings a generation standing on the shoulders of those that came before us and a people united to usher in a new world. We call on our siblings across the world to join us on June 19th. Are We Also Ready to Confront the Wages of Complicity? As this movement against systemic anti-blackness continues to take shape it’s really important that we call out this “system” by its name–racial capitalism which has always functioned through racial domination and class hierarchies From Passionate Uprising to Sustained Rebellion The passionate uprising that began in Minneapolis after police murdered George Floyd quickly spread across the country and around the world is now the biggest upheaval since 1968. Notes on the Black Lives Matter Uprising in Historical and Global Context The Black Lives Matter uprising in the USA the working-class resistance to unsafe conditions in Italy and the fight by Hong Kong youth against the repressive Chinese regime exemplify a new generation on the move for radical change. Why Affluent Indians Speak Up about Race but stay Silent about Caste The fact that average upper-caste Indians speak up about racism but not about caste shows their duplicity hypocrisy and armchair activism for believing in a concept that should be discarded. Stop Police Violence against Anti-Racist Protesters! This violence is an extension of the police violence that took the life of George Floyd and the state violence visited on Black and other people of color on this continent over the last five hundred years. We Don’t Need Cops To Take A Knee We Need Them To Take Off Their Badges…For Good Social media streams are currently overrun with images and videos of mace and rubber bullets being savagely deployed against unarmed citizens. Democracy and Development: Capitalist Crises and Covid-19 For the past four months Covid-19 has revealed the contradictions and unsustainability of global capitalism perhaps in a manner that no other single phenomenon has ever done in history. Socialists Must Fight to Defund the Police The murder of George Floyd by police has sparked protest and outrage across the country. Emma Caterine writes on how socialists can connect the movement against racist police violence to a broad socialist program through the struggle to defund the police.

Some are places where Catto lived worked and walked the streets. Others are places that are commemorative of both men. This section provides a window into locations past and present specific to Catto. Where possible historical images at or near Catto’s time are used to illustrate location. This provides an opportunity for this resource to be used the navigate the Philadelphia region and compare the past to the present. In addition the Lessons Plans and Resource section of the web portal expands out locations to Martin Luther King and can help one to explore teach and learn about the intersection of the two civil rights narratives linking the 19th Century to the 20th Century. The presentations here reflect the collaborative work of Amy Cohen Education Director at History Making Productions and her students in a Temple University social studies methods class with the Catto Education Initiative. Their participation is noted in narratives at the locations they worked on. Selected educational activities created from their work are incorporated throughout the Catto education portal but specifically in Lesson Plans and Resources. The inventory here also includes several schools that are connected to the Catto story either because he attended them they were named for him or names for significant individuals in the Catto historical narrative. We’ve included these because schools are important public monuments and can be a way to engage students and the public with civic issues.

1620765424.39309,93670844,https://pc.net/news/2016-11-23/2017_health_insurance_premium_increase,"Why my Health Insurance Premiums are Increasing 56% Next Year My health insurance premiums are going up over 56% next year.  It is the biggest annual increase in monthly premiums I have ever had – by far. I surmised how Obamacare may have been a in the U.S. election.  The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has driven up health care costs and has actually made health care much affordable for most US citizens.  It certainly has not benefitted me the past few years.  See the chart of my 2005 to 2017 insurance premiums below. The chart above speaks for itself.  As the details of the Affordable Care Act have been implemented over past few years I have watched my health insurance premiums skyrocket.  On top of that my insurance company – Medica – has reduced my coverage lowered the amount they will pay for prescription drugs I will be paying 455% or 5.5x more each month for my health insurance premium than I was paying in 2005.  I realize I have gotten older and I understand that higher age means higher premiums.  But a 455% increase is absurd. So what is causing these runaway price increases?  There are dozens of factors but two of them stand out: 1) supply and demand I believe the people who created and supported the Affordable Care Act had good intentions but unfortunately they were not economically astute.  The ACA added a number of costs to the health care system without taking into account supply and demand.  There are a relatively fixed number of hospitals and other health care employees.  So when you increase the number of people who have full access to medical providers and personnel but demand increases. The result?  Prices increase. Health care costs increase across the board and doctors can all charge more.  And some of them need to charge more.  The requirements placed on hospitals and doctors require them to spend more money.  So they increase their prices to cover the costs.  Insurance companies then have to pay more for medical services.  And how do they cover their costs?  Increase premiums. insurance companies could combat increasing prices by running their businesses more efficiently.  But they don't need to.  The lack of competition in the health insurance industry is mysteriously absent especially in a capitalist country like the United States.  Health insurance companies have near monopolies in their own states and therefore do not have many competitors to force them to keep their costs down.  So how do they increase their profits without reducing costs?  Increase premiums. Medica is one of the most inefficient companies I have ever seen.  For example I request that they sign me up for paperless statements – something that would save them money and be more convenient for me.  But they have never done it.  They refuse to update their system.  In fact I had to fax my request to them and they mailed me their response.  Even in 2016 I'm not the only one who has experienced the inefficiency of Medica firsthand.  Nearly every health care provider I have visited in the past few years is constantly frustrated with Medica.  They lose paperwork don't call back when they say they will and take months to process some claims.  The number of internal problems would cause nearly any other corporation to go out of business.  But Medica has a not-so-secret way of combating their inefficiency.  Increase premiums. A prime example of Medica's horrible management is a program they launched a few years ago called ""Healthy Savings."" I first found out about this program in a letter Medica sent me around the time Obamacare was enacted.  The letter said Medica would no longer be providing me with a $20 monthly discount for my gym membership.  It said I could save even more money with their new Healthy Savings program which would give me discounts for making healthy shopping decisions. That sounded OK since I make a point to buy healthy food – lots of fruits and vegetables and food without preservatives.  I typically more for these types of foods compared to the cheaper less healthy options available.  My grocery bills are typically in the range of $100 to $150 but I have never saved more than $2.50 using my Healthy Savings card.  Most of the time the cashier scans my card and I save $0.00.  The Healthy Savings program has definitely has not made up for the $240 each year I am no longer reimbursed for my fitness center attendance.  In fact I don't think I've saved more than $20 total in the past five years. The amount of money Medica has wasted by setting up this program would have caused most companies to go bankrupt.  But it's not too hard to figure out their method of subsidizing such a massive failure.  Increase premiums. Most of this article was specific to the organizational disaster that is Medica.  But Medica is a microcosm of a much larger problem – the health insurance industry.  The lack of competition in the marketplace means there are several other insurance behemoths across the country raising premiums to keep their profits intact.  The Affordable Health Care act needed to address this problem if it really was going to make health care more affordable. Until the waste is cleaned out of the system and competition is introduced into the marketplace insurance companies will continue to do the one thing they are good at.  Increase premiums.

It is the natural number a number that is used for counting. it is classified as a real number The number three was once written with as many lines as the number represents. The Romans tired of writing 4 as IIII but 3 continues to be written as three lines in Roman and Chinese numerals. This was the way the and the Gupta made the three lines more curved. The Nagari started rotating the lines clockwise ending each line with a slight downward stroke on the right. Eventually they made these strokes connect with the lines below transforming it to a character that looks very much like a modern 3 with an extra stroke at the bottom. finally eliminated the extra stroke and created our modern 3. The extra stroke was very important to the Eastern Arabs who made it much larger while rotating the strokes above to lie along a horizontal axis. To this day Eastern Arabs write a 3 that looks like a mirrored 7 with ridges on its top line: While the shape of the 3 character has an ascender in most modern typefaces in typefaces with text figures the character usually has a descender it has an ascender instead of a descender. A common variant of the digit 3 has a flat top sometimes used to prevent people from falsifying a 3 into an 8. Three is the first odd prime number and the second smallest prime. It is both the first Fermat prime (2 + 1) and the first Mersenne prime (2² - 1) as well as the first lucky prime. However it's the second Sophie Germain prime the second Mersenne prime exponent the second factorial prime (2! + 1) Three is the first unique prime based on the properties of its reciprocal. Three is the third Heegner number. Three is the second triangular number and it is the only prime triangular number. Three is the only prime which is one less than a perfect square. Any other number which is n² - 1 for some integer n is not prime since it is (n - 1)(n + 1). This is true for 3 as well but in its case one of the factors is 1. Three non-collinear points determine a plane and a Three is the fourth Fibonacci number and the third that is unique. In the Perrin sequence 3 is both the zeroth and third Perrin numbers. Vulgar fractions with 3 in the denominator have a single digit repeating sequences in their A natural number is divisible by three if the sum of its digits in base 10 is divisible by 3. For example the number 21 is divisible by three (3 times 7) and the sum of its digits is 2 + 1 = 3. Because of this the reverse of any number that is divisible by three (or indeed any permutation of its digits) is also divisible by three. For instance 1368 and its reverse 8631 are both divisible by three (and so are 1386 is the most durable shape possible the only ""perfect"" figure that if all endpoints have hinges will never change its shape unless the sides themselves are bent. 3 is the only integer between the mathematical constants Three of the five regular polyhedra have triangular faces—the tetrahedron three of the five regular polyhedra have vertices where three faces meet—the tetrahedron only three different types of polygons comprise the faces of the five regular polyhedra—the There are only three distinct 4×4 panmagic squares. Only three tetrahedral numbers are also perfect squares. It is frequently noted by historians of numbers that early counting systems often relied on the three-patterned concept of ""One- Two- Many"" to describe counting limits. In other words in their own language equivalent way early peoples had a word to describe the quantities of one and two but any quantity beyond this point was simply denoted as ""Many."" As an extension to this insight it can also be noted that early counting systems appear to have had limits at the numerals 2 and 4. References to counting limits beyond these three indices do not appear to prevail as consistently

Nature defines the state of supersymmetry as ±0 (left- and right-handed). This allows additional variations with respect to the breaking of supersymmetry involving the number three. The whole spectrum of possibilities based on the number three thus is duplicated for matter and antimatter. Three is realized as 0 1 2 in the number of exponents defining the basic kinds of spin. These are ½*2^0 ħ (fermionic) ½*2^2 ħ (gravitational). The bosonic state is the symmetric state. appearing as changes of flavor can be by only three multiples of a fundamental angular quantum of spin causing an 1/3 elementary charge e. The down quark only can change its spin from -1 to +2 the up-quark. A supersymmetric superstring can break supersymmetry from -0 to -3 (electron) or from +0 to +3 (positron). The electron anti-neutrino (+3) and electron neutrino (-3)represent three quanta of fermionic spin within the spacetime metric (no superstrings/particles) Three non-gravitational forces actively are generated by three different superstring spin functionalities while gravity is a passive reaction of spacetime due to the presence of superstrings with broken supersymmetry. Three represents an optimum of economy in a physical geometrical realization and a maximum of functionality at the same time. This limits the otherwise nearly infinite number of degrees of freedom by a defined geometry with a specific functionality to exactly the ones needed to generate the fundamental basis for the expression of the ""Everything."" The number three is shown to be represented by different possible spin states in the regime from -3 to +3 that is by negative and positive integer numbers including a -0 and +0 in contrast to mathematics where 0 is an integer number without sign. Due to geometrically defined quanta of spin the superstring shows a physical realization of integer numbers between -3 and +3. This answers Roger Penrose's question of the physical meaning of integer numbers (Road to Reality p. 65) and their relevance in the physical world. Three different states of string tension exist. The whole geometry and functionality is the same with exception of the orthogonal magnetic flux component causing gravo-magnetic mass. Thus three generations of particles can exist solely according to energetic conditions. The basic relevance of the number three for the superstring in no way is touched. Three is the smallest number that on breaking of symmetry allows the emergence of two additional functionalities different from the one of a central state. These either can be symmetric as in -3 (±0) +3 (electron and the positron) or asymmetric as in -1 (-0) +2 (quarks) or -2 (+0) +1 (anti quarks). This means breaking of a symmetry also can result in one of two different asymmetric states. In this case supersymmetry globally is conserved on the average by the properties of three quarks (enforced quark confinement). Multiplication of these angular spins by 1/3 gives the three particle charges negative or positive are defined by the direction of angular spin.

1620765459.432736,153902,https://pc.net/news/2016-11-09/2016_us_election_obamacare,"Obamacare: The Untold Story of the 2016 Election It actually happened.  Donald Trump has been elected Not too many saw this coming including myself.  Millions of people in America and around the world were glued to their TVs Nearly every political analyst predicted a Hillary Clinton victory.  Many of them were confident the election wouldn't even be close.  But it was close.  And Trump won.  The smartest people in news got it wrong. So why did Donald Trump win?  Was it because Americans are frustrated with the establishment (the current government)?  Do they not trust Hillary?  Or do US citizens simply want a leader who is not politically correct?  These are all reasons people voted for Trump but they had already been factored into the polls.  So what made the difference?  I have a theory — and it revolves around one word: Obamacare. In the weeks preceding the election millions of people in the United States saw their health insurance premiums skyrocket.  Many people received letters from our insurance companies saying our 2017 premiums are going to increase over 50% from 2016.  Combined with double digit increases over the past several years US residents are being forced to pay monthly premiums that have more than doubled since the Affordable Health Care Act — also known as Obamacare — was passed.  Plus deductibles have gone up and health plans cover less expenses.  Most Americans are spending thousands of dollars more per year for less health coverage than they had before the bill was passed.  The name ""Affordable Health Care Act"" is insulting. Americans are well aware that Democrats are responsible for Obamacare (the name kind of gives it away).  It has been one of the most poorly implemented plans ever instituted by the United States government.  While the intentions of the bill's authors may have been noble they forgot to pay attention to one very important economic principle — supply and demand.  Healthcare costs were already running out of control and the Affordable Health Care Act did nothing to address the financial problems.  Instead it exacerbated them. I think Obamacare is the untold story of the 2016 election.  People who are outraged with their healthcare expenses may have given Trump the votes he needed to win.

James and Correspondence (New Politics Vol. XVI No. 1 newsletter that was published in Detroit from 1959 to 1967. I participated in all aspects of the publication from writing and drawing cartoons to traveling the country on behalf of our newsletter. discussed the labor movement and politics and some issues were devoted to the Black visual arts in Detroit as well as to publishing Black poetry. I went to New York City and the struggle in Harlem; to Prince Edward County where the public schools had been closed; to the struggle of Blacks with guns in Monroe North Carolina; and to the civil rights movement of Martin Luther King in Atlanta; as well as to Africa and the Caribbean. I also drew political cartoons for the newsletter. By 1963 I had become the managing editor. I wrote articles about developments in Detroit in the auto plants and on the streets about Drum—the Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement—and the teachers strike. Detroit was at the center of the urban upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s and C.L.R. James and Martin Glaberman had established the Correspondence Publishing Company in 1951 after they left the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party. But then C.L.R. had been expelled from the United States in 1953 and I did not meet him until the mid-1960s when he went to Canada for a Black writers conference. I met him again in the 1970s when he was again permitted to enter into the United States. He was offered a position at Federal City College—now the University of the District of Columbia—in Washington D.C. These meetings gave me some appreciation of the giant intellect and the broad historical knowledge of the man. We talked only briefly about Most of my knowledge of the history of except what I learned from C.L.R. himself came from conversations with Glaberman with James and Grace Lee Boggs and later from reading Kent Worcester’s a West Indian Black who had received a classical education took a different position on the American struggle from the Johnson-Forest Tendency in the Socialist Workers Party. James also had his own understanding of Marxism. The Johnson-Forest Tendency thought that the underclass as a whole was in the forefront of the movement and they were looking at workers more globally. C.L.R. and the group that became were looking more particularly at the workers in the industrial plants as being in the foreground of the movements of fights bringing revolutionary change. Therefore they believed that we should concentrate on those workers in the plant who would provide leadership of the movement. Having recognized that workers would take the lead it seemed that there would be a worker coming out of the plant who would be the leader. Therefore it seemed natural that James Boggs should be the agreed upon leader of the newly established group And despite his segregated high school education and his Southern upbringing Boggs gave inspired leadership to the group and to the Black community. Glaberman saw a new generation of militant leftist Blacks emerging in Detroit and at Wayne State University. That was how Conrad Mallett and I and our wives Dolores Wilson and Gwendolyn Mallett all militant leftist graduate students were recruited as members and writers for . I was working on my doctorate and Conrad was working on his and our wives were working on their master’s degrees. We were supporting John Watson a student who had seized control of the Wayne State University student paper and did so from a revolutionary point of view. That was one of the things that was happening on Wayne State campus. We met autoworkers that were studying at Wayne State and because of our involvement in the radical activities on campus we also got involved with the autoworkers movement. Some workers in the auto plants attended the bulk of those attending our meetings were autoworkers. In our group we talked about what was happening in Detroit because Detroit seemed to be in the forefront of much of what was going on in the United States. It was really a hotbed of what seemed to be the revolutionary movement: the struggle in the school with the teachers strike and the struggle in the auto plants the Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement. There was a struggle in the plants and in the union fighting on two fronts: fighting the bosses in the plant but also fighting the old union leadership for recognition. The old union leadership was white-led and came down on the Blacks struggling—it was that transition from the 1930s of the union movement to the emerging revolutionary union movement of the 1960s. The Reuther-led movement of the 1930s had been progressive in its time but the Black workers were rising up and challenging that leadership. Jimmy Boggs was in the middle of that which is why he seemed to be the natural leader of went into “decline” in the early 1960s and after that he makes no further comments about the newsletter. This is incorrect; in fact this was the moment of rise in influence and importance as a regional paper. James Boggs was invited to speak at the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions in Santa Barbara by its president Robert Hutchins and its vice president W.H. Ferry. Boggs began a correspondence with Thomas Merton the Trappist monk and social activist as well as with the famous British philosopher and pacifist Bertrand Russell. I had also begun a much-discussed exchange of views with the Rev. Albert Cleage and sometime political candidate. Cleage created the Shrine of the Black Madonna and several “Shriners ” as his followers were called were in positions of power in the city administration well as on the city council. I argued that the Shrine philosophy was a version of Black capitalism and not at all revolutionary. Our exchanges received a lot of attention at the time. went into decline in the early 1960s the paper actually flourished for a number of years even after C.L.R. James left the organization. The organization did break up some years later and I disagreed with Grace Lee Boggs’ perspective. She was influenced by Rev. Cleage and by his call for a combination of Black nationalism and revolution. His followers held positions on the city council and the school board and were influential. We felt their program was Black capitalism. “It seems evident at some point in the 1950s [Grace] Lee and other members of her circle had lost faith in Marxism’s social-scientific explanatory power.” Though “they still maintained a commitment to socialist principles … their vision of humanity’s future was … centered on the state of working class consciousness.” In any case we disagreed with their perspective and so our two groups separated. managing editor of the leftist magazine .

The Indians simplified 4 by joining its four lines into a cross that looks like our modern plus sign. The Sunga and other Indians would add a horizontal line on top of the numeral and the Kshatrapa and Pallava changed the numeral to a point where speed of writing was at best a secondary concern. The did not have time for cursive fancy: Their 4 still had the early concept of the cross but for the sake of efficiency was made in one stroke by connecting the ""western"" end to the ""northern"" end; the ""eastern"" end was finished off with a curve. The Europeans dropped off the finishing curve and gradually made the numeral less cursive ending up with a glyph very close to the original Brahmin cross.

There are infinitely many convex regular polygons (two-dimensional); five convex regular polyhedra (three-dimensional the five Platonic Solids); six convex regular polychora (four-dimensional); and three regular convex polytopes occupying each higher-dimensional space. The smallest non-cyclic group has four elements; it is the Klein four-group. Four is also the order of the smallest non-trivial groups that are not simple. Four is the maximum number of dimensions of a real division algebra (the quaternions) by a theorem of Ferdinand Georg Frobenius. The four-color theorem states that a planar graph (or of two-dimensional regions such as countries) can be colored using four colors so that adjacent vertices (or regions) are always different colors. Three colors are not sufficient to guarantee this. The largest planar complete graph has four vertices. Lagrange's four-square theorem states that every positive integer can be written as the sum of at most four square numbers. Three are not always sufficient; 7 for instance cannot be written as the sum of three squares. Four is the first positive non-Fibonacci number.

1620765490.307365,84056581,https://pc.net/news/2016-09-23/iphone_7_review,"iPhone 7 Review - One Week Later Waking up at 1:55 AM CDT on September 9 was worth it.  I was able to access the online Apple Store at 2:09 AM and was one of the first people to order the new with a delivery date of September 16.  A few minutes of clicking refresh is better than waiting several hours in line at a physical Apple Store I ordered the 256 GB Jet Black iPhone 7 for AT&T.  The purchase and financing options were confusing but I ended up choosing the Apple iPhone Upgrade Program which includes AppleCare+ and an option to upgrade in 12 months.  It was only $5 more per month than the other options so I figured it was worth it. The iPhone 7's design is striking in the sense it is strikingly similar to the iPhone 6.  It is the exact same size as the iPhone 6 and 6s and all the buttons are in the same places.  That means an iPhone 6 case should fit the camera lens on the back has been moved and is shaped differently so most old cases won't work.  Wa wa... Even though the iPhone has the exact same shape it feels better in my hand than the 6 because of the all-glass enclosure.  It has significantly better grip which means a case may not be necessary.  (IMO iPhone cases are best at preventing drops rather than saving the iPhone when they happen.)  Still the phone slides like crazy on any smooth surface so I'll probably still get a case for mine.  If I do use a case I think I'll get one that allows the color to show through it since I really like the jet black finish.  The entire phone is completely black (except for the flash) which for some reason makes me happy. the iPhone 7 is Rated IP67 under IEC standard 60529.  That of course means it is water and dust resistant.  About time Apple. I'm one of those people who uses the speakers in my iPhone a lot.  Not for phone calls but for playing music and watching StarCraft 2 replays.  I was excited about the second speaker in the iPhone 7 but I found it underwhelming.  The overall sound isn't much louder than the 6 and it has too much treble.  I switched the EQ from the Rock setting (which I used on my old iPhone) to the Jazz setting which fits this model much better.  Even so it sounds like the signal has that Sony Xpand effect which makes some things sound better and other things sound way too hollow.  I wish Apple would include a graphic equalizer for the overall sound but maybe that is too much to ask. ▶ A quick note about the two speakers.  It will sound weird if you listen to stereo sound from the iPhone's external speakers while holding it vertically.  This is because the left and right channels are meant to be side by side not stacked on top of each other. there is none.  Get over it.  Apple includes an adapter for 3.5mm audio connectors and additional ones are only $9.00. The headset that comes with the iPhone 7 of course uses the Lightning connector which is the only connector on the phone.  The Lightning headphones sound absolutely amazing.  The 100% digital connection is noticeably clearer and the frequency response seems flatter (which is a good thing).  Bundled earbuds should not sound this good.  But they do. is several times faster than the iPhone 6 and the graphics performance is supposedly 240x faster than the original iPhone.  The real-world performance does not feel that extreme but it is fast.  Everything feels more responsive on the 7 compared to the 6.  The Touch ID response is so fast While I didn't perform any scientific benchmarks I did run one important test.  I timed how long it took Pokémon Go to load when it was not already running.  The Pokémon Go loading times for each phone are below. iPhone 6: 32.75 seconds to get to loading screen 12.22 seconds to load = 45.97 seconds iPhone 7: 12.04 seconds to get to loading screen 3.46 seconds to load = 15.51 seconds I also have not run any scientific tests with the iPhone 7 battery.   However over the past week I've used the phone more than usual and I have yet to use up more than half a charge in a full day.  That is a good sign. Apple always hypes up the new iPhone cameras.  And the improvements are always modest.  The same holds true for this model.  However the iPhone 7 has optical image stabilization which is awesome.  It makes photos less blurry especially in low light.  I've taken a few photos at night and they all look really good.  But the real test is to let my dad use it in low light and see if he can get a clear photo. "" camera.  It is now 7 and can record 1080p video.  That means the front camera is finally suitable for selfies. External speakers not as good as expected Nobody expected the iPhone 7 to be groundbreaking.  But it is a pretty impressive upgrade.  Apple added just about everything I wanted in a new model — water resistance and a higher resolution front camera. I don't think the 7 is a necessary upgrade if you have an iPhone 6s or even a 6 but if you decide to get one I think you'll like it.  After all Please enable JavaScript to view the ",[],No,,
