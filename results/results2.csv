Like Perl Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages. is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python: − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP. − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs. − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects. − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games. It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP. It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications. It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking. It can be easily integrated with C Just to give you a little excitement about Python I'm going to give you a small conventional Python Hello World program You can try it using Demo link. Python is one of the most widely used language over the web. I'm going to list few of them here: and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly. − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes. − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain. − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code. − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms. − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient. − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases. − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls and the X Window system of Unix. − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting. is designed for software programmers who need to learn Python programming language from scratch. You should have a basic understanding of Computer Programming terminologies. A basic understanding of any of the programming languages is a plus. © Copyright 2021.

Flash onto the Device Build and Flash with Eclipse IDE Getting Started with VS Code IDE This document is intended to help you set up the software development environment for the hardware based on the ESP32 chip by Espressif. a simple example will show you how to use ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework) for menu configuration then for building and flashing firmware onto an ESP32 board. This is documentation for the master branch (latest version) of ESP-IDF. This version is under continual development. ESP32 is a system on a chip that integrates the following features: Dual high performance Xtensa® 32-bit LX6 CPU cores which helps meet the continuous demands for efficient power usage Espressif provides basic hardware and software resources to help application developers realize their ideas using the ESP32 series hardware. The software development framework by Espressif is intended for development of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications with Wi-Fi power management and several other system features. - USB A / micro USB B You have a choice to either download and install the following software manually - CMake and Ninja to build a full that essentially contains API (software libraries and source code) for ESP32 and scripts to operate the get through the onboarding process using the following official plugins for integrated development environments (IDE) described in separate documents If you have one of ESP32 development boards listed below you can click on the link to learn more about its hardware. This is a detailed roadmap to walk you through the installation process. Step 3. Set up the tools Step 4. Set up the environment variables Step 9. Flash onto the Device Some tools need to be installed on the computer before proceeding to the next steps. Follow the links below for the instructions for your OS: on Windows as an installation folder for ESP-IDF. You can use any directory but you will need to adjust paths for the commands respectively. Keep in mind that ESP-IDF does not support spaces in paths. To build applications for the ESP32 you need the software libraries provided by Espressif in navigate to your installation directory and clone the repository with following instructions below specific to your operating system. and run the following commands: for information about which ESP-IDF version to use in a given situation. In addition to installing the tools for Windows introduced in Step 1 can also download a copy of ESP-IDF. for information about which ESP-IDF version to use in a given situation. If you wish to download ESP-IDF without the help of ESP-IDF Tools Installer Step 3. Set up the tools you also need to install the tools used by ESP-IDF for Windows introduced in Step 1 installs all the required tools. If you want to install the tools without the help of ESP-IDF Tools Installer open the Command Prompt and follow these steps: The tools installer downloads a number of files attached to GitHub Releases. If accessing GitHub is slow then it is possible to set an environment variable to prefer Espressif’s download server for GitHub asset downloads. This setting only controls individual tools downloaded from GitHub releases it doesn’t change the URLs used to access any Git repositories. To prefer the Espressif download server when running the ESP-IDF Tools Installer check out the following option in the installer window: Configuring the ESP-IDF Tools Setup Wizard Espressif download server To prefer the Espressif download server when installing tools use the following sequence of commands when running The scripts introduced in this step install compilation tools required by ESP-IDF inside the user home directory: on Windows. If you wish to install the tools into a different directory before running the installation scripts. Make sure that your user account has sufficient permissions to read and write this path. make sure it is set to the same value every time the Install script ( ) and an Export script ( Step 4. Set up the environment variables The installed tools are not yet added to the PATH environment variable. To make the tools usable from the command line some environment variables must be set. ESP-IDF provides another script which does that. for Windows creates an “ESP-IDF Command Prompt” shortcut in the Start Menu. This shortcut opens the Command Prompt and sets up all the required environment variables. You can open this shortcut and proceed to the next step. if you want to use ESP-IDF in an existing Command Prompt window In the terminal where you are going to use ESP-IDF or for fish (supported only since fish version 3.0.0): Note the space between the leading dot and the path! If you plan to use esp-idf frequently you can create an alias for executing Copy and paste the following command to your shell’s profile ( Refresh the configuration by restarting the terminal session or by running to set up or refresh the esp-idf environment in any terminal session. to your shell’s profile directly; however it is not recommended. Doing so activates IDF virtual environment in every terminal session (including those where IDF is not needed) defeating the purpose of the virtual environment and likely affecting other software. Now you are ready to prepare your application for ESP32. You can start with There is a range of example projects in the directory in ESP-IDF. You can copy any project in the same way as presented above and run it. It is also possible to build examples in-place The ESP-IDF build system does not support spaces in the paths to either ESP-IDF or to projects. Now connect your ESP32 board to the computer and check under what serial port the board is visible. Serial ports have the following patterns in their names: If you are not sure how to check the serial port name Keep the port name handy as you will need it in the next steps. set ESP32 chip as the target and run the project configuration utility after opening a new project. If the project contains some existing builds and configuration they will be cleared and initialized. The target may be saved in environment variable to skip this step at all. See If the previous steps have been done correctly You are using this menu to set up project specific variables e.g. Wi-Fi network name and password etc. Setting up the project with menuconfig may be skipped for “hello_word”. This example will run with default configuration. If you use ESP32-DevKitC board with the enable single core mode ( ) in menuconfig before flashing examples. The colors of the menu could be different in your terminal. You can change the appearance with the option This command will compile the application and all ESP-IDF components then it will generate the bootloader $ idf.py build

or run 'idf.py -p PORT flash' the build will finish by generating the firmware binary .bin files. Step 9. Flash onto the Device Flash the binaries that you just built (bootloader.bin partition-table.bin and hello-world.bin) onto your ESP32 board by running: Replace PORT with your ESP32 board’s serial port name from You can also change the flasher baud rate by replacing BAUD with the baud rate you need. The default baud rate is For more information on idf.py arguments automatically builds and flashes the project If you run the given command and see errors such as “Failed to connect” there might be several reasons for this. One of the reasons might be issues encountered by the utility that is called by the build system to reset the chip interact with the ROM bootloader and flash firmware. One simple solution to try is manual reset described below and if it does not help you can find more details about possible issues in resets ESP32 automatically by asserting DTR and RTS control lines of the USB to serial converter chip FTDI or CP210x (for more information ). The DTR and RTS control lines are in turn connected to thus changes in the voltage levels of DTR and RTS will boot ESP32 into Firmware Download mode. As an example for the ESP32 DevKitC development board. you should have no problems with the official esp-idf development boards. However is not able to reset your hardware automatically in the following cases: Your hardware does not have the DTR and RTS lines connected to The DTR and RTS lines are configured differently There are no such serial control lines at all Depending on the kind of hardware you have it may also be possible to manually put your ESP32 board into Firmware Download mode (reset). For development boards produced by Espressif this information can be found in the respective getting started guides or user guides. For example to manually reset an esp-idf development board you will see the output log similar to the following: ...

To exit IDF monitor use the shortcut If IDF monitor fails shortly after the upload if instead of the messages above you see random garbage similar to what is given below your board is likely using a 26 MHz crystal. Most development board designs use 40 MHz so ESP-IDF uses this frequency as a default value. If you have such a problem Go to Component config –> ESP32-specific –> Main XTAL frequency flashing and monitoring into one step by running: for handy shortcuts and more details on using IDF monitor. That’s all that you need to get started with ESP32! Now you are ready to try some other or go straight to developing your own applications. Some of examples do not support ESP32 because required hardware is not included in ESP32 so it cannot be supported. please check the README file for the table. If this is present including ESP32 target or the table does not exist at all the example will work on ESP32. You should update ESP-IDF from time to time as newer versions fix bugs and provide new features. The simplest way to do the update is to delete the existing as if performing the initial installation described in Another solution is to update only what has changed. The update procedure depends on the version of ESP-IDF you are using execute the Install script again in case the new ESP-IDF version requires different versions of tools. See instructions at Step 3.

Python 3.9 was released on October 5th type hinting generics in standard collections; relaxed grammar restrictions on decorators. string methods to remove prefixes and suffixes. New features in the standard library: flexible function and variable annotations; added that allows process management without races
and signals. fast access to module state from methods of C extension
types; CPython now uses a new parser based on PEG; a number of Python builtins (range dict) are
now sped up using garbage collection does not block on resurrected objects; a number of Python modules ( ) now use multiphase initialization as defined
by PEP 489; a number of standard library modules ( ) are now using
the stable ABI defined by PEP 384. the IANA Time Zone Database is now present in the standard
library in the an implementation of a topological sort of a graph is now provided in
the new CPython adopts an annual release cycle. You should check for DeprecationWarning in your code When Python 2.7 was still supported a lot of functionality in Python 3
was kept for backward compatibility with Python 2.7. With the end of Python
2 support these backward compatibility layers have been removed or will
be removed soon. Most of them emitted a can be used to ignore warnings from third-party code. Python 3.9 is the last version providing those Python 2 backward compatibility

next Python version. Note: a number of pre-existing deprecations were removed in this version of
Python as well. Consult the ) operators have been added to the built-in for a full description.
(Contributed by Brandt Bucher in New String Methods to Remove Prefixes and Suffixes have been added
to easily remove an unneeded prefix or a suffix from a string. Corresponding for a full description. (Contributed by Dennis Sweeney in Type Hinting Generics in Standard Collections In type annotations you can now use built-in collection types such as as generic types instead of importing the
corresponding capitalized types (e.g. .  Some other types in the standard library are also now generic for more details.  (Contributed by Guido van Rossum Python 3.9 uses a new parser .  The new
parser’s performance is roughly comparable to that of the old parser but the PEG formalism is more flexible than LL(1) when it comes to
designing new language features.  We’ll start using this flexibility
in Python 3.10 and later. module uses the new parser and produces the same AST as
the old parser. the old parser will be deleted and so will all
functionality that depends on it (primarily the which has long been deprecated).  In Python 3.9 you can switch
back to the LL(1) parser using a command line switch ( ) or an environment variable ( for more details.  (Contributed by Guido van Rossum Pablo Galindo and Lysandros Nikolaou in which used to occur when a relative import went past

(Contributed by Victor Stinner in arguments are now checked for string encoding and
decoding operations. Examples: argument is only checked at
the first encoding/decoding error and the argument is sometimes
ignored for empty strings.

compatibility with subinterpreters and predictability in their shutdown
processes. (Contributed by Kyle Stanley in only when there are no available idle workers to reuse. This optimizes
startup overhead and reduces the amount of lost CPU time to idle workers.

case) White space characters within attributes are now preserved when serializing to XML file. EOLNs are no longer normalized
to “n”. This is the result of discussion about how to interpret
section 2.11 of XML spec.
(Contributed by Mefistotelis in Optimized the idiom for assignment a temporary variable in comprehensions.
Now in comprehensions is as fast as a simple assignment sums = [s for s in [0] for x in data for s in [s + x]] operator this idiom does not leak a variable to the
outer scope. Optimized signal handling in multithreaded applications. If a thread different
than the main thread gets a signal the bytecode evaluation loop is no longer
interrupted at each bytecode instruction to check for pending signals which
cannot be handled. Only the main thread of the main interpreter can handle
signals. the bytecode evaluation loop was interrupted at each instruction
until the main thread handles signals.
(Contributed by Victor Stinner in Kubilay Kocak and Victor
Stinner in is now up to 1.87x faster for values that
fit into A number of Python builtins ( ) are now sped up by using Jeroen Demeyer and Petr Viktorin in for the case when the other set
is much larger than the base set.
(Suggested by Evgeny Kapun with code contributed by Michele Orrù in ) now allows (no more than)
one empty arena to remain available for immediate reuse without returning
it to the OS.  This prevents thrashing in simple loops where an arena could
be created and destroyed anew on each iteration.

didn’t help improve optimization of the final executable. This
speeds up the task by a factor of about 15x.  Running the full unit test
suite is slow.  This change may result in a slightly less optimized build
since not as many code branches will be executed.  If you are willing to
wait for the much slower build the old behavior can be restored using .  We make no
guarantees as to which PGO task set produces a faster build.  Users who care
should run their own relevant benchmarks as results can depend on the

How to Get Started With Python? you will learn to install and run Python on your computer. Once we do that we will also write our first Python program. Python is a cross-platform programming language which means that it can run on multiple platforms like Windows and has even been ported to the Java and .NET virtual machines. It is free and open-source. Even though most of today's Linux and Mac have Python pre-installed in it the version might be out-of-date. So it is always a good idea to install the most current version. The Easiest Way to Run Python The easiest way to run Python is by using The Thonny IDE comes with the latest version of Python bundled in it. So you don't have to install Python separately. Follow the following steps to run Python on your computer. . Then save the file with Write Python code in the file and save it. If you don't want to use Thonny here's how you can install and run Python on your computer. Run the installer file and follow the steps to install Python . This will add Python to environment variables and you can run Python from any part of the computer. Once you finish the installation process 1. Run Python in Immediate mode in the command line will invoke the interpreter in immediate mode. We can directly type in Python code and press Enter to get the output. as the output. This prompt can be used as a calculator. To exit this mode Running Python on the Command Line 2. Run Python in the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) We can use any text editing software to write a Python script file. We just need to save it with the extension. But using an IDE can make our life a lot easier. IDE is a piece of software that provides useful features like code hinting etc. to the programmer for application development. is also installed. You can use it to run Python on your computer. It's a decent IDE for beginners. an interactive Python Shell is opened. Now you can create a new file and save it with Write Python code in the file and save it. To run the file Running a Python program in IDLE Now that we have Python up and running we can write our first Python program. Let's create a very simple program called is a simple program that outputs on the screen. Since it's a very simple program it's often used to introduce a new programming language to beginners. Type the following code in any text editor or an IDE and save it as run the file. You will get the following output. Congratulations!

describes the standard library that is distributed with Python. It also
describes some of the optional components that are commonly included
in Python distributions. Python’s standard library is very extensive offering a wide range of
facilities as indicated by the long table of contents listed below. The
library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to
system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be
inaccessible to Python programmers as well as modules written in Python
that provide standardized solutions for many problems that occur in
everyday programming. Some of these modules are explicitly designed to
encourage and enhance the portability of Python programs by abstracting
away platform-specifics into platform-neutral APIs. The Python installers for the Windows platform usually include
the entire standard library and often also include many additional
components. For Unix-like operating systems Python is normally provided
as a collection of packages so it may be necessary to use the packaging
tools provided with the operating system to obtain some or all of the
optional components. In addition to the standard library there is a growing collection of
several thousand components (from individual programs and modules to
packages and entire application development frameworks) — Completion function for GNU readline — Interpret bytes as packed binary data — Codec registry and base classes — Basic date and time types — Abstract Base Classes for Containers — Efficient arrays of numeric values — Dynamic type creation and names for built-in types — Shallow and deep copy operations — Functionality to operate with graph-like structures — Mathematical functions for complex numbers — Decimal fixed point and floating point arithmetic — Functions creating iterators for efficient looping — Higher-order functions and operations on callable objects — Iterate over lines from multiple input streams — Generate temporary files and directories — Unix style pathname pattern expansion — Random access to text lines — DB-API 2.0 interface for SQLite databases — Compression using the LZMA algorithm — Read and write tar archive files — CSV File Reading and Writing — Encode and decode XDR data — Secure hashes and message digests — Generate secure random numbers for managing secrets — Core tools for working with streams — C-style parser for command line options — Terminal handling for character-cell displays — Text input widget for curses programs — A panel stack extension for curses —  Access to underlying platform’s identifying data — A foreign function library for Python —  Provides shared memory for direct access across processes — TLS/SSL wrapper for socket objects — Set handlers for asynchronous events — An email and MIME handling package — Manipulate mailboxes in various formats — Map filenames to MIME types — Encode and decode binhex4 files — Convert between binary and ASCII — Encode and decode MIME quoted-printable data — Encode and decode uuencode files — Simple HTML and XHTML parser — Definitions of HTML general entities — The Document Object Model API — Support for building partial DOM trees — Base classes for SAX handlers — Fast XML parsing using Expat — Traceback manager for CGI scripts — WSGI Utilities and Reference Implementation — Extensible library for opening URLs — Response classes used by urllib — Exception classes raised by urllib.request — A framework for network servers — Cookie handling for HTTP clients — XMLRPC server and client modules — Read and write AIFF and AIFC files — Read and write Sun AU files — Read and write WAV files — Determine the type of an image — Determine type of sound file — Access to OSS-compatible audio devices — Support for line-oriented command interpreters — Documentation generator and online help system Effects of the Python Development Mode 2to3 - Automated Python 2 to 3 code translation — Regression tests package for Python — Utilities for the Python test suite — Utilities for the Python execution tests — Support tools for testing correct bytecode generation — Measure execution time of small code snippets — Trace or track Python statement execution — Building and installing Python modules — Manage executable Python zip archives — Provide access to Python’s configuration information — Print or retrieve a stack traceback — Import modules from Zip archives — Find modules used by a script — Locating and executing Python modules — Access to the compiler’s symbol tables — Constants used with Python parse trees — Constants used with Python parse trees — Read and write Microsoft Installer files — Useful routines from the MS VC++ runtime — The most common POSIX system calls — Function to check Unix passwords — Interface to Sun’s NIS (Yellow Pages) — Parser for command line options ",[],Yes,"technology:0.17835554480552673,business:0.04691684991121292",

What is while loop in Python? Syntax of while Loop in Python Loops are used in programming to repeat a specific block of code. In this article you will learn to create a while loop in Python. What is while loop in Python? The while loop in Python is used to iterate over a block of code as long as the test expression (condition) is true. We generally use this loop when we don't know the number of times to iterate beforehand. Syntax of while Loop in Python test expression is checked first. The body of the loop is entered only if the the test expression is checked again. This process continues until the the body of the while loop is determined through indentation. The body starts with indentation and the first unindented line marks the end. Python interprets any non-zero value as Flowchart for while loop in Python # Program to add natural
# numbers up to 
# sum = 1+2+3+...+n

# To take input from the user # n = int(input(""Enter n: ""))

n = 10

# initialize sum and counter
sum = 0
i = 1

while i <= n:
    sum = sum + i
    i = i+1    # update counter

# print the sum
print(""The sum is"" Enter n: 10
The sum is 55 the test expression will be as long as our counter variable is less than or equal to We need to increase the value of the counter variable in the body of the loop. This is very important (and mostly forgotten). Failing to do so will result in an infinite loop (never-ending loop). while loops can also have an optional part is executed if the condition in the while loop evaluates to The while loop can be terminated with a part runs if no break occurs and the condition is false. Here is an example to illustrate this. '''Example to illustrate
the use of else statement
with the while loop'''

counter = 0

while counter < 3:
    print(""Inside loop"")
    counter = counter + 1
else:
    print(""Inside else"") we use a counter variable to print the string Join our newsletter for the latest updates. Join our newsletter for the latest updates. Java

How to access elements from a list? How to slice lists in Python? How to change or add elements to a list? How to delete or remove elements from a list? we'll learn everything about Python lists adding or removing elements from them and so on. Python offers a range of compound data types often referred to as sequences. List is one of the most frequently used and very versatile data types used in Python. a list is created by placing all the items (elements) inside square brackets It can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer # empty list
my_list = []

# list of integers
my_list = [1 3]

# list with mixed data types
my_list = [1 A list can also have another list as an item. This is called a nested list. There are various ways in which we can access the elements of a list. We can use the index operator to access an item in a list. In Python indices start at 0. So a list having 5 elements will have an index from 0 to 4. Trying to access indexes other than these will raise an . The index must be an integer. We can't use float or other types Nested lists are accessed using nested indexing. 'e']

TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices Python allows negative indexing for its sequences. The index of -1 refers to the last item -2 to the second last item and so on. # Negative indexing in lists
my_list = ['p' When we run the above program we will get the following output: How to slice lists in Python? We can access a range of items in a list by using the slicing operator # List slicing in Python

my_list = ['p' 'z']

# elements 3rd to 5th
print(my_list[2:5])

# elements beginning to 4th
print(my_list[:-5])

# elements 6th to end
print(my_list[5:])

# elements beginning to end
print(my_list[:]) Slicing can be best visualized by considering the index to be between the elements as shown below. So if we want to access a range we need two indices that will slice that portion from the list. Element Slicing from a list in Python meaning their elements can be changed unlike We can use the assignment operator to change an item or a range of items. # Correcting mistake values in a list
odd = [2 8]

# change the 1st item    
odd[0] = 1

odd = [1 operator to combine two lists. This is also called concatenation. operator repeats a list for the given number of times. # Concatenating and repeating lists
odd = [1 we can insert one item at a desired location by using the method or insert multiple items by squeezing it into an empty slice of a list. # Demonstration of list insert() method
odd = [1 We can delete one or more items from a list using the keyword . It can even delete the list entirely. # Deleting list items
my_list = ['p' 'm']

# delete one item

Add an element to the end of the list Add all elements of a list to the another list Insert an item at the defined index Removes an item from the list Removes and returns an element at the given index - Removes all items from the list - Returns the index of the first matched item - Returns the count of the number of items passed as an argument - Sort items in a list in ascending order - Reverse the order of items in the list eturns a shallow copy of the list Some examples of Python list methods: # Python list methods

Your Ultimate Solution for Goal Setting you’ll learn the steps of achieving and succeeding when setting the goals. Understand What You Truly Want to Achieve to dig deep into your desires. The purpose of this framework is to be asking yourself the question “why?” five times. Every single time you ask why you’re getting to the source of why you started goal setting in the first place. Let’s say your initial want is to Why do you want to make more money? “Because I want to buy a big house.” Why do you want a big house? “Because living in a big house is comfortable” Why does only a big house make you comfortable? “Because I have a big family with a wife and three kids; we need a big house for everyone.” Why do you want a big house for everyone to live in? “Because I want them to live in a comfortable place.” “Because I love my family and I want them to be happy.” Can you now see the clear difference between the initial want and the true purpose at the end? In this example you thought you wanted more money; but in reality what you truly want is for your family to be happy. While making more money and getting a big house could do that how you treat your family and the time you spend with them are key elements too. and start accomplishing significant personal goals with personal accountability – without limiting beliefs. What is the direction and meaning of the goal I’m pursuing? Example: I want to lose 50 pounds. – Will the goal be able to be measured? Example: Every week I will weigh in and Example: I have spare time and money to devote to losing weight. Does the goal align with my inner self? I want to look good during the summer. – When will the goal need to be met? Example: I have a year to lose 50 pounds. setting that will get you started on creating a . You want to have every step written down before you start your life-changing mission. when planning your goals will make it easier to accomplish them. Ultimately a SMARTER goal is something that has an added incentive to do it.

To create a milestone it has to meet the following criteria: It can be completed within the span of a month — Break down your plan into milestones. These will be bite-sized steps that once completed you can check off on your way to completing your long-term goal. Create a backup plan in case any milestones fail — You should have a back-up plan in case life gets in the way. You might find the following quick example helpful: Let’s say that your goal is to get a new job. You could map out this goal using a plan such as this one: Decide what kind of job you’re looking for – Why you are doing something. – The benefits that this task is bringing you. – What you have to give up or invest to achieve that value. is going to make it easier to achieve your goals. When you’re seeing the results you want and getting to celebrate them it’ll be easier to continue creating bigger and more impactful goals. Every time you complete a milestone Ensure that the rewards are proportionate to the milestone. IE: If you applied for a job that doesn’t mean you should buy yourself an expensive suit. is one method to ensure you’re staying on track. But despite all the planning done remember that plans can still fall short. Planning around Planner’s fallacy means ensuring that you have a back-up plan in mind and are open to the idea of reviewing and making adjustments to your milestones or plans should you fail. One other consideration to consider is to download The Foolproof Guide to Reaching Goal This Year we share more plans to consider to reach your goals. The issue is that when you put together a plan you can become stubborn when your plan changes. Here is how you can avoid it: Pay attention to your track record : As the saying goes “plan for the worst” this is all about determining the worst possible scenario and figuring out how to overcome it. : Instead of focusing on the result you’re putting more focus on the actions that get you to the results. 19 Best To-Do List Apps to Keep You on Track 10 Best Calendar Apps to Stay on Track Make it a weekly activity to . If you’ve made a small step towards your goal celebrate it through your reward system. If you didn’t consider what you need to do to make sure you’re staying on track. Create An Environment That Helps Your Goal . Things like cleaning your desk letting more natural light in being around different people could be what you need to get your mind into focus. then you’d probably fail to achieve your aim. by getting your environment right such as by only stocking healthy food in your home you’ll give yourself the best chance of success. Add to that making yourself accountable — perhaps by getting your partner on board with your goal — and you’ll start to find the motivation you need. If you keep reviewing your progress and reward yourself every time you hit one of your incremental targets then you’ll have everything you need to help you reach your weight loss goal. But this is only the tip of the iceberg for consistency. You can run – You might be taking on your social circle’s dreams or your parents. When this happens it’s going to be hard to stay consistent. You may feel overwhelmed with your dream – Chasing a dream is a huge undertaking because it can be mentally taxing. Trying to become a famous singer can lead to disappointment due to it being unrealistic. On the flip side having a goal to create music every week is going to drive you in the same direction but without the unneeded stress of becoming famous. You have a cluttered mind and no organization – Organization of your mind and your space is key to thriving. If you’re easily distracted or suffer from an unclear mind take a few moments to take deep breaths throughout the day or – Why do you want to pursue this goal? Why be consistent with this habit? Knowing the answers to those questions is critical to be consistent. Not only that but you need to have a great reason (or more) to keep at it. you have naive practice and purposeful practice. is where most people are at and it satisfies the following conditions: You treat your goal like a hobby where it’s something you do once in a while. the scale of the challenge is low. You raise the bar in small increments or you continue to perform the same thing. For example you may be playing the same song on an instrument or writing the same form of article. Tailor your goal to something more specific. For example instead of practicing the same song constantly add a layer of challenge to it. Say you’ll play the song multiple times in a row without making a single mistake. Develop a strategy to help you achieve your objective. Have a clear and concise reason to push yourself. Satisfy the previous conditions of purposeful practice Ensure the practice you’re doing is in a performance-based field. I.e. The field that you’re practicing has a clear distinction between those who are experts and those who are novices. Have a system or mentor to guide you to condition your mind for action. 4. Stick With Your Set Goals is a solid way to ensure you are committed to holding yourself accountable and working towards your set goals. It’s an extra incentive to be performing your best. Examples of additional accountability are things like giving people or yourself updates on your progress and celebrating. This is a key way to stick to your goals provides an extra incentive as the ideal partner will encourage you to stay motivated and focus on your set goals. You can also add another layer of challenge by involving money. Paying a trusted friend at the end of the week if you don’t hit your goal is a great incentive to perform.

Video: Python Dictionaries to Store key/value Pairs Python dictionary is an unordered collection of items. Each item of a dictionary has a Dictionaries are optimized to retrieve values when the key is known. Creating a dictionary is as simple as placing items inside curly braces that is expressed as a pair ( While the values can be of any data type and can repeat keys must be of immutable type ( with immutable elements) and must be unique. # empty dictionary

Most people find it hard to remember what they’ve learned which inevitably makes their learning slow and painful. if you’d love to learn but find it difficult then you’ve come to the right place. In this guide you’ll find dozens of proven techniques for learning anything fast. So read on and discover how to become a superlearner. 1. Struggle to Kickstart Learning Something From Scratch you might have wanted to learn how to play chess but didn’t know the best way to do this. And because you didn’t know the best way you either didn’t bother trying to learn the classic or you tried learning from multiple sources at the same time: books The problem with this scattered approach is that you will find it hard to focus and you’ll inevitably be given conflicting advice — which is unhelpful when you’re starting out. The other problem is that by consulting books and asking friends for help you might find that you’re not getting the latest information. For instance your friends might not be aware of some of the amazing computer chess learning programs that are available online. 2. Struggle to Recall What You’ve Learned this problem continues from education into the workplace. How many times have you been in meetings where important things have been said only for half the attendees to forget the details soon after the meeting concluded. With these types of negative life experiences it’s no wonder that as people get older they are less willing to try learning new things. 3. Struggle to Put What You’ve Learned Into Practice consider for a moment how people learn to ride a bicycle. a parent or elder sibling would tell you the steps you need to take to successfully get on and begin riding a bike. However it’s only when you attempt to ride a bike for the first time that the real learning begins! It’s the same with most things. However many tutorial videos you watch on a certain subject until you start to do the thing you want to learn you’ll struggle to make any real progress. 4. Get Overwhelmed When Learning A Lot Of Difficult Things If all a teacher did was force you to learn grammar rules for weeks on end you would no doubt call a halt to your learning. However if they made learning the new language fun and immersive you would not only want to keep learning but you’d grow your confidence too. And of course you could still gradually learn the required grammar and vocabulary. 5. Can’t Seem To Learn It No Matter How Hard You Work This is a very common problem. many people make the problem worse by putting more and more effort and practice into what they’re trying to learn. This is actually counterproductive as — without an effective approach to learning — time and effort alone will not be enough for you to succeed. The good news is there are tried-and-tested ways to learn quickly and effectively. I call this approach ‘smart learning’. Let’s look now at what it’s all about and how you can start using it in your life right now. While Vanderbilt University recognizes more than 70 different learning styles that you need to be aware of: They are learners who learn best by seeing (e.g. through photos These are learners who learn best by hearing (e.g. through podcasts and audiobooks). These learners learn best by reading and writing (e.g. through books They are learners who learn best by moving and doing (e.g. starting to learn to drive by getting behind the wheel). The 3 Stages of Learning That Help You Learn Effectively : From the moment we’re born we’ve been learning new things every day. And without consciously thinking about it we’ve used at least one of the three stages of learning to gain knowledge and skills. The three stages of learning are: The student has now become a proficient dancer and they are able to perform skills with accuracy and consistency. They are also able to concentrate on complex tasks and they have the ability to adapt their performance where needed. This workbook will help you understand the stages of learning and your current stage of learning enabling you to improve the way you learn and master the skills you want. Check out our FREE online workbook about the Stages of Learning to find out more about this: This is where you engage in both practical and theoretical learning putting you in the best possible position for learning rapidly and successfully. Let me give you an example to illustrate this process in action: You want to learn how to play drums perhaps as a potential career — or perhaps both! Whether you choose to work with a personal drum tutor or learn from books and videos the key element will be to have access to a drum kit so you can regularly practice and develop your drumming skills. This kit could be in your home or it might be in a rehearsal space that you have access to once or twice a week. Theory plus practical application is a powerful combination that will help you develop your skills and knowledge in the quickest possible time with the advent of YouTube and online courses many people nowadays choose to self-learn. This has the benefit of being cheaper and on-demand. In other words you can learn when and where you want to rather than having to go to a specific place at a specific time. This gives you freedom to learn new things without impacting on your current work and social schedules. 9 Remote Learning Tips for Efficient Learning will help you to get started. try to at least find a knowledgeable friend to buddy up to ensure that you’re on the right track.

I’ve used this technique for years and I can definitely testify to its effectiveness. Here are the key steps of Spaced Repetition: — Within 24 hours of your initial intake of information write down notes and then review them. During the reviewing session but then look away and try to recall the most important points. Recall the Information for the First Time try to recall the information with minimal reading of your notes. You might also want to try recalling the information when you’re taking a walk or sitting down and relaxing. recall the information every 24-36 hours over the course of several days. These don’t have to be lengthy recalls instead you could do it while standing in a queue for a latte or when walking your dog. You are still free to look at your notes but you should only do this if absolutely necessary. — After several days have passed since you first tried to learn the information take out your material and study it all over again. This will allow your brain to reprocess concepts and will cement the information into your mind.

This is also the stage that learners typically ignore or do ineffectively. – This is the stage where you analyze how well you performed and make adjustments to improve and practice/apply again. Let’s look at a handful of these supplements now. There are two types of Omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA. These can be found in fish oil supplements (vegans can choose algae oil as an alternative). DHA and EPA help maintain the health of brain cells as well as reducing brain inflammation and improving brain cell growth. Memory reaction time and problem solving skills are all increased by taking a supplement containing abundant DHA and EPA. as L-Tyrosine is very bioavailable (highly absorbent in the body) only a tiny amount is needed to produce a strong effect. Another amino acid for you to consider is Acetyl-L-carnitine. Research has shown that people taking an Acetyl-L-carnitine supplement had increased focus and alertness. It can also help treat mild dementia or Alzheimer’s. Benefits of taking this herb include and a boost to memory power. One scientific study found that it could also benefit age-related cognitive decline symptoms in older populations. there are some tried-and-tested techniques for speeding up both your reading and comprehension. Check out these techniques for starters: Consider this: The average reading speed is similar to the average talking speed (around 300 words per minute). That’s because most people are in the habit of saying the words aloud in their head as they read. So you must break this habit. You can do this by coming to the realization that you don’t need to say every word in your head in order to understand what you are reading. Try it and see. You’ll find that your brain still processes all the information it receives and you’ll be able to read significantly faster than before. This will give you a good overall feel for the material and will mean that you’ll be mentally prepared to read learn and remember the content. You’ll also find that you can read through the material quicker than you would otherwise. When you commit to reading regularly (perhaps a book a month) then you’ll naturally find that your reading and comprehension skills improve. You’ll also enjoy reading and learning much more than before! The above is just a taster of some of the techniques that you can easily adopt to boost your reading speed.

Examples of binary files are files opened in binary mode ( for a file object able to read and write objects.  Bytes-like objects can

compression saving to a binary file and sending over a socket. Some operations need the binary data to be mutable.  The documentation
often refers to these as “read-write bytes-like objects”.  Example
mutable buffer objects include .
Other operations require the binary data to be stored in
immutable objects (“read-only bytes-like objects”); examples
of these include Python source code is compiled into bytecode the internal representation
of a Python program in the CPython interpreter.  The bytecode is also
cached in files so that executing the same file is

avoided).  This “intermediate language” is said to run on a that executes the machine code corresponding to
each bytecode. Do note that bytecodes are not expected to work between

See A buffer is considered contiguous exactly if it is either .  Zero-dimensional buffers are
C and Fortran contiguous.  In one-dimensional arrays the items

substitution.  Duck-typing avoids tests using that duck-typing can be complemented
with Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.  This common Python coding

performs garbage collection via reference counting and a cyclic garbage
collector that is able to detect and break reference cycles.  The
garbage collector can be controlled using the .  It looks like a

only one thread executes Python at a time.
This simplifies the CPython implementation by making the object model

safe against concurrent access.  Locking the entire interpreter
makes it easier for the interpreter to be multi-threaded at the
expense of much of the parallelism afforded by multi-processor
machines. are designed so as to release the GIL when doing computationally-intensive
tasks such as compression or hashing.  Also the GIL is always released
when doing I/O. Past efforts to create a “free-threaded” interpreter (one which locks
shared data at a much finer granularity) have not been successful
because performance suffered in the common single-processor case. It
is believed that overcoming this performance issue would make the
implementation much more complicated and therefore costlier to maintain. A bytecode cache file that uses the hash rather than the last-modified
time of the corresponding source file to determine its validity. See if it has a hash value which never changes during
its lifetime (it needs a and can be compared to
other objects (it needs an method).  Hashable objects which
compare equal must have the same hash value. Hashability makes an object usable as a dictionary key and a set member because these data structures use the hash value internally. Most of Python’s immutable built-in objects are hashable; mutable
containers (such as lists or dictionaries) are not; immutable
containers (such as tuples and frozensets) are only hashable if
their elements are hashable.  Objects which are
instances of user-defined classes are hashable by default.  They all
compare unequal (except with themselves) and their hash value is derived
from their An Integrated Development Environment for Python.  IDLE is a basic editor
and interpreter environment which ships with the standard distribution of
Python. An object with a fixed value.  Immutable objects include numbers strings and
tuples.  Such an object cannot be altered.  A new object has to
be created if a different value has to be stored.  They play an important
role in places where a constant hash value is needed for example as a key
in a dictionary. this list of locations usually comes from but
for subpackages it may also come from the parent package’s The process by which Python code in one module is made available to
Python code in another module. An object that both finds and loads a module; both a Python has an interactive interpreter which means you can enter
statements and expressions at the interpreter prompt immediately
execute them and see their results.  Just launch with no
arguments (possibly by selecting it from your computer’s main
menu). It is a very powerful way to test out new ideas or inspect
modules and packages (remember as opposed to a compiled one though the distinction can be blurry because of the presence of the
bytecode compiler.  This means that source files can be run directly
without explicitly creating an executable which is then run.
Interpreted languages typically have a shorter development/debug cycle
than compiled ones though their programs generally also run more
slowly.  See also the Python interpreter enters a special phase
where it gradually releases all allocated resources such as modules
and various critical internal structures.  It also makes several calls
to the . This can trigger
the execution of code in user-defined destructors or weakref callbacks.
Code executed during the shutdown phase can encounter various
exceptions as the resources it relies on may not function anymore
(common examples are library modules or the warnings machinery). The main reason for interpreter shutdown is that the module
or the script being run has finished executing. An object capable of returning its members one at a time. Examples of
iterables include all sequence types (such as ) and some non-sequence types like and objects of any classes you define
with an loop and in many other places where a sequence is
needed ( …).  When an iterable object is passed
as an argument to the built-in function it returns an
iterator for the object.  This iterator is good for one pass over the set
of values.  When using iterables it is usually not necessary to call or deal with iterator objects yourself.  The An object representing a stream of data.  Repeated calls to the iterator’s method (or passing it to the built-in function ) return successive items in the stream.  When no more data
are available a exception is raised instead.  At this
point the iterator object is exhausted and any further calls to its again.  Iterators
are required to have an method that returns the iterator
object itself so every iterator is also iterable and may be used in most
places where other iterables are accepted.  One notable exception is code
which attempts multiple iteration passes.  A container object (such as a ) produces a fresh new iterator each time you pass it to the function or use it in a loop.  Attempting this
with an iterator will just return the same exhausted iterator object used
in the previous iteration pass making it appear like an empty container. More information can be found in A key function or collation function is a callable that returns a value
used for sorting or ordering.  For example is
used to produce a sort key that is aware of locale specific sort
conventions. A number of tools in Python accept key functions to control how elements
are ordered or grouped.  They include There are several ways to create a key function.  For example. the method can serve as a key function for case insensitive
sorts.  Alternatively a key function can be built from a module provides three key function constructors: for examples of how to create and use key functions. An anonymous inline function consisting of a single Look before you leap.  This coding style explicitly tests for
pre-conditions before making calls or lookups.  This style contrasts with
the approach and is characterized by the presence of many the LBYL approach can risk introducing a
race condition between “the looking” and “the leaping”.  For example but before the lookup.
This issue can be solved with locks or by using the EAFP approach. .  Despite its name it is more akin
to an array in other languages than to a linked list since access to
elements is O(1). A compact way to process all or part of the elements in a sequence and

finders are related to for the methods that meta path
finders implement. The class of a class.  Class definitions create a class name and a list of base classes.  The metaclass is responsible for
taking those three arguments and creating the class.  Most object oriented
programming languages provide a default implementation.  What makes Python
special is that it is possible to create custom metaclasses.  Most users
never need this tool but when the need arises elegant solutions.  They have been used for logging attribute
access More information can be found in A function which is defined inside a class body.  If called as an attribute
of an instance of that class the method will get the instance object as
its first Method Resolution Order is the order in which base classes are searched
for a member during lookup. See The Python 2.3 Method Resolution Order for details of the
algorithm used by the Python interpreter since the 2.3 release. An object that serves as an organizational unit of Python code.  Modules
have a namespace containing arbitrary Python objects.  Modules are loaded
into Python by the process of A namespace containing the import-related information used to load a
module. An instance of Mutable objects can change their value but keep their The term “named tuple” applies to any type or class that inherits from
tuple and whose indexable elements are also accessible using named
attributes.  The type or class may have other features as well. Several built-in types are named tuples Some named tuples are built-in types (such as the above examples).
Alternatively a named tuple can be created from a regular class
definition that inherits from and that defines named
fields.  Such a class can be written by hand or it can be created with
the factory function .  The latter
technique also adds some extra methods that may not be found in
hand-written or built-in named tuples. The place where a variable is stored.  Namespaces are implemented as
dictionaries.  There are the local global and built-in namespaces as well
as nested namespaces in objects (in methods).  Namespaces support
modularity by preventing naming conflicts.  For instance are distinguished by
their namespaces.  Namespaces also aid readability and maintainability by
making it clear which module implements a function.  For instance makes it clear that those
functions are implemented by the which serves only as a container for
subpackages.  Namespace packages may have no physical representation and specifically are not like a The ability to refer to a variable in an enclosing definition.  For
instance a function defined inside another function can refer to
variables in the outer function.  Note that nested scopes by default work
only for reference and not for assignment.  Local variables both read and
write in the innermost scope.  Likewise global variables read and write
to the global namespace.  The Old name for the flavor of classes now used for all class objects.  In
earlier Python versions only new-style classes could use Python’s newer Any data with state (attributes or value) and defined behavior

by position. Positional-only parameters can be defined by including a character in the parameter list of the function definition after
them : specifies an argument that can be supplied only
by keyword.  Keyword-only parameters can be defined by including a
single var-positional parameter or bare in the parameter list
of the function definition before them : specifies that an arbitrary sequence of
positional arguments can be provided (in addition to any positional
arguments already accepted by other parameters).  Such a parameter can
be defined by prepending the parameter name with : specifies that arbitrarily many keyword arguments

providing information to the Python community or describing a new
feature for Python or its processes or environment. PEPs should
provide a concise technical specification and a rationale for proposed
features. PEPs are intended to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major new
features for collecting community input on an issue and for documenting
the design decisions that have gone into Python. The PEP author is
responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting
dissenting opinions. A set of files in a single directory (possibly stored in a zip file)
that contribute to a namespace package A provisional API is one which has been deliberately excluded from
the standard library’s backwards compatibility guarantees.  While major
changes to such interfaces are not expected as long as they are marked
provisional backwards incompatible changes (up to and including removal
of the interface) may occur if deemed necessary by core developers.  Such
changes will not be made gratuitously – they will occur only if serious
fundamental flaws are uncovered that were missed prior to the inclusion
of the API. backwards incompatible changes are seen as
a “solution of last resort” - every attempt will still be made to find
a backwards compatible resolution to any identified problems. This process allows the standard library to continue to evolve over
time without locking in problematic design errors for extended periods
of time.  See Nickname for the Python 3.x release line (coined long ago when the
release of version 3 was something in the distant future.)  This is also
abbreviated “Py3k”. An idea or piece of code which closely follows the most common idioms
of the Python language rather than implementing code using concepts
common to other languages.  For example a common idiom in Python is
to loop over all elements of an iterable using a A dotted name showing the “path” from a module’s global scope to a
class function or method defined in that module .  For top-level functions and classes the qualified name
is the same as the object’s name: When used to refer to modules means the
entire dotted path to the module The number of references to an object.  When the reference count of an
object drops to zero it is deallocated.  Reference counting is
generally not visible to Python code but it is a key element of the function that programmers can call to return the
reference count for a particular object. such as a directory containing an A declaration inside a class that saves memory by pre-declaring space for
instance attributes and eliminating instance dictionaries.  Though
popular the technique is somewhat tricky to get right and is best
reserved for rare cases where there are large numbers of instances in a
memory-critical application. which supports efficient element access using integer
indices via the method that returns the length of the sequence.
Some built-in sequence types are but is considered a
mapping rather than a sequence because the lookups use arbitrary abstract base class
defines a much richer interface that goes beyond just . Types that implement this expanded
interface can be registered explicitly using A compact way to process all or part of the elements in an iterable and
return a set with the results. dispatch where the implementation is
chosen based on the type of a single argument. An object usually containing a portion of a .  A slice is
created using the subscript notation with colons between numbers
when several are given .  The bracket
(subscript) notation uses A method that is called implicitly by Python to execute a certain
operation on a type such as addition.  Such methods have names starting
and ending with double underscores.  Special methods are documented in A statement is part of a suite (a “block” of code).  A statement is either
an or one of several constructs with a keyword A codec which encodes Unicode strings to bytes. a text file actually accesses a byte-oriented datastream
and handles the automatically.
Examples of text files are files opened in text mode ( for a file object able to read and write A string which is bound by three instances of either a quotation mark
(“) or an apostrophe (‘).  While they don’t provide any functionality
not available with single-quoted strings they are useful for a number
of reasons.  They allow you to include unescaped single and double
quotes within a string and they can span multiple lines without the
use of the continuation character making them especially useful when
writing docstrings. The type of a Python object determines what kind of object it is; every
object has a type.  An object’s type is accessible as its attribute or can be retrieved with created by assigning the type to an identifier. Type aliases are useful for simplifying could be made more readable like this: that specifies the expected type for a variable or a function parameter or return value. Type hints are optional and are not enforced by Python but
they are useful to static type analysis tools and aid IDEs with code
completion and refactoring. A manner of interpreting text streams in which all of the following are

The answer to this is simple we can have all the above things only if we have performance. So performance is like currency through which we can buy all the above things. Another reason for studying performance is – speed is fun! performance == scale. Imagine a text editor that can load 1000 pages but can spell check 1 page per minute OR an image editor that takes 1 hour to rotate your image 90 degrees left OR … you get it. If a software feature can not cope with the scale of tasks users need to perform – it is as good as dead. Given two algorithms for a task how do we find out which one is better? One naive way of doing this is – implement both the algorithms and run the two programs on your computer for different inputs and see which one takes less time. There are many problems with this approach for analysis of algorithms. 1) It might be possible that for some inputs first algorithm performs better than the second. And for some inputs second performs better. 2) It might also be possible that for some inputs first algorithm perform better on one machine and the second works better on other machine for some other inputs. is the big idea that handles above issues in analyzing algorithms. In Asymptotic Analysis we evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of input size (we don’t measure the actual running time). We calculate how the time (or space) taken by an algorithm increases with the input size. let us consider the search problem (searching a given item) in a sorted array. One way to search is Linear Search (order of growth is linear) and the other way is Binary Search (order of growth is logarithmic). To understand how Asymptotic Analysis solves the above mentioned problems in analyzing algorithms let us say we run the Linear Search on a fast computer and Binary Search on a slow computer and we pick the constant values for the two computers so that it tells us exactly how long it takes for the given machine to perform the search in seconds. Let’s say the constant for is 0.2 and the constant for is 1000 which means that A is 5000 times more powerful than B. For small values of input array size n the fast computer may take less time. But after a certain value of input array size the Binary Search will definitely start taking less time compared to the Linear Search even though the Binary Search is being run on a slow machine. The reason is the order of growth of Binary Search with respect to input size is logarithmic while the order of growth of Linear Search is linear. So the machine dependent constants can always be ignored after a certain value of input size. Here are some running times for this example: Linear Search running time in seconds on A Binary Search running time in seconds on B ------------------------------------------------
|n      | Running time on A | Running time on B |
-------------------------------------------------
|10     | 2 sec             | ~ 1 h             |
-------------------------------------------------
|100    | 20 sec            | ~ 1.8 h           |
-------------------------------------------------
|10^6   | ~ 55.5 h          | ~ 5.5 h           |
-------------------------------------------------
|10^9   | ~ 6.3 years       | ~ 8.3 h           |
------------------------------------------------- but that’s the best way available for analyzing algorithms. For example say there are two sorting algorithms that take 1000nLogn and 2nLogn time respectively on a machine. Both of these algorithms are asymptotically same (order of growth is nLogn). So we can’t judge which one is better as we ignore constants in Asymptotic Analysis. we always talk about input sizes larger than a constant value. It might be possible that those large inputs are never given to your software and an algorithm which is asymptotically slower always performs better for your particular situation. So you may end up choosing an algorithm that is Asymptotically slower but faster for your software.

Python Program to Check Prime Number Example to check whether an integer is a prime number or not using for loop and if...else statement. If the number is not prime it's explained in output why it is not a prime number. you should have the knowledge of the following A positive integer greater than 1 which has no other factors except 1 and the number itself is called a prime number. 2 7 etc. are prime numbers as they do not have any other factors. But 6 is not prime (it is composite) since Example 1: Using a flag variable # Program to check if a number is prime or not

num = 29

# To take input from the user
#num = int(input(""Enter a number: ""))

# define a flag variable
flag = False

# prime numbers are greater than 1
if num > 1:
    # check for factors
    for i in range(2 num):
        if (num % i) == 0:

# check if flag is True
if flag:
    print(num ""is not a prime number"")
else:
    print(num is prime or not. Numbers less than or equal to 1 are not prime numbers. Hence we only proceed if the is exactly divisible by any number from . If we find a factor in that range the number is not prime and break out of the loop. : We can improve our program by decreasing the range of numbers where we look for factors. our search range is from 2 to We could have used the range . The latter range is based on the fact that a composite number must have a factor less than the square root of that number. Otherwise You can change the value of variable in the above source code to check whether a number is prime or not for other integers. we can also use the statement to do this task without using an additional Example 2: Using a for...else statement # Program to check if a number is prime or not

num = 407

# To take input from the user
#num = int(input(""Enter a number: ""))

# prime numbers are greater than 1

11 times 37 is 407 It works on the logic that the loop runs if and only if we don't break out the loop.

Stress can be triggered by all kinds of things in life How to Cope with the 5 Common Stressors In Life and Feel Better the results are almost always the same — an intense and constant feeling of fatigue. A stressed person may also experience problems concentrating and sleeping. This is largely due to the effects stress have on physical and mental health. When put into a stressful situation your body adopts a physical response. This starts with your nervous system releasing hormones that prepare you to either respond via ‘fight or flight’. think back to the last time you were in a particularly stressful situation. I guarantee that you would have have noticed that your heartbeat and breathing sped up your muscles will have got tighter and your probably started to sweat. if the stress is short-term and temporary your body and mind will likely make a quick recovery. However if you’re exposed to constant stress over a long period of time (referred to as chronic stress) the constant release of the stress hormone cortisol can lead to serious health issues. Discover more stress triggers by reading our article 13 Things That Are Stressing You Out and Making You Less Productive Unmotivated people are typically either suffering from mental health issues such as anxiety or depression or they lack a clear life purpose which leads them to feeling dissatisfied and apathetic. Lack of motivation may also be caused by any of the following: Goals being too big or too small 7 Things That Cause Your Lack of Motivation (And How to Fix Them) If we fail to do this we can expect to see some or all of the folllowing negative consequences: Learn more about the importance of sleep and the sleep cycle in our article The Importance of Sleep Cycles on Productivity (+ Tips to Improve Yours) then you’re likely to be operating on depleted personal energy.

Let’s take a brief look at some of the common medical causes behind feeling tired all the time… this response would only last for a matter of hours or days but in the case of chronic fatigue the response lingers for weeks months or even years. This can lead to a number of health conditions If sleep apnea is not treated it can lead to complications such as: Hyperthyroidism is when your thyroid makes too much thyroid hormone causing your body to use energy too quickly. As well as making you feel tired it can also lead an increased heart rate and a feeling of nervousness. Hypothyroidism is the opposite. This is where your thyroid makes too little thyroid hormone. This also makes you feel tired it can lead to weight gain and an inability to tolerate cold temperatures. There are various reasons why people develop thyroid disease including the fact that it can be passed down through families.

I fall into the latter camp. My reason? I’ve noticed tangible health and energy benefits when I take regular supplements. While taking a good quality multivitamin/multimineral is a key element of effective supplementation there are also a number of other supplements that you can choose to take that will specifically boost your energy levels: As a recent study by Newcastle University shows Vitamin D is also vital for making our muscles work efficiently and for boosting our energy levels. you’ll feel stronger and naturally have more energy. coffee also has several other benefits beyond tasting good and giving your energy a boost. These include: Helping you stay focused and alert For the best daily energy boost without disrupting your sleep I recommend you consume about 400mg of caffeine in a morning. That’s around 2-3 espresso shots or five teaspoons of instant coffee. If you’re pregnant or breastfeeding then it’s recommended that you limit your caffeine intake to about 200mg per day. The secret to drinking coffee for energy is to make sure you only drink it in a morning. That’s because caffeine stays in the body for quite some time. Studies show that it leaves the body at a rate of about 11% per hour. This gives it a half life of about 6 hours. To put this in practical terms if you drink a cup of coffee with 100mg of caffeine at 10am you’ll still have about 50mg of caffeine remaining in your system at 4pm.

By doing this you’ll reduce your chance of injury and you’ll also find it easy to keep going and to eventually increase the amount and intensity of exercise you do. even if you don’t want to do high-intensity gym training it’s still incredibly beneficial to spend at least 20 minutes per day walking outside. Do this and you’ll quickly notice some definite physical and Before giving you some quick tips on improving your sleep let me first say a few words about sleep cycles. Sleep cycles consist of stages 1 3 and 4 and REM (rapid eye movement). Many people think that a typical sleep cycle consists of only one cycle through the stages our sleep does not progress through all of the stages in sequence. Our sleep starts with stage 1 and then moves into stages 2 3 and 4. After stage 4 deep sleep stages 3 and then 2 are repeated before going into REM Sleep. Once REM is complete we usually return to stage 2 sleep. 4-5 sleep cycles are optimal to get a good night’s sleep as each cycle takes around 90-120 minutes to complete. If anything disrupts our sleep cycle — like drinking coffee in an evening or staying up too late — then it means you won’t sleep properly and you’ll likely wake up feeling groggy and fatigued. you can do to ensure your sleep and sleep cycles are operating normally and naturally: that help you to sleep before going to bed Reduce blue light exposure in an evening Sleep and wake at consistent times – try one of these these to help you to do this.

The ESP-IDF GitHub repository is updated regularly especially the master branch where new development takes place. there are also stable releases available. The documentation for the current stable release version can always be found at this URL: Documentation for the latest version (master branch) can always be found at this URL: The full history of releases can be found on the GitHub repository . There you can find release notes links to each version of the documentation and instructions for obtaining each version. Another place to find documentation for all current releases is the documentation page where you can go to the upper-left corner and click the version dropdown (between the target dropdown and the search bar). You can also use this dropdown to switch between versions of the documentation. Documentation for older versions are also still available: Which Version Should I Start With? . Stable versions have been manually tested and are updated with “bugfix releases” which fix bugs without changing other functionality (see for more details). Every stable release version can be found on the experimentation or for developing new ESP-IDF features latest version (master branch in Git) . The latest version in the master branch has all the latest features and has passed automated testing but has not been completely manually tested (“bleeding edge”). If a required feature is not yet available in a stable release but you do not want to use the master branch it is possible to check out a pre-release version or a release branch. It is recommended to start from a stable version and then follow the instructions for if you already have a local copy of ESP-IDF and wish to update it. add new functionality and may change functionality. This includes removing deprecated functionality. If updating to a new major release (for example some of your project’s code may need updating and functionality may need to be re-tested. The release notes on the include lists of Breaking Changes to refer to. add new functionality and fix bugs but will not change or remove documented functionality or make incompatible changes to public APIs. If updating to a new minor release (for example your project’s code does not require updating but you should re-test your project. Pay particular attention to the items mentioned in the release notes on the only fix bugs and do not add new functionality. If updating to a new bugfix release (for example you do not need to change any code in your project and you only need to re-test the functionality directly related to bugs listed in the release notes on the Each ESP-IDF major and minor release version has an associated support period. After this period the release is End of Life and no longer supported. and describes how the support periods for each release are determined. includes information about the support period for that particular release. use the latest stable release. If you have a GitHub account click the “Watch” button in the top-right of the and choose “Releases only”. GitHub will notify you whenever a new release is available. Whenever a bug fix release is available for the version you are using plan to update to it. periodically update the project to a new major or minor ESP-IDF version (for example once a year.) The update process should be straightforward for Minor updates but may require some planning and checking of the release notes for Major updates. Always plan to update to a newer release before the release you are using becomes End of Life. Each ESP-IDF major and minor release (V4.1 etc) is supported for 30 months after the initial stable release date. Supported means that the ESP-IDF team will continue to apply bug fixes etc to the release branch on GitHub and periodically make new bugfix releases as needed. Support period is divided into “Service” and “Maintenance” period: bugfixes releases are more frequent. In some cases support for new features may be added during the Service period (this is reserved for features which are needed to meet particular regulatory requirements or standards for new products and which carry a very low risk of introducing regressions.) the version is still supported but only bugfixes for high severity issues or security issues will be applied. Using an “In Service” version is recommended when starting a new project. Users are encouraged to upgrade all projects to a newer ESP-IDF release before the support period finishes and the release becomes End of Life (EOL). It is our policy to not continue fixing bugs in End of Life releases. etc) are not covered by any support period. Sometimes a particular feature is marked as “Preview” in a release which means it is also not covered by the support period. The ESP-IDF Programming Guide has information about the The local ESP-IDF version can be checked by using idf.py: The ESP-IDF version is also compiled into the firmware and can be accessed (as a string) via the macro . The default ESP-IDF bootloader will print the version on boot (the version information is not always updated if the code in the GitHub repo is updated it only changes if there is a clean build or if that particular source file is recompiled). If writing code that needs to support multiple ESP-IDF versions the version can be checked at compile time using - in development for version 3.2. - number of commits after v3.2 development started. Beta version in development (on a - number of commits after the pre-release beta tag was assigned. means that there are modifications in the local ESP-IDF directory. The development (Git) workflow of the Espressif ESP-IDF team is as follows: New work is always added on the master branch (latest version) first. The ESP-IDF version on Changes are first added to an internal Git repository for code review and testing but are pushed to GitHub after automated testing passes. When a new version (developed on ) becomes feature complete and “beta” quality a new branch is made for the release . A pre-release tag is also created . You can see a full on GitHub. Beta pre-releases have release notes which may include a significant number of Known Issues. As testing of the beta version progresses bug fixes will be added to both the branch and the release branch. New features for the next release may start being added to Once testing is nearly complete a new release candidate is tagged on the release branch . This is still a pre-release version. If no more significant bugs are found or reported then the final Major or Minor Version is tagged . This version appears on the As bugs are reported in released versions the fixes will continue to be committed to the same release branch. Regular bugfix releases are made from the same release branch. After manual testing is complete a bugfix release is tagged (i.e. Updating ESP-IDF depends on which version(s) you wish to follow: is recommended for the latest features is a compromise between the first two. These guides assume that you already have a local copy of ESP-IDF cloned. To get one check Step 2 in the To update to a new ESP-IDF release (recommended for production use) this is the process to follow: When a bugfix release for the version you are using is released (for example check out the new bugfix version into the existing ESP-IDF directory: When major or minor updates are released check the Release Notes on the releases page and decide if you want to update or to stay with your current release. Updating is via the same Git commands shown above. If you installed the stable release via zip file instead of using git it might not be possible to update versions using the commands. In this case update by downloading a new zip file and replacing the entire a tag corresponding to a pre-release version or release candidate the process is the same as Pre-release tags are not always found on the on GitHub for a full list. Caveats for using a pre-release are similar to Using Master branch means living “on the bleeding edge” with the latest ESP-IDF code. To use the latest version on the ESP-IDF master branch this is the process to follow: Check out the master branch locally: cd $IDF_PATH
git checkout master
git pull
git submodule update --init --recursive to pull the latest version of master. Note that you may need to change your project or report bugs after updating your master branch. To switch from master to a release branch or stable version as shown in the other sections. It is strongly recommended to regularly run so a local copy of master does not get too old. Arbitrary old master branch revisions are effectively unsupportable “snapshots” that may have undocumented bugs. For a semi-stable version using a release branch is part-way between using the master branch and only using stable releases. A release branch is always beta quality or better and receives bug fixes before they appear in each stable release. to follow the branch for ESP-IDF v3.1 including any bugfixes for future releases like cd $IDF_PATH
git fetch
git checkout release/v3.1
git pull
git submodule update --init --recursive ESP-IDF will be updated with fixes for this release. There is no dedicated documentation for release branches. It is recommended to use the documentation for the closest version to the branch which is currently checked out. ",[],Yes,"history:0.05536308139562607,technology:0.05477742478251457",

In this post we will take an example of Linear Search and analyze it using Asymptotic analysis. We can have three cases to analyze an algorithm: Let us consider the following implementation of Linear Search. // C++ implementation of the approach // Linearly search x in arr[]. // If x is present then return the index (i = 0; i < n; i++) { "" is present at index "" // C implementation of the approach // Linearly search x in arr[]. // If x is present then return the index (i = 0; i < n; i++) { /* Driver program to test above functions*/ ""%d is present at index %d"" // Java implementation of the approach // Linearly search x in arr[].  If x is present then ; i < n; i++) { /* Driver program to test above functions*/ ""%d is present at index %d"" /*This code is contributed by PrinciRaj1992*/ # Python 3 implementation of the approach # Linearly search x in arr[]. If x is present // C# implementation of the approach // Linearly search x in arr[].  If x is present then (i = 0; i < n; i++) { /* Driver program to test above functions*/ "" is present at index "" /*This code is contributed by PrinciRaj1992*/ // PHP implementation of the approach // Linearly search x in arr[]. If x // is present then return the index "" is present at index "" 30 is present at index 2 we calculate upper bound on running time of an algorithm. We must know the case that causes maximum number of operations to be executed. For Linear Search the worst case happens when the element to be searched (x in the above code) is not present in the array. When x is not present the search() functions compares it with all the elements of arr[] one by one. Therefore the worst case time complexity of linear search would be Θ(n). we take all possible inputs and calculate computing time for all of the inputs. Sum all the calculated values and divide the sum by total number of inputs. We must know (or predict) distribution of cases. For the linear search problem let us assume that all cases are (including the case of x not being present in array). So we sum all the cases and divide the sum by (n+1). Following is the value of average case time complexity. we calculate lower bound on running time of an algorithm. We must know the case that causes minimum number of operations to be executed. In the linear search problem the best case occurs when x is present at the first location. The number of operations in the best case is constant (not dependent on n). So time complexity in the best case would be Θ(1) we do worst case analysis to analyze algorithms. In the worst analysis we guarantee an upper bound on the running time of an algorithm which is good information. The average case analysis is not easy to do in most of the practical cases and it is rarely done. In the average case analysis we must know (or predict) the mathematical distribution of all possible inputs. The Best Case analysis is bogus. Guaranteeing a lower bound on an algorithm doesn’t provide any information as in the worst case an algorithm may take years to run. all the cases are asymptotically same there are no worst and best cases. For example . Merge Sort does Θ(nLogn) operations in all cases. Most of the other sorting algorithms have worst and best cases. For example in the typical implementation of Quick Sort (where pivot is chosen as a corner element) the worst occurs when the input array is already sorted and the best occur when the pivot elements always divide array in two halves. For insertion sort the worst case occurs when the array is reverse sorted and the best case occurs when the array is sorted in the same order as output.

stability.  In order to maintain this reputation the developers would like to
know of any deficiencies you find in Python. It can be sometimes faster to fix bugs yourself and contribute patches to
Python as it streamlines the process and involves less people. Learn how to If you find a bug in this documentation or would like to propose an improvement please submit a bug report on the .  If you
have a suggestion on how to fix it you can also email documentation bug reports to (behavioral bugs can be sent to ).
‘docs@’ is a mailing list run by volunteers; your request will be noticed though it may take a while to be processed. A list of documentation bugs that have been submitted to the Python issue tracker. Overview of the process involved in reporting an improvement on the tracker. Comprehensive guide for individuals that are interested in contributing to Python documentation. Bug reports for Python itself should be submitted via the Python Bug Tracker
( ).  The bug tracker offers a Web form which allows
pertinent information to be entered and submitted to the developers. The first step in filing a report is to determine whether the problem has
already been reported.  The advantage in doing so aside from saving the
developers time is that you learn what has been done to fix it; it may be that
the problem has already been fixed for the next release or additional
information is needed (in which case you are welcome to provide it if you can!).
To do this search the bug database using the search box on the top of the page. If the problem you’re reporting is not already in the bug tracker go back to
the Python Bug Tracker and log in.  If you don’t already have a tracker account one of the OpenID provider
logos in the sidebar.  It is not possible to submit a bug report anonymously. you can submit a bug.  Select the “Create New” link in the
sidebar to open the bug reporting form. The submission form has a number of fields.  For the “Title” field short description of the problem; less than ten words is good.  In the
“Type” field select the type of your problem; also select the “Component” and
“Versions” to which the bug relates. describe the problem in detail including what you
expected to happen and what did happen.  Be sure to include whether any
extension modules were involved and what hardware and software platform you
were using (including version information as appropriate). Each bug report will be assigned to a developer who will determine what needs to
be done to correct the problem.  You will receive an update each time action is
taken on the bug. Article which goes into some detail about how to create a useful bug report.

Machine Learning is a step into the direction of artificial intelligence (AI). Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the 
outcome. In this tutorial we will go back to mathematics and study statistics and how to calculate 
important numbers based on data sets. We will also learn how to use various Python modules to get the answers we 
need. And we will learn how to make functions that are able to predict the outcome 
based on what we have learned. In the mind of a computer a data set is any collection of data.
It can be anything from an array to a complete database. we can guess that the average value is probably around 80 
or 90 and we are also able to determine the highest value and the lowest value but what else can we do? And by looking at the database we can see that the most popular color is white and the oldest car is 17 years but what if we could predict if a car had an AutoPass just by looking at the other values? That is what Machine Learning is for! Analyzing data and predicting the outcome! In Machine Learning it is common to work with very large data sets. In this 
  tutorial we will try to make it as easy as possible to understand the 
  different concepts of machine learning and we will work with small 
  easy-to-understand data sets. it is important to know what type of data we are dealing with. We can split the data types into three main categories: and can be split into two 
numerical categories: - numbers that are limited to integers. Example: The number 
of cars passing by. - numbers that are of infinite value. Example: The 
  price of an item or the size of an item data are values that cannot be measured up 
against each other. Example: a color value but can be measured 
up against each other. Example: school grades where A is better than B and so 
on. By knowing the data type of your data source you will be able to know what 
technique to use when analyzing them. You will learn more about statistics and analyzing data in the next chapters.

The main idea of asymptotic analysis is to have a measure of the efficiency of algorithms that don’t depend on machine-specific constants and doesn’t require algorithms to be implemented and time taken by programs to be compared. Asymptotic notations are mathematical tools to represent the time complexity of algorithms for asymptotic analysis. The following 3 asymptotic notations are mostly used to represent the time complexity of algorithms. The theta notation bounds a function from above and below so it defines exact asymptotic behavior. A simple way to get Theta notation of an expression is to drop low order terms and ignore leading constants. For example Dropping lower order terms is always fine because there will always be a number(n) after which Θ(n ) has higher values than Θ(n ) irrespective of the constants involved. we denote Θ(g(n)) is following set of functions. Θ(g(n)) = {f(n): there exist positive constants c1 c2 and n0 such 
                 that 0 <= c1*g(n) <= f(n) <= c2*g(n) for all n >= n0} if f(n) is theta of g(n) then the value f(n) is always between c1*g(n) and c2*g(n) for large values of n (n >= n0). The definition of theta also requires that f(n) must be non-negative for values of n greater than n0. The Big O notation defines an upper bound of an algorithm it bounds a function only from above. For example consider the case of Insertion Sort. It takes linear time in best case and quadratic time in worst case. We can safely say that the time complexity of Insertion sort is O(n^2). Note that O(n^2) also covers linear time. If we use Θ notation to represent time complexity of Insertion sort we have to use two statements for best and worst cases: 1. The worst case time complexity of Insertion Sort is Θ(n^2). 2. The best case time complexity of Insertion Sort is Θ(n). The Big O notation is useful when we only have upper bound on time complexity of an algorithm. Many times we easily find an upper bound by simply looking at the algorithm. O(g(n)) = { f(n): there exist positive constants c and 
                  n0 such that 0 <= f(n) <= c*g(n) for 
                  all n >= n0} Just as Big O notation provides an asymptotic upper bound on a function Ω notation provides an asymptotic lower bound. Ω Notation can be useful when we have lower bound on time complexity of an algorithm. As discussed in the previous post best case performance of an algorithm is generally not useful the Omega notation is the least used notation among all three. we denote by Ω(g(n)) the set of functions. Ω (g(n)) = {f(n): there exist positive constants c and
                  n0 such that 0 <= c*g(n) <= f(n) for
                  all n >= n0}. Let us consider the same Insertion sort example here. The time complexity of Insertion Sort can be written as Ω(n) but it is not a very useful information about insertion sort as we are generally interested in worst case and sometimes in average case. As we have gone through the definition of this three notations let’s now discuss some important properties of those notations. If f(n) is O(g(n)) then a*f(n) is also O(g(n)) ; where a is a constant. Example: f(n) = 2n²+5 is O(n²) then 7*f(n) = 7(2n²+5) = 14n²+35 is also O(n²) . Similarly this property satisfies for both Θ and Ω notation. If f(n) is Θ(g(n)) then a*f(n) is also Θ(g(n)) ; where a is a constant. If f(n) is Ω (g(n)) then a*f(n) is also Ω (g(n)) ; where a is a constant. If f(n) is O(g(n)) and g(n) is O(h(n)) then f(n) = O(h(n)) . g(n) = n² and h(n)=n³ n is O(n²) and n² is O(n³) Similarly this property satisfies for both Θ and Ω notation. If f(n) is Θ(g(n)) and g(n) is Θ(h(n)) then f(n) = Θ(h(n)) . If f(n) is Ω (g(n)) and g(n) is Ω (h(n)) then f(n) = Ω (h(n)) Reflexive properties are always easy to understand after transitive. If f(n) is given then f(n) is O(f(n)). Since MAXIMUM VALUE OF f(n) will be f(n) ITSELF ! Hence x = f(n) and y = O(f(n) tie themselves in reflexive relation always. f(n) = n² ; O(n²) i.e O(f(n)) Similarly this property satisfies for both Θ and Ω notation. If f(n) is given then f(n) is Θ(f(n)). If f(n) is given then f(n) is Ω (f(n)). If f(n) is Θ(g(n)) then g(n) is Θ(f(n)) . Example: f(n) = n² and g(n) = n² then f(n) = Θ(n²) and g(n) = Θ(n²) This property only satisfies for Θ notation. If f(n) is O(g(n)) then g(n) is Ω (f(n)). then n is O(n²) and n² is Ω (n) This property only satisfies for O and Ω notations 1.) If f(n) = O(g(n)) and f(n) = Ω(g(n)) then f(n) = Θ(g(n)) 2.) If f(n) = O(g(n)) and d(n)=O(e(n)) then f(n) + d(n) = O( max( g(n) then f(n) + d(n) = n + n² i.e O(n²) then f(n) * d(n) = O( g(n) * e(n) ) then f(n) * d(n) = n * n² = n³ i.e O(n³) Which of the following statements is/are valid? Time Complexity of QuickSort is Θ(n^2) Time Complexity of QuickSort is O(n^2) For any two functions f(n) and g(n) we have f(n) = Θ(g(n)) if and only if f(n) = O(g(n)) and f(n) = Ω(g(n)). Time complexity of all computer algorithms can be written as Ω(1) There are two more notations called .

We have already discussed Big-Ο is used as a tight upper-bound on the growth of an algorithm’s effort (this effort is described by the function f(n)) it can also be a loose upper-bound. “Little-ο” (ο()) notation is used to describe an upper-bound that cannot be tight. Let f(n) and g(n) be functions that map positive integers to positive real numbers. We say that f(n) is ο(g(n)) (or f(n) Ε ο(g(n))) if for there exists an integer constant n0 ≥ 1 such that 0 ≤ f(n) < c*g(n). of f(n). Little o is a rough estimate of the maximum order of growth whereas Big-Ο may be the actual order of growth. Is 7n + 8 &in o(n In order for that to be true we have to be able to find an n0 that makes f(n) < c * g(n) asymptotically true. we check the inequality is clearly true. If c = 1/100 but we’ll be able to find an n0. (Try n0 = 1000.) From the conjecture appears to be correct. lim  f(n)/g(n) = lim  (7n + 8)/(n ) = lim  7/2n = 0 (l’hospital) hence 7n + 8 &in o(n Let f(n) and g(n) be functions that map positive integers to positive real numbers. We say that f(n) is ω(g(n)) (or f(n) &in ω(g(n))) if for any real constant c > 0 there exists an integer constant n0 ≥ 1 such that f(n) > c * g(n) ≥ 0 for every integer n ≥ n0. f(n) has a higher growth rate than g(n) so main difference between Big Omega (Ω) and little omega (ω) lies in their definitions.In the case of Big Omega f(n)=Ω(g(n)) and the bound is 0<=cg(n)<=f(n) but in case of little omega it is true for 0<=c*g(n)<f(n). The relationship between Big Omega (Ω) and Little Omega (ω) is similar to that of Big-Ο and Little o except that now we are looking at the lower bounds. Little Omega (ω) is a rough estimate of the order of the growth whereas Big Omega (Ω) may represent exact order of growth. We use ω notation to denote a lower bound that is not asymptotically tight. f(n) &in ω(g(n)) if and only if g(n) &in ο((f(n)). Prove that 4n + 6 &in ω(1); the little omega(ο) running time can be proven by applying limit formula given below. if lim  f(n)/g(n) = ∞ then functions f(n) is ω(g(n)) we have functions f(n)=4n+6 and g(n)=1 also for any c we can get n0 for this inequality 0 <= c*g(n) < f(n) 0 <= c*1 < 4n+6 .

Top 50 Array Coding Problems for Interviews The Lower and Upper Bound Theory provides a way to find the lowest complexity algorithm to solve a problem. Before understanding the theory first lets have a brief look on what actually Lower and Upper bounds are. Let L(n) be the running time of an algorithm A(say) of A if there exist two constants C and N such that L(n) >= C*g(n) for n > N. Lower bound of an algorithm is shown by the asymptotic notation called Let U(n) be the running time of an algorithm A(say) of A if there exist two constants C and N such that U(n) <= C*g(n) for n > N. Upper bound of an algorithm is shown by the asymptotic notation called According to the lower bound theory for a lower bound L(n) of an algorithm it is not possible to have any other algorithm (for a common problem) whose time complexity is less than L(n) for random input. Also every algorithm must take at least L(n) time in worst case. that L(n) here is the minimum of all the possible algorithm The Lower Bound is a very important for any algorithm. Once we calculated it then we can compare it with the actual complexity of the algorithm and if their order are same then we can declare our algorithm as optimal. So in this section we will be discussing about techniques for finding the lower bound of an algorithm. that our main motive is to get an optimal algorithm which is the one having its Upper Bound Same as its Lower Bound (U(n)=L(n)). is a common example of an optimal algorithm. It is the easiest method to find the lower bound. The Lower bounds which can be easily observed on the basis of the number of input taken and the number of output produces are called Trivial Lower Bound. Multiplication of n x n matrix : For 2 matrix we will have 2n : 1 matrix of order n x n In the above example its easily predictable that the lower bound is O(n The method is for all those algorithms that are comparison based. For example in sorting we have to compare the elements of the list among themselves and then sort them accordingly. Similar is the case with searching and thus we can implement the same in this case. Now we will look at some examples to understand its usage. It is a type of searching in which the list is already sorted. In linear search we compare the key with first element if it does not match we compare with second element and so on till we check against the nth element. Else we will end up with a failure. we check the middle element against the key if it is greater we search the first half else we check the second half and repeat the same process. The diagram below there is an illustration of binary search in an array consisting of 4 elements The max no of comparisons are n. Let there be k levels in the tree. No. of nodes will be 2 The upper bound of no of nodes in any comparison based search of an element in list of size n will be n as there are maximum of n comparisons in worst case scenario 2 Each level will take 1 comparison thus no. of comparisons k≥|log Thus the lower bound of any comparison based search from a list of n elements cannot be less than log(n). Therefore we can say that Binary Search is optimal as its complexity is Θ(log n). The diagram below is an example of tree formed in sorting combinations with 3 elements. finding lower bound using computation model. For n elements we have a total on n! combinations (leaf nodes). (Refer the diagram the total combinations are 3! or 6) also it is clear that the tree formed is a binary tree. Each level in the diagram indicates a comparison. Let there be k levels => 2 is the total number of leaf nodes in a full binary tree thus in this case we have n!≤2 As the k in the above example is the no of comparisons thus by computational model lower bond = k. Using Lower bond theory to solve the algebraic problem: The type of programs build without any loops or control structures is called Straight Line Program. For example //no loops and no control structures Problems related to algebra like solving equations inequalities etc. comes under algebraic problems. For example Complexity for solving here is 4 (excluding the returning). The above example shows us a simple way to solve an equation for 2 degree polynomial i.e. degree polynomial we will have complexity of O(n Let us demonstrate via an algorithm. is a polynomial of degree n. //loop within a loop from 0 to n Loop within a loop => complexity = O(n Now to find an optimal algorithm we need to find the lower bound here (as per lower bound theory). As per Lower Bound Theory The optimal algorithm to solve the above problem is the one having complexity O(n). Lets prove this theorem using lower bounds. To prove that optimal algo of solving a n degree polynomial is O(n) The best solution for reducing the algo is to make this problem less complex by dividing the polynomial into several straight line problems. the complexity of this code is O(n). This way of solving such equations is called Horner’s method. Here is where lower bound theory works and give the optimum algorithm’s complexity as O(n). According to the upper bound theory for an upper bound U(n) of an algorithm we can always solve the problem in at most U(n) time.Time taken by a known algorithm to solve a problem with worse case input gives us the upper bound.

In this post analysis of iterative programs with simple examples is discussed. Time complexity of a function (or set of statements) is considered as O(1) if it doesn’t contain loop recursion and call to any other non-constant time function. // set of non-recursive and non-loop statements A loop or recursion that runs a constant number of times is also considered as O(1). For example the following loop is O(1). // Here c is a constant   
   for (int i = 1; i <= c; i++) {  
        // some O(1) expressions
   } Time Complexity of a loop is considered as O(n) if the loop variables is incremented / decremented by a constant amount. For example following functions have O(n) time complexity. // Here c is a positive integer constant   
   for (int i = 1; i <= n; i += c) {  
        // some O(1) expressions
   }

   for (int i = n; i > 0; i -= c) {
        // some O(1) expressions
   } : Time complexity of nested loops is equal to the number of times the innermost statement is executed. For example the following sample loops have O(n for (int i = 1; i <=n; i += c) {
       for (int j = 1; j <=n; j += c) {
          // some O(1) expressions
       }
   }

   for (int i = n; i > 0; i -= c) {
       for (int j = i+1; j <=n; j += c) {
          // some O(1) expressions
   } Time Complexity of a loop is considered as O(Logn) if the loop variables is divided / multiplied by a constant amount. for (int i = 1; i <=n; i *= c) {
       // some O(1) expressions
   }
   for (int i = n; i > 0; i /= c) {
       // some O(1) expressions
   } has O(Logn) time complexity. Let us see mathematically how it is O(Log n). The series that we get in first loop is 1 . If we put k equals to Log Time Complexity of a loop is considered as O(LogLogn) if the loop variables is reduced / increased exponentially by a constant amount. // Here c is a constant greater than 1   
   for (int i = 2; i <=n; i = pow(i c)) { 
       // some O(1) expressions
   }
   //Here fun is sqrt or cuberoot or any other constant root
   for (int i = n; i > 1; i = fun(i)) { 
       // some O(1) expressions
   } How to combine time complexities of consecutive loops? we calculate time complexity as sum of time complexities of individual loops. for (int i = 1; i <=m; i += c) {  
        // some O(1) expressions
   }
   for (int i = 1; i <=n; i += c) {
        // some O(1) expressions
   }
   Time complexity of above code is O(m) + O(n) which is O(m+n)
   If m == n the time complexity becomes O(2n) which is O(n). How to calculate time complexity when there are many if worst case time complexity is the most useful among best average and worst. Therefore we need to consider worst case. We evaluate the situation when values in if-else conditions cause maximum number of statements to be executed. where we consider the case when element is present at the end or not present at all. When the code is too complex to consider all if-else cases we can get an upper bound by ignoring if else and other complex control statements. How to calculate time complexity of recursive functions? Time complexity of a recursive function can be written as a mathematical recurrence relation. To calculate time complexity we must know how to solve recurrences. We will soon be discussing recurrence solving techniques as a separate post.

1620760918.82988,49867905,https://hackaday.com/blog/,Cross-section of a 35mm top hat DIN rail. One of the great things about the Internet is it lets people find out what other people are doing even if they normally wouldn’t have much exposure to each other. For example in some businesses DIN rails are a part of everyday life. But for a long time they were not very common in hobby electronics. Although rails are cheap boxes for rails aren’t always easy or cheap to obtain but 3D printing offers a solution for that. So while the industrial world has been using these handy rails for decades we are starting to see hobby projects incorporate them more often and people like [Makers Mashup] are discovering them and finding ways to and demonstrating them in this video If you haven’t encountered them yet DIN rails are a strip of metal bent into a particular shape with the purpose of mounting equipment like circuit breakers. A typical rail is 35 mm wide and has a hat-like cross-section which leads to the name “top hat” rail. A 25 mm channel lets you hide wiring and the surface has holes to allow you to mount the rail to a wall or a cabinet. These are sometimes called type O or type Ω rails or sections. too. A C-rail is shaped like a letter C and you can guess what a G section looks like too. Rails do come in different heights but the 35 mm is overwhelmingly common. However there are 15 mm rails and 75 mm rails You might think that particle physicists would be sad when an experiment comes up with different results than their theory would predict but nothing brightens up a field like unexplained phenomena.  Indeed particle physicists have been feverishly looking for deviations from the Standard Model. This year there have been tantalizing signs that a long unresolved discrepancy between theory and experiment will be confirmed by new experimental results. the quest to measure the magnetic moment of muons started more than 60 years ago and this has been measured ever more precisely since. From an experiment in 1959 at CERN in Switzerland to the turn of the century at Brookhaven to this year’s result at Fermilab the magnetic moment of the muon seems to be at odds with theoretical predictions. Although a statistical fluke is basically excluded this value also relies on complex theoretical calculations that are not all in agreement. Instead of heralding a new era of physics it might just be another headline too good to be true. But some physicists are mumbling “new particle” in hushed tones. Let’s see what all the fuss is about. Desiccant is common in 3D printing because the drier plastic filament is the better it prints. Beads of silica gel are great for controlling humidity but finding a porous container for them that is a convenient size is a little harder. 3D printing is a generally useful solution for custom containers but suffers from a slight drawback in this case: printing dense grills or hole patterns is not very efficient for filament-based printers. Dense hole patterns means lots of stopping and starting for the extruder which means a lot of filament retractions and longer print times in general. The green model is used as a modifier to the orange container (of which only the corners are left visible here) [The_Redcoat]’s solution to this is to avoid hole patterns or grills altogether print large wall sections of the container as infill-only with no perimeter layers at all . The exposed infill pattern is dense enough to prevent small beads of desiccant from falling through while allowing ample airflow at the same time. The big advantage here is that infill patterns are also quite efficient for the printer to lay down. Instead of the loads of stops and starts and retractions needed to print a network of holes infill patterns are mostly extruded in layers of unbroken lines. This translates to faster print speeds and an overall more reliable outcome even on printers that might not be as well tuned or calibrated as they could be. to create a stack of segments to use as a modifier in PrusaSlicer. The container is printed as normal except where it intersects with the modifier in which case those areas get printed with infill only and no walls. The result is what you see here: enough airflow for the desiccant to do its job while not allowing any of the beads to escape. It’s a clever use of both a high infill as well as the ability to use a 3D model as a slicing modifier. There’s also another approach to avoiding having to print a dense pattern of holes though it is for light-duty applications only: embedding a material like tulle into a 3D print can make a pretty great fan filter The Russian Woodpecker: Official Bird Of The Cold War Nests In Giant Antenna as Americans celebrated the country’s bicentennial with beer and bottle rockets a strong signal began disrupting shortwave and telecommunications signals all over the world. The signal was a rapid 10 Hz tapping that sounded like a woodpecker or a helicopter thup-thupping on the roof. It had a wide bandwidth of 40 kHz and sometimes exceeded 10 MW. human for scale. Image by Corsairoz This was during the Cold War and plenty of people rushed to the conclusion that it was some sort of Soviet mind control scheme or weather control experiment. But amateur radio operators traced the mysterious signal to an over-the-horizon radar antenna near Chernobyl Ukraine (then part of the USSR) and they named it the Russian Woodpecker. Here’s a clip of the sound The frequency-hopping Woodpecker signal was so strong that it made communication impossible on certain channels and could even be heard across telephone lines when conditions were right. Several countries filed official complaints with the USSR through the UN but there was no stopping the Russian Woodpecker. Russia wouldn’t even own up to the signal’s existence which has since been traced to that is nearly half a mile long and at 490 feet stands slightly taller than the Great Pyramid at Giza. This imposing steel structure stands within the irradiated forest near Pripyat an idyllic town founded in 1970 to house the Chernobyl nuclear plant workers. Pictured above is the transmitter or Duga-3 depending on who you ask. Located 30 miles northeast of Chernobyl on old Soviet maps the area is simply labeled Boy Scout Camp. Today It was such a secret that the government denied it’s existence yet was being heard all over the world. What was this mammoth installation used for? “The Russian Woodpecker: Official Bird Of The Cold War Nests In Giant Antenna” Original Game Boy Powered Up With GBA Motherboard The Game Boy DMG-01 is about as iconic as a piece of consumer electronics can get it hasn’t exactly aged well. While there’s certainly a number of games for the system that are still as entertaining in 2021 as they were in the 80s and 90s the hardware itself is another story entirely. Having to squint at the unlit display with its somewhat nauseating green tint certainly takes away from the experience of hunting down Pokémon. Which is precisely why [The Poor Student Hobbyist] decided to take an original Game Boy and replace its internals with more modern hardware in the form of a Game Boy Advance (GBA) SP motherboard and aftermarket IPS LCD panel. The backwards compatibility mode of the GBA allows him to play those classic Game Boy and Game Boy Color games from their original cartridges while the IPS display brings them to life in a way never before possible. Relocating the cartridge connector took several attempts. this might seem like a relatively simple project. After all the GBA SP was much smaller than its predecessors so there should be plenty of room inside the relatively cavernous DMG-01 case for the transplanted hardware. But [The Poor Student Hobbyist] made things quite a bit harder on himself by deciding early on that there would be no external signs that the Game Boy had been modified; beyond the wildly improved screen That meant deleting the GBA’s shoulder buttons though since the goal was always to play older games that predated their addition to the system that wasn’t really a problem. The GBA’s larger and wider screen is still intact albeit hidden behind the Game Boy’s original bezel. It turns out the image isn’t exactly centered on the physical display so [The Poor Student Hobbyist] came up with a 3D printed adapter to mount it with a slight offset. The adapter also allows the small tactile switch that controls the screen brightness to be mounted where the “Contrast” wheel used to go. An incredible amount of thought and effort went into making the final result look as close to stock as possible [The Poor Student Hobbyist] did a phenomenal job of documenting it for others who might want to make similar modifications. Even if you’re not in the market for a rejuvenated Game Boy it’s worth browsing through the build log to marvel at the passion that went into this project. Some would argue [The Poor Student Hobbyist] should have just put a Raspberry Pi into a Game Boy case but where’s the fun in that? Sure it might have been a somewhat better Bitcoin miner but there’s something to be said for playing classic games on real hardware. [Robo] took it upon himself to in discrete transistor form. For bonus points he also managed to put it in a package that’s the same basic size and a plug-in replacement for the original. The first task was deciding which 555 circuit to implement. He examined a handful of different implementations — and by examined dissected them and studied the die circuitry under a microscope. In the end he went with Hans Camenzind’s original circuit both as a tribute and because it used the fewest transistors — a point which helped manage the final size which is only a little bit bigger than the IC! have you ever soldered an EIA 01005 resistor? We agree with [mbedded.ninja] who wrote on a post about standard chip resistor sizes the 01005 is a “ridiculously small chip package that can barely be seen by the naked eye.”  It is 16 thou x 8 thou (0.4 mm x 0.2 mm) in size and despite its name and placement in the Imperial series it is not half the size of an 0201. The transistors are your standard 2N3904 / 2N3906 but purchased in a not-so-standard DFN (Dual Flat Pack No Leads). We might think a 1.0 x 0.6 mm component as small but compared to its neighboring resistors in this circuit [Robo] has done this kind of project before discrete recreation of of the classic 741 op-amp back in 2011. If you want to go really big-scale with your own reproduction project from five years ago for further inspiration. Thanks to [Lucas] for the tip. If you are of a certain age your first exposure to computer programming was probably BASIC. For a few years there were few cheaper ways to program in BASIC than the Sinclair ZX series of computers. If you long for those days you might find the 1980-something variant of BASIC a little limiting. Or you could use SpecBasic is apparently reasonably compatible with the Spectrum but lets you use your better hardware. For example instead of a 256×192 8-color screen SpecBas accommodates larger screens and up to 256 colors. However that does lead to certain incompatibilities that you can read about in the project’s README file.

Many algorithms are recursive in nature. When we analyze them we get a recurrence relation for time complexity. We get running time on an input of size n as a function of n and the running time on inputs of smaller sizes. For example in to sort a given array we divide it in two halves and recursively repeat the process for the two halves. Finally we merge the results. Time complexity of Merge Sort can be written as T(n) = 2T(n/2) + cn. There are many other algorithms like Binary Search There are mainly three ways for solving recurrences. : We make a guess for the solution and then we use mathematical induction to prove the guess is correct or incorrect. For example consider the recurrence T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n

We guess the solution as T(n) = O(nLogn). Now we use induction
to prove our guess.

We need to prove that T(n) <= cnLogn. We can assume that it is true
for values smaller than n.

T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n
    <= 2cn/2Log(n/2) + n
    =  cnLogn - cnLog2 + n
    =  cnLogn - cn + n
    <= cnLogn we draw a recurrence tree and calculate the time taken by every level of tree. Finally we sum the work done at all levels. To draw the recurrence tree we start from the given recurrence and keep drawing till we find a pattern among levels. The pattern is typically a arithmetic or geometric series. For example consider the recurrence relation 
T(n) = T(n/4) + T(n/2) + cn /      \
     T(n/4)     T(n/2)

If we further break down the expression T(n/4) and T(n/2) we get following recursion tree.

                cn /           \      
       c(n )/16      c(n )/4
      /      \          /     \
  T(n/16)     T(n/8)  T(n/8)    T(n/4) 
Breaking down further gives us following
                 cn /            \      
       c(n )/16          c(n )/4
       /      \            /      \
c(n )/16
 /    \      /    \    /    \       /    \  

To know the value of T(n) we need to calculate sum of tree 
nodes level by level. If we sum the above tree level by level we get the following series
T(n)  = c(n^2 + 5(n^2)/16 + 25(n^2)/256) + ....
The above series is geometrical progression with ratio 5/16.

To get an upper bound we can sum the infinite series. 
We get the sum as (n )/(1 - 5/16) which is O(n Master Method is a direct way to get the solution. The master method works only for following type of recurrences or for recurrences that can be transformed to following type. T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n) where a >= 1 and b > 1 Master method is mainly derived from recurrence tree method. If we draw recurrence tree of T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n) we can see that the work done at root is f(n) and work done at all leaves is Θ(n a. And the height of recurrence tree is Log we calculate total work done. If the work done at leaves is polynomially more then leaves are the dominant part and our result becomes the work done at leaves (Case 1). If work done at leaves and root is asymptotically same then our result becomes height multiplied by work done at any level (Case 2). If work done at root is asymptotically more then our result becomes work done at root (Case 3). Examples of some standard algorithms whose time complexity can be evaluated using Master Method : T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Θ(n). It falls in case 2 as c is 1 and Log a] is also 1. So the solution is Θ(n Logn) : T(n) = T(n/2) + Θ(1). It also falls in case 2 as c is 0 and Log a is also 0. So the solution is Θ(Logn) It is not necessary that a recurrence of the form T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n) can be solved using Master Theorem. The given three cases have some gaps between them. For example the recurrence T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n/Logn cannot be solved using master method. Case 2 can be extended for f(n) = Θ(n n) for some constant k >= 0 and c = Log Practice Problems and Solutions on Master Theorem.

In Amortized Analysis we analyze a sequence of operations and guarantee a worst case average time which is lower than the worst case time of a particular expensive operation. The example data structures whose operations are analyzed using Amortized Analysis are Hash Tables Disjoint Sets and Splay Trees. Let us consider an example of a simple hash table insertions. How do we decide table size? There is a trade-off between space and time if we make hash-table size big but space required becomes high. The solution to this trade-off problem is to use . The idea is to increase size of table whenever it becomes full. Following are the steps to follow when table becomes full. 1) Allocate memory for a larger table of size typically twice the old table. 2) Copy the contents of old table to new table. If the table has space available we simply insert new item in available space. What is the time complexity of n insertions using the above scheme? the worst case cost of an insertion is O(n). Therefore worst case cost of n inserts is n * O(n) which is O(n ). This analysis gives an upper bound but not a tight upper bound for n insertions as all insertions don’t take Θ(n) time. we could prove that the Dynamic Table scheme has O(1) insertion time which is a great result used in hashing. Also the concept of dynamic table is used in Amortized cost of a sequence of operations can be seen as expenses of a salaried person. The average monthly expense of the person is less than or equal to the salary but the person can spend more money in a particular month by buying a car or something. In other months he or she saves money for the expensive month. The above Amortized Analysis done for Dynamic Array example is called . There are two more powerful ways to do Amortized analysis called . We will be discussing the other two methods in separate posts. The amortized analysis doesn’t involve probability. There is also another different notion of average-case running time where algorithms use randomization to make them faster and expected running time is faster than the worst-case running time. These algorithms are analyzed using Randomized Analysis. Examples of these algorithms are Randomized Quick Sort Quick Select and Hashing. We will soon be covering Randomized analysis in a different post. Amortized analysis of insertion in Red-Black Tree Let us discuss the Amortized Analysis of Red-Black Tree operations (Insertion) using Potential Method. To perform the amortized analysis of Red-Black Tree Insertion operation we use Potential(or Physicist’s) method. For potential method we define a potential function that maps a data structure to a non-negative real value. An operation can result in a change of this potential. Let us define the potential function where n is a node of Red-Black Tree over all nodes of the red black tree. we define the amortized time of an operation as: where h and h’ are the states of Red-Black Tree before and after the operation respectively c is the actual cost of the operation The change in potential should be positive for low-cost operations and negative for high-cost operations. A new node is inserted on a leaf of a red-black tree. We have the leaves of a red-black tree of any one of the following types: The insertions and their amortized analysis can be represented as: This insertion is performed by first recolouring the parent and the other sibling(red). Then the grandparent and uncle of that leaf node is considered for further recolouring which leads to the (when grandparent of the leaf node is red) (when uncle of the leaf is black and grandparent is black) or (when uncle of the leaf is red and grandparent is black). The insertion can be shown as: the node is inserted without any changes as the black depth of the leaves remain the same. This is the case when leaf may have a (since we consider the colour of the colour of null node to be black). we cannot recolour the leaf node its parent and the sibling such that the black depth stays the same as before. So we need to perform a Left- Left rotation. there are no changes when the grandparent of g(the inserted node) is black. Also for the case of Red Grandparent of g(the inserted node) we do not have any changes. So the insertion is completed with . The insertion has been depicted below: After calculating these particular amortized costs at the leaf site of a red-black tree we can discuss the nature of of insertion in a red-black tree. Since this may happen that two red nodes may have a parent-child relationship till the root of the red-black tree. we reduce the number of black nodes with two red children by 1 and we at most increase the number of black nodes with no red children by 1 leaving a net loss of at most 1 to the potential function. Since one unit of potential pays for each operation therefore where n is total number of nodes of insertion in Red-Black Tree is For any doubts regarding insertions in red black tree Please write comments if you find anything incorrect or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above.

Following are the correct definitions of Auxiliary Space and Space Complexity. is the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm. of an algorithm is total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input. if we want to compare standard sorting algorithms on the basis of space then Auxiliary Space would be a better criteria than Space Complexity. Merge Sort uses O(n) auxiliary space Insertion sort and Heap Sort use O(1) auxiliary space. Space complexity of all these sorting algorithms is O(n) though. Space complexity is a parallel concept to time complexity. If we need to create an array of size n this will require O(n) space. If we create a two dimensional array of size n*n In recursive calls stack space also counts. int add (int n){
    if (n <= 0){
        return 0;
    }
    return n + add (n-1);
}

Here each call add a level to the stack :

1.  add(4)
2.    -> add(3)
3.      -> add(2)
4.        -> add(1)
5.          -> add(0)

Each of these calls is added to call stack and takes up actual memory.
So it take O(n) space. However just because you have n calls total doesn’t mean it takes O(n) space. Look at the below function : int addSequence (int n){
    int sum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        sum+ = pairSum(i i+1);
    }
    return sum;
}

int paiSem(int x int y){
    return x + y;
}

There will be roughly O(n) calls to pairSum. However those 
calls do not exist simultaneously on the call stack so you only need O(1) space. Note: It’s necessary to mention that space complexity depends on a variety of things such as the programming language or even the machine running the algorithm.

document: the elements and attributes that can appear in a document the number of (and order of) child elements data types for elements and attributes default and fixed values for elements and attributes hundreds of standardized XML formats are in daily use. Many of these XML standards are defined by XML Schemas. XML Schema is an XML-based (and more powerful) alternative to DTD. One of the greatest strength of XML Schemas is the support for data types. It is easier to describe allowable document content It is easier to validate the correctness of data It is easier to define data facets (restrictions on data) It is easier to define data patterns (data formats) It is easier to convert data between different data types Another great strength about XML Schemas is that they are written in XML. You don't have to learn a new language You can use your XML editor to edit your Schema files You can use your XML parser to parse your Schema files You can manipulate your Schema with the XML DOM You can transform your Schema with XSLT because they are written in XML. With an extensible Schema definition you can: Reuse your Schema in other Schemas Create your own data types derived from the standard types Reference multiple schemas in the same document When sending data from a sender to a receiver it is essential that both parts
have the same ""expectations"" about the content. the sender can describe the data in a way that the receiver
will understand. be interpreted as 3.November
and in other countries as 11.March. an XML element with a data type
like this: ensures a mutual understanding of the content because the XML data type ""date""
requires the format ""YYYY-MM-DD"". A well-formed XML document is a document that conforms to the XML syntax
rules it must begin with the XML declaration it must have one unique root element all elements must be properly nested all attribute values must be quoted entities must be used for special characters Even if documents are well-formed they can still contain errors and those errors can have serious consequences. Think of the following situation: you order 5 gross of laser printers instead of 5 laser
printers. With XML Schemas most of these errors can be caught by your

A pseudo-polynomial time solution for this is to first find the maximum value then iterate from 1 to maximum value and for each value find its frequency in array. This solution requires time according to maximum value in input array therefore pseudo-polynomial. On the other hand an algorithm whose time complexity is only based on number of elements in array (not value) is considered as polynomial time algorithm. Some NP-Complete problems have Pseudo Polynomial time solutions. For example problems are Pseudo-Polynomial. NP complete problems that can be solved using a pseudo-polynomial time algorithms are called weakly NP-complete. .

This fork is used by the ESP-IDF Programming Guide. Espressif forked this theme when we moved ESP-IDF Programming Guide away from Read The Docs' hosted service and needed some functionality that neither RTD nor the theme provide out of the box. This theme must be imported as a Python package as it relies on some code in needs a mixture of Python and JavaScript in order to build. So currently it's necessary install in order to build it locally. To debug the theme in development doesn't seem to work out of the box (can probably be made to work easily please update this file if you know the steps). The following hacky approach definitely works: it will import the just-built theme from this directory as a package. Can support a new URL component under the RTD if the project has multiple targets which each have a totally different docs build. Loads the version information in the versions popup using JavaScript on the client (see ""Versions file"" below). No dynamic webserver support is needed but the popup can be updated without needing to rebuild all versions of the docs. Templates for layout & versions.html have been modified. To Use In a Sphinx Project Set the following additional config variables in the Sphinx project: - slug of the IDF target (ie esp32 but either both this option and must be set or neither must be set. - Python list with short names of all supported IDF targets (ie - Python dictonary which maps from short names of all supported IDF targets (ie - Python list with short names of all supported languages (ie ).

The file should take this form: This file is JavaScript so it can be easily included in a script tag but in the future it may be parsed elsewhere. Therefore is should contain a single assignment statement which assigns the variable to a valid JSON object. Including any other JavaScript computation in this file is invalid. key is a list of versions Each version is a JSON object with at minimum a key which is the version name ""slug"" (corresponds to one or more of the following keys:

So there must be a way to handle them. We have seen algorithms to these problems which are p approximate (For example cheme (PTAS) is a type of approximate algorithms that provide user to control over accuracy which is a desirable feature. These algorithms take an additional parameter ε > 0 and provide a solution that is (1 + ε) approximate for minimization and (1 – ε) for maximization. For example consider a minimization problem then the solution provided by the PTAS algorithm is 1.5 approximate. The running time of PTAS must be polynomial in terms of n it can be exponential in terms of ε. the exponent of the polynomial can increase dramatically as ε reduces for example if the runtime is O(n ) which is a problem. There is a stricter scheme algorithm need to polynomial in both the problem size n and 1/ε. is NP Complete. There is a DP based for this. But if input values are high then the solution becomes infeasible and there is a need of approximate solution. One approximate solution is to use Greedy Approach (compute value per kg for all items and put the highest value per kg first if it is smaller than W) but Greedy approach is not PTAS so we don’t have control over accuracy. Below is a FPTAS solution for 0-1 Knapsack problem: find maximum value in val[]. Let this maximum value be maxVal. Compute adjustment factor k for all values k  = (maxVal * ε) / n create a new array val'[] that values divided by k. Do following for every value val[i]. val'[0..n-1] and all other parameter same. The above solution works in polynomial time in terms of both n and ε. The solution provided by this FPTAS is (1 – ε) approximate. The idea is to rounds off some of the least significant digits of values then they will be bounded by a polynomial and 1/ε. 2}
W = 10
ε = 0.5
 
maxVal = 16 [maximum value in val[]]
Adjustment factor k = (16 * 0.5)/4 = 2.0

Now we apply DP based solution on below modified 
instance of problem.

val'[] = {6 4}  [ val'[i] = floor(val[i]/k) ]
wt[] = {3 How is the solution (1 – ε) * OPT? be the set produced by above FPTAS algorithm and total value of S be val(S). We need to show that be the set produced by optimal solution (the solution with total value OPT) val(O) - k*val'(O) <= n*k 
       [Because val'[i] = floor(val[i]/k) ] we get a set that is optimal for the scaled instance and therefore must be at least as good as choosing the set O with the smaller profits. From that val'(S) >= k . val'(O)
              >= val(O) - nk

1620761181.838417,99570321,https://hackaday.com/about/,Hackaday serves up Fresh Hacks Every Day from around the Internet. Our playful posts are the gold-standard in entertainment for engineers and engineering enthusiasts. We are taking back the term “Hacking” which has been soured in the public mind. Hacking is an art form that uses something in a way in which it was not originally intended. This highly creative activity can be highly technical or both. Hackers bask in the glory of building it instead of buying it repairing it rather than trashing it and raiding their junk bins for new projects every time they can steal a few moments away. is a mix of hacks from around the community as well as our own original content. We strive to promote the free and open exchange of ideas and information ( ). We educate those just learning the art of Hack and provide inspiration for the seasoned veterans. Don’t be shy; if you want to show off your project or have found something cool of someone else’s that deserves sharing Hackaday — you should delve deeper into the community. Document your work on our hosting site at . Tell the world about your interests and show off the stuff you’ve already built. Start a build log for that project you’ve been dreaming of recently. Make some friends and collaborate with them on a project. Get lost digging through mountains of gnarly hacks. Mike is an Orchestra Musician by night and a writer by day. His entrance into electronics started with BEAM robot builds but quickly moved into the realm of embedded systems. He spends his waking hours chasing down new tricks performed through clever application of existing hardware. This has suited him well since joining Hackaday.com in 2009. He has an unquenchable thirst for seeing future technology become reality before his eyes — a drive perfectly suited for the hardware hacking universe. Let me tell you a little bit about Elliot Williams. He’s the kind of guy who uses a 1990’s 5″ hard drive platter as a scroll wheel. The kind of guy whose oscilloscope cost just a tiny bit less than his last two cars combined. He’s the kind of guy who stays up late debugging home-brew PCBs for random synthesizer modules or figuring out why that interrupt routine isn’t firing. He loves to see projects that are either ultra-minimalist — cleverly squeezing every ounce of performance out of some cheap silicon — or so insanely over the top that they dazzle you with overkill. In short After spending eight great years in Washington DC teaching econometrics and working on inflation by day and running a hackerspace by night Elliot handed in his badge moved to Munich and started writing as a hacker. Writing his first book — — took a lot longer than you’d think. Now he’s pleased as punch to be writing as much possible for Hackaday. [Jenny List]: Contributing Editor and European Correspondent Jenny List trained as an electronic engineer but spent twenty years in the publishing industry working on everything from computer games to She grew up around her parents’ small farm and blacksmith business in rural England so making (and breaking) things is in her blood. Countless projects have crossed her bench over the years though these days you’ll find her working with electronics and in particular radio textiles for clothing and costume When she’s not writing for Hackaday she works on language corpus analysis software designs and sells amateur radio kits sits on the board of and is a freelance electronic design engineer and programmer. Tom was weaned on the flickering light of the MS-DOS prompt but didn’t see the true path until somebody handed him a Slackware install disc in high school. Since then Tom has been a passionate supporter of open source hardware and software and believes the free exchange of information is the cornerstone to any successful endeavour. While Tom has contributed to and developed a number of open source projects a desire for getting his hand’s dirty kept him away from a career in software development. At the crossroads of open source and hardware tinkering Tom found a new obsession in 3D printing and most of his recent exploits have involved finding ways to capitalize on this exciting new era of home manufacturing. Tom is usually tinkering with embedded Linux and anything else sufficiently indistinguishable from magic. [Dan Maloney]: Staff Writer and Community Engineer Dan has been a tinkerer since the days when Radio Shack still issued an annual paper catalog. Scientist by training but developer by necessity Dan left his Ph.D. program with a Master’s in biology when he realized that automating his experiments and data capture was far more interesting than the ribosomal whooziewhatsis he was supposed to be studying. He spent his career keeping the R&D pipeline filled at a Major Pharmaceutical Company by automating experiments and data capture. What goes around comes around. Dan recently moved his family to beautiful North Idaho (which is not the part with the potatoes) where he gets to watch the sun rise over the Rockies every day. He has also been known to cosplay with his kids although he’ll deny it if asked. Adam has a degree in Electrical Engineering from SUNY Stony Brook. While at school he was a founding member of the Stony Brook robot design team. He helped design David and Rogue six legged robots that competed in the SAE walking machine decathlon.It’s often said that Adam has been taking things apart since he was old enough to hold a screwdriver. Sometimes he even gets them back together. Adam’s day job is designing embedded software for Radar and Air Traffic Control systems. He also spends time working on the hardware for these systems. It was this merging of hardware and software that lead to his personal site – . When he’s not at work Adam can often be found in his basement lab working on anything from 3D printers to quadcopters to pulse oximeters. Some of his current projects have taken him back to his robotic roots designing robots for students and education. Joe is an artist/designer from all over California. Since graduating from Art Center College of Design in Pasadena he’s created images for Disney and many more. He is now pushing pixels full time for Supplyframe and the Hackaday team. Al was in love with computers and ham radio before the Altair 8800 arrived. In the intervening years he’s designed hardware and software systems ranging from tiny embedded sensors to mainframe build systems. He’s been an editor or columnist for several magazines including Dr. Dobb’s Journal and has written numerous books on hardware and software topics. He has a strong passion for digital design especially implementing CPUs on FPGAs. When he isn’t soldering or programming you might find Al at a local high school teaching kids about engineering or riding his Can Am Spyder in the sweltering summer heat. Kristina is a writer who makes things. desires nothing more than the build. Obsessed with cars and will play spies with you if you’ve got a walkie talkie (he’s got six). University educated in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering because fighter jets sounded like more fun than electronics. After a brief stint in the automotive industry now employed as a writer & film maker. He lives for good times and wild experiences generally documenting them in explicit detail on video. They often involve beaches and music – and a whole lot of smoking power transistors. Also known as TK. The T stands for T the K stands for K. Bil Herd is a self-taught engineer who started as a licensed TV/CB Repairman in his teens. By the age of 24 he was working as a senior design engineer for Commodore Business Machines in the mid 1980’s where he is best known for home computers including the Commodore C128 and Plus4/264 series of home computers. Bil continued to design hardware until the mid-1990’s having co-authored a high speed/machine vision patent when he was bitten by the entrepreneurial bug and has since founded several networking and software design companies. Bil attributes his design style and his intuitive understanding of electronics to having come up through the ranks of troubleshooting. He loves the part of engineering that can be scary: analog circuits RF and high speed digital/FPGA. Having designed complex products that had production runs in the millions Bil tends to see a design as a living ecosystem and believes that a good designer needs to be both meticulous and artistic. (referring to an Easter Egg embedded in the C128) where he hopes to figure out and join the Open Source Hardware community as an active member. Eric is finishing up a degree in Electrical Engineering at the University of Waterloo Canada. During his time at Waterloo he’s been involved with the University of Waterloo Alternative Fuels Team ( developing electronics and controls systems for hybrid vehicle powertrains. He has also had some fun making things go boom with the Waterloo Rocketry Team ( ).His co-op placements have given him the chance to develop production hardware and firmware. He designed a vehicle data logger while at CrossChasm Technologies and worked on the first ever over-the-air firmware upgrade for a car at Tesla Motors. Alek is still figuring it all out but has been around for a while. Started out as Linux systems/embedded engineer he spent most of his career so far playing with challenges at the intersection of infrastructure (large-scale/high-performance stuff) crypto) and data (signal processing machine learning). He holds Bachelor’s Degree in Electrical Engineering MSc in Computer Science and MSc in Statistics. He’s obsessed with computation art and building unnecessary complex things. Also noise. In his real life he’s the CTO and overlord-in-residence at Supplyframe. Will is very lucky to have a day job that fits into his hobby of hacking. He travels all over the country to some of the most prestigious universities and largest corporations to repair scientific instruments. He brings back faulty parts and uses them in all kinds of neat projects. Will has been hacking since 2008 and mostly enjoys reverse engineering hardware and firmware. One of his favorite hacks is to take animatronic toys and make them say things they were never supposed to. He has done two high altitude balloon projects and he really wants to push this area further. You can do some cool stuff up there. [Jasmine Brackett]: Tindie and the Hackaday Store Before moving to sunny SoCal from the UK Jasmine managed charity and museum websites while studying Theatrical Costume Making. She hates to see things go to waste and loves to reuse and re-purpose items that normally go to landfill. When she is not looking after the Tindie Community she likes to combine her historical costume construction skills with electronics and helps out with collaborative art projects. visiting research scientist at Camera Culture Group Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab co-founder of Hyperfine Research Inc. and Butterfly Network Inc. editor of the Gregory L.

Career-wise he’s traveled the world teaching engineers how to write applications with QNX and now spends much of the time making stuff and publishing it through his Rich has been writing software since he got his first computer and decided to make it into a career. He’s now a software developer who works in the video game industry. He got into electronics by building guitar pedals tweaking and modding them as he went. From there he got into Arduino and microcontrollers. Using these he learned he could control things with a combination of hardware and software. He’s been very interested in the intersection of DIY electronics and music for years and has several projects on the go. Currently his dining room table is littered with various development boards much to the chagrin of those in his house who’d like to have dinner. Pedro is a security researcher by day and Hackaday contributor by night. He started messing around with computers on a Spectrum watched the bulletin board systems being dropped for the Internet but still roams around in IRC. Known by the handle [kripthor] he likes all kind of hacks hardware and software. If it’s security related even better. A MacGyver fan as a child IP started with electronics at the age of 10 as a self taught tinkerer in the age of dialup modems and tone hacks. It all started with Scripts 555s and IR remote hacks. After working in the toll automation industry as both designer and manager he currently enjoys teaching engineering fundamentals​ part-time while he works on his PhD and other fun and paid projects. He works on everything from microcontrollers to FPGAs and from C to CSS. His better half is a software engineer and they have a son named Anhad Makhni who has all the tell-tale signs of a becoming a maker/hacker. Brian McEvoy is an electrical engineer by day and a maker by night. If he’s not engineering he’s probably asleep and he only does that because he’d probably die otherwise. He prefers hardware to software but enjoys programming despite evidence on his university transcript. He has been interviewed by newspapers and even a fashionista (although the fashionista was more of a joke). His favorite color is checkers and he likes food in red packaging. Podcast: Two Cyborgs and a Microphone Personal website: 24 Hour Engineer blog Sven is a software mercenary by profession handling anything from Linux kernel space development on FPGA systems to Android apps. In his free time he prefers to go even lower spending the nights programming bare metal firmware for microcontrollers and designing PCBs. Originally from a small village in the South of Germany he decided to move to Northern Finland a few years ago — a great place for LED lighting projects during those dark winter months. Besides programming and electronics creating music is his next passion dabbling in song writing and home recording whenever possible. Roger is a lifelong tinkerer who enjoys fun software challenges and clever mechanical designs. After concluding one career in operating system software he looked for ways to combine his software experience with his many other interests. The search opened his eyes to advances that have made more things more accessible to hackers than ever before: from 3D printing to open source software libraries to the global supply chain available online. And most of all the rise of information sharing communities like Hackaday. Roger is excited to learn about all the technologies and share cool projects with the world. Quinn has been making games for 36 years on platforms ranging from the Apple II to all manner of newfangled things. She currently manages engineering for mobile games at Scopely. She also pursues consulting and writing. In her spare time she welds things and berates her friends with sarcasm. Kerry is a firmware engineer with a bent for anything as long as it involves more than a blinking cursor. By day he can be found at a tool-covered bench tracing an errant signal or probing at a misbehaving register. By night he is often found in much the same situation. Learning alone is no fun and he’s at his happiest when sharing an interesting tidbit or two with someone else preferably at your local hacker convention. Recently he’s been exploring the boundaries between the hobbyist maker and professional industry of cottage electronics manufacturing. Ben is an electronic product design engineer with a passion for software who lives in the UK. He loves building and flying drones When he’s not reverse engineering random bits of kit Ben plays jazz piano and classical church organ. It’s unclear what started Jonathan Bennett down the Open Source/hacker path. He’s old enough to remember the time before common access to the internet but young enough to have grown up with internet access. Regardless he installed Fedora Core on his laptop and never looked back. The years since have made Jonathan into quite the jack-of-all-trades though he prefers to call himself a Renaissance man. Whether using a compiler he can convincingly act like he knows what he’s doing. he runs a small IT business and tries to keep up with a weekly security column on Hackaday . Not to mention staying busy with his growing family. Growing up on a farm in the Netherlands Maya was tragically left to her own devices with lots of space leading to her early introduction to everything from woodworking and welding to using computers and the internet. Many a device that stopped working was gleefully torn part and occasionally repaired. Maya is a software developer with a strong focus on embedded and hardware development. She writes books on these and other topics and is rumoured to be now an AI running on a supercomputer in a hidden lair somewhere in this galaxy. Drew has the same sort of Lego inspired backstory that any other engineer does. Retro and repurposed tech is what he’s all about. On occasion he is known to make project tutorials as well as videos that discuss the finer points of videogames. As a D.I.Y. enthusiast he genuinely believes that most things would be a little better with some woodgrain. Jordon Clark is a Digital Producer with over 6 years experience creating and publishing content for major media outlets including… Hackaday Majenta Strongheart is an emerging designer from San Francisco working at the intersection of design and fine arts. She is interested in socially positive design and collaboration; focusing on the ways design thinking and problem solving can contribute to a diverse range of conversations. Through her work Majenta aims to spark curiosity provide access to new topics Erin learned to do a lot using very little. One of her hobbies is picking up unwanted or discarded tech and fixing it to build her collections on the cheap. She’s completing her Bachelor’s Degree in Information Systems but feels absolutely no desire to earn her living building apps for startups or (ehhh) working as a data analyst. Instead she wants to do the fun stuff like art and now she’s trying her hand at writing too. During her spare time she’s hacked all sorts of things ranging from a Sega Master System all the way up to her own identity. Erin goes on record as stating that she identifies strongly with the character Weebo from Flubber. Sharon Lin is studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT teams. She enjoys discovering side-channel attacks and hardware teardowns. She’s worked on performance engineering and has run workshops on embedded systems. She is originally from Queens where she developed an appreciation for community-run makerspaces.

He spends most of his free time developing open source hardware for students Moritz earned a PhD in physics and worked in fundamental research before making the tough decision to leave university and get a “real job”. Adam loves finding new outlets to satisfy his passion for creating and taking on assorted hardware and software projects (which sometimes even work). He earned his bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from Carnegie Mellon then worked at SpaceX for a few months before returning to CMU for his master’s. Now he’s an engineer at Boston Dynamics. Adam likes cars and the color purple. He probably just bought another camera. Matthew is determined to be as well rounded as possible. His day job is currently as a software engineer working on UEFI. Outside of work he spends his time renovating a home or tackling the muse of the week. His greatest weakness is starting another project before the current one is actually finished. Chris got hooked on electronics and Ham radio as a teenager in the 70s. In high school he played video games on an Atari 2600 console learned to program BASIC on a TRS-80 and learned RPN on an HP-25 calculator. Then at Ga Tech in the 80s he learned FORTRAN via punched cards and assembly language on micro- and mini-computers. When he wasn’t busy studying or building a satellite tracking station for the Ham radio club Chris worked as a coop student for the university on a number of projects. He worked on a team doing 3D computer modeling on a VAX restored a 1947 analog computer for Ga Power and interfaced an old Data General Nova II to several instrumentation radars. Besides graduating with his degree the high point of those years was spending a few weeks at the North Pole collecting radar measurements of sea ice. AL and worked in the government and aerospace industry focusing on radar and NASA projects. In the early 2000s Chris got fed up with government red-tape and refocused his career on industrial and consumer electronics. He eventually relocated to South Korea in 2004 where he started a niche-market electronics manufacturing company and runs an engineering consultancy called The Stumbler. He is interested in everything but tries to stay focused these days on all things embedded and Ham radio when he has a chance. Stephen got his first taste of hacking in high school when he started modifying electric guitars. He was immediately hooked and wound up doing a PhD in Electrical Engineering which he spent hacking the hardware of MRI scanners. Raised in Texas Stephen presently lives in London and works as a postdoc on experimental MRI hardware. His present interests include embedded system development There has been a long list of great Editors and Contributors to Hackaday.

1620761238.381469,56003246,https://hackaday.com/2021/05/10/the-armv9-isa-and-what-it-can-do-for-you/,And What It Can Do For You The number of distinct ARM Instruction Set Architectures (ISA) versions has slowly increased with Arm adding a new version every few years. The oldest ISA version in common use today is ARMv6 with the ARMv6 ISA ( ) found in the original Raspberry Pi SBC and Raspberry Pi Zero (BCM2835). The ARMv6 ISA was introduced in 2002 followed by ARMv7 in 2005 (start of Cortex-A series) and ARMv8 in 2011. The latter was notable for adding 64-bit support. With ARMv7 being the first of the Cortex cores and ARMv8 adding 64-bit support in the form of AArch64 what notable features does ARMv9 bring to the table? ARMv9’s focus appears to be on adding a whole host of features that should improve vector processing (vector extensions or SVE) as well as digital signal processing (DSP) and security with its Confidential Compute Architecture (CCA). ARMv9 also includes all of the features that were added with ARMv8.1 v8.3 and so on. In essence this makes an ARMv9-based processor theoretically capable of going toe-to-toe with the best that Intel and AMD have to offer. It should be obvious that ARMv9 is not an ISA which we’ll be seeing soon in budget single-board computers (SBCs) like the Raspberry Pi and kin. The BCM2711 SoC of the Raspberry Pi 4 which implement the ARMv8-A specification. Since then Additional instructions for atomic read/write and more. Improved virtualization support (e.g. Virtualization Host Extensions). Additional instructions for a variety of of tasks like half-precision floating point data processing. Followed later that year by ARMv8.3-A: The next three updates added and refined more functionality creating an impressive list of required and optional updates to the base ARMv-8 specification. Not surprisingly this large number of ISA specifications is a bit messy and one of the things that ARMv9 accomplishes is bringing all of these versions together in one specification. Another thing which ARMv9 adds over ARMv8 is Scalable Vector Extension version two (SVE2) and essentially the replacement of the NEON SIMD instructions. As Arm notes the NEON instructions are still in ARMv9 but only for backwards compatibility. As the ‘Scalable’ part of SVE suggests a major benefit of SVE over NEON is that it scales to the underlying hardware less powerful platforms to still handle the same SVE2-based code as a higher-end chip. being one of the first systems to make use of it upon its introduction last year. This means that ARMv9’s SVE2 will be very important for applications that process data which benefit from SIMD-based algorithms. New in ARMv9 is the concept of ‘realms’ which can be considered as a kind of secure container in which code can execute without affecting the rest of the system. This works together with e.g. a hypervisor with the latter handing a large part of the security-related operations to a new Realm Manager. The exact details of which aren’t known at this point beyond the information which Arm made available at its recent announcement. Basic example of how CCA Realms can be used. (Credit: Arm) but available since v8.5 is Memory Tagging Extension ( ). Memory tagging is a mechanism to track illegal memory operations on a hardware level. This is similar to what Valgrind’s Memcheck tool does when it keeps track of memory accesses in order to detect buffer overflows and out of bounds writes and reads except with MTE this is supported on a hardware level. Having these features in the ARMv9 specification means that upcoming ARM processors and SoCs are likely to offer virtualization and security options that make them interesting for data centers and other applications were virtualization and security are essential. revealed the first two CPU cores which are based on the ARMv9 specification. These Neoverse V1 (“Zeus”) and N2 (“Perseus”) cores. Both of these are targeting data centers and HPC applications and other cloud providers likely to use them. The low-down is that for in the near term ARMv9 is something that the average consumer will have little if anything to do with as there’s not much incentive for many platforms to change even from baseline ARMv8-A to ARMv6-A. The need to license new cores and new IP is of course another factor here. All of this means that for the coming years it’s not likely that we’ll see ARMv9-based silicon appear in mobile devices or new single-board computers. (Sounds kind of like a challenge for Hackaday readers That is not to say that it isn’t an interesting development especially once ARMv9 with SVE2 and CCA ultimately do appear on those platforms. With massively improved SIMD performance — for example — many data processing and encoding tasks will suddenly become a lot faster which could be a boon for anyone who wishes to daily drive an ARM-based system. As alluded to in the beginning of this article the ARM ecosystem is relatively fragmented at this point especially when one considers the highly popular Raspberry Pi boards and their simultaneous with middling support for AArch64 on the latter. Although it has its benefits to be able to use the backwards compatibility in ARMv8 and v7 for running ARMv6 (‘armhf’) binaries it also removes a large part of the benefits of moving to these newer ISAs. With 32-bit support in the world of Intel and AMD already firmly a thing of the past it does seem rather quaint to hang on to 32-bit-only ARM ISAs especially when simultaneously proclaiming the capabilities of these systems as a . Even just the 4 GB system memory and per-process memory limitations that come with a 32-bit architecture are sufficient to ruin a lot of potential fun there. How long will it take before ARMv6 and ARMv7 will join ARMv5 into retirement? That’s not an easy question to answer at this point even though the answer will likely play a major role in the answer to the question of how long it will likely take for ARMv9 to start playing a pertinent role outside of data centers. Amidst all this talk about server chips and SoCs it’s sometimes easy to forget that ARM-based microcontrollers also use ISAs related to the Application profile ISAs. These -M (Microcontroller) post-fixed specifications have been updated over the years as well instruction set. This ISA adds the Helium vector processing extensions adding significant SIMD capabilities to MCUs. While the Application profile of ARMv9 won’t directly translate to the Microcontroller profiles in a feature-for-feature manner any features which do make sense for an MCU platform are very likely to be translated to the latter in some fashion. Virtualization features for one do make little sense but memory tagging as in MTE and further debug and monitoring features could be desirable. When the first MCUs based on the Cortex-M55 appear over the coming years this should give us a glimpse of what ARMv9 may bring in this area as well. Whether we will be programming those MCUs from ARM-based desktop systems by then is however still up in the air. TrueTape64 Is A PC Interface For Your C64 Datasette And What It Can Do For You Although I can still buy (except for “chip shortage”) cortex-M0 the new processors from ST and the likes tend to be reasonably modern ARM cores. If they aim for datacenter only use then they can expect CPUs to sell for $1000+ Then that would allow a licencing fee that’s significant vs what people are willing to pay for a microcontroller. But once that licencing fee is low enough I expect to see a couple of years before we see reasonably small stuff also supporting ARMv9. Nowadays I get an ARMV8 in my raspberry- and other pi’s right? A couple of years from now you get ARMV9 in that segment. The embedded processors that I use are ARMv7 and never use the features beyond ARMv6. So the features not being strictly necessary is not an argument to not just implement the newer architecture in the newer chips. Assuming Nvidia purchase of Arm get shoot down by regulators in various countries… There is very little reason for Arm to drasticly increase their licensing fees as RISC-V and others might eat them for lunch for low end cores.  They are almost giving the microcontroller Cortex cores out for free. >Upfront Costs: $0 for the Cortex-M0 The old Cortext M would be in the high volume budget microcontrollers. The higher performances cores are likely be in the *microprocessor* lines as they are not stand alone parts – either require external DRAM or stacked DRAM die.  Their minimum prices will be limited by their die size (+ DRAM cost) and won’t be in the same market. Not sure about a couple of years for ARMv9 on dev boards ARMv8 was announced october 2011 while the raspberry pi 4 was released in 2019. Other chips were faster RK3399 releasing 2016 and hitting dev boards in 2017 (?). The S905 was early 2016 I think? On the other hand the market has changed and there’s more interest in high performance ARM systems these days. I’d guess 5 years. ARM designers: “RISC is finally taking its rightful place! Down with complex ISAs!” (Not saying it’s wrong or bad I guess you have to have a happen medium between pure RISC and CISC.  Some things just need to be done in the hardware for speed and efficiency. I know I dived into some assembly on the RPI4 loading the 64bit version of PI OS to learn ARM 64 assembly.  Best way to learn is to ‘do’.  I rather enjoyed it and the freedom of ‘lots’ of registers to work with over what I remember having to deal with on the z80 ARM has though been a CISC architecture for a very long time…. It isn’t much RISC left in it. Implementing more application specific instructions does increase both peak performance and peak power efficiency. But there is technically more to the RISC/CISC definition than just instruction count stepping outside or RISC is really trivial. But some people consider RISC more of a design philosophy where one aims at simplicity in instruction calls and memory/IO structures. So to a degree ARM is somewhat still RISC. (Or at least that is what I think when I work on one of my own “RISC” architectures that clearly has strolled far Is it maybe more helpful to say e.g. load/store architecture (or stack-based architecture if that’s a key enduring design difference beyond “reduced”? but it isn’t a strict requirement. a RISC architecture can have no load/store instructions at all. Ie an architecture without any registers that instead only works directly on memory. Being load/store is pretty much the defining characteristic of a RISC style ISA.  One of the original arguments behind the RISC movement was that any instruction being able to access memory An ISA that only does memory-memory operations (e.g. TMS9900) would most decidedly be CISC. But if an architecture lacks registers (other than the program counter and state flags) then it can’t do load/store since there is nowhere to put that data. But if the architecture is still adhering to the other rules of the RISC philosophy then it is arguably still RISC. we could take the ARM core rip out the registers and append an address onto our instruction call for every register that we would have needed. The architecture would be fairly equal from a complexity standpoint. (Downside is the extra bandwidth needed in our memory/cache systems registers are common as mud among architectures for a reason.) We could make an even simpler architecture where every instruction call consists of an up-code followed by 3 addresses two input terms and an output. This can be kept the same for all instructions including conditional jumps and bitwise logic operations. Having hardware pointers would be a saving grace but lets not add complexity. The architecture would be RISC (as long as our instructions count isn’t huge and aren’t taking more than 1-2 cycles to execute) but it lacks registers and therefor isn’t a load/store architecture. the whole RISC/CISC debate is fairly polarized or one sided. Since everything that isn’t strictly RISC tends to be branded as CISC. Unless the architecture has a history of being RISC then it can be labeled RISC even if it is has drifted clearly into the CISC category. But then we have the people saying that modern x86 processors are RISC “under the hood” even if this is laughably incorrect in practice. Since x86 has a fair bit of more nuanced instructions that would take too many cycles to execute via microcode the throughput is too large for it to be an emulation running on top of a RISC core. (Not saying that one can’t emulate x86 on a RISC core but for peak performance and power efficiency under load it isn’t practical. The Intel Atom might though be “true” RISC under the hood due to it’s low performance and low idle power consumption nature. (RISC tends to win at idle power consumption why it is perfect for mobile  applications and other applications that are mostly idling and running on batteries.)) Another worth of mention RISC trait (and maybe its bigger advantage over x86-64) is the fixed length instructions that allow to build very simple decoders. M1 so far is the odd ball so shouldn’t be used as a generalized example.  The rest of the Arm chips only have 3 or 4 width decoders. see wiki under “Designed by ARM” Apple business model is actually kinda like consoles as they are vertical integrators operating differently than traditional chip vendor OEM integrators. They can and are throwing hardware at the problem.  They achieve low power and very good performance via massively parallel at low clock frequency. The fixed instruction does make it easier. BUT when you compared it to the extra chip space/complexity for the extra execuion units it is a small overhead. the comparison of 4 vs 8 instructions decoded per cycle is partly also missing the difference between RISC and CISC. The 4 instructions decoded by the CISC processor can produce a far more complex workload than the 8 instructions in the RISC one. We also need to consider what our instructions are doing when making the comparison. for workloads that aren’t optimized for the CISC architecture but instead relying on its simpler instructions then the RISC based architecture will tend to have an upper hand since it is easier to optimize for due to having fewer instructions for one to decide between. (Especially if one wants backwards compatibility to older processors.) I can beat the world’s best boxer if I tie their hands behind their back and glue them to a wall. (It isn’t a fair fight.) A comparison in performance and efficiency needs to show the best side of both. But even CISC architectures can have fixed instruction call length and still be CISC. The main reasons for why one isn’t always spending more effort on increasing decoding speed is due to other factors in the larger system already being bottlenecks. Ie a faster decoder doesn’t give any benefit and those resources can instead be spent on the actual bottlenecks in the system. For both RISC and CISC architectures one of the bigger bottlenecks to peak performance is the interconnect between memory and the CPU cache somewhat fixes this issue but cache have bandwidth limitations as well. CISC has the advantage that it needs less code to execute the same workload as a RISC architecture generally speaking that is. But a lot of RISC architectures have smaller instruction calls in general. Not to mention that it is common among RISC architectures to use microcode to compress common tasks into single instruction calls. (The decoder is though translating but the RAM and cache is non the wiser.) So these two things does close the gap a bit between RISC and CISC in regards to memory intensiveness. But depending on the CISC instruction the difference can still be large. But I also do have to point out. And Zen 3 has an 8 way L1 cache as well… So that isn’t particularly unique to RISC. (Though the cache implementation is fairly free from whatever ISA one uses though the ISA can have certain expectations that one generally should live up to.) > the comparison of 4 vs 8 instructions decoded per cycle is partly also missing the difference between RISC and CISC I’m not talking about the density but the feasibility of a wider decoder. Of course either Intel or AMD would make a larger decoder if they could. > The “4 way” part you mentioned in regards to AMD’s Zen architecture is the L1 Cache No: I mentioned the instruction decoder > And Zen 3 has an 8 way L1 cache as well Seem that you’re confusing the instruction cache with the instruction decoder that are two completely different entities hope this diagram will help: I would say rather than RISC it is now just a 1-address architecture versus 2-address. Or what the vocabulary deprived call a “load-store architecture” for some reason.  Plus ARM never had enough registers to fit among the RISC crowd (PA-RISC had 32/64 SPARC is 72 to 640 SGI had 32 64 bit registers and 32 floating point registers). the early ARM is a 32 bit 6502 (of course) with more registers. The instruction set is great and writing efficient code is easy. The amount of stuff that a single instruction can do in a single clock is pretty darn impressive yet not complicated to use in assembly. Good times. VLSI ARM7500 board from 1994 top image here “a 1-address architecture versus 2-address.” is interesting. RISC architectures tends to benefit from having a lot of general purpose registers makes it easier to implement code without having to worry as much about the data getting flushed away in cache or collide with other data if using global variables for data storage. But there is a downside with registers one needs to offload their content on a thread switch. The thread itself will already have some amount of data associated with it as is but with every new register that dataset gets larger and takes more time to store/fetch. (This is however fairly minior in the larger scheme of things and SMT makes this even less problematic. Unless one worries about it eating away fractions of a % of one’s memory bandwidth.) Another downside with registers is handling their content and switching it to our various hardware functions especially if we start doing out of order execution then things can get messy. you missed PowerPC on your list having a total of 64 registers. Half of them being float ones. it is fairly impressive what one can do in a single clock cycle when having dedicated logic for the function. Though one can need a clock buffer or two for stability adding additional cycles to the operation. But generally speaking one will tend to want to spread out the load execute and store into individual cycles regardless. And with out of order one tends to also want a queue somewhere around the load stage. I completely forgot PowerPC! Maybe because I never actually wrote anything low lever for one. And Linux users owe Device Tree and Open Firmware/Open Boot to SPARC and PowerPC Apples. out-of-order and pipeline tricks and context switching can take out the linear fun. In fact I avoided the Thumb set because of the way it diverged from the basic rules. I implemented a very traditional Forth on the ARM7500 and it was very fast and smooth. I recall that I found stacks so easy to use with stack pointers in registers that aside from a floating point stack I added several more to isolate things that normally were stuck on the return stack. Hmmm a loop stack I think and drat. Now I have to find the source code! Forth is rather straightforward to do a classic threading implementation with enough registers and the right addressing modes. I implemented one on a 6809 back in the mid-80s because the inner loop was literally two instructions and the U register was the data stack pointer. Found the old assembly code. The Forth inner interpreter is two instructions so it is in-lined in most places as a macro.  The stack pointers are as above. There was a significant increase in performance with the tops of the stacks in registers with 2 registers for the floating point TOS. The RISC as proposed by Hennesy and Patterson does not forbid more instructions. Instead it simply requires justifying every instruction by detailed quantitative analysis: new instructions have to be faster than their implementations put together with existing simpler instructions the complex instructions cannot slow down the entire design by e.g. introducing pipeline hazards or complex unwinding schemes. if a complex instruction can be shown to help the overall design it’s an entirely acceptable RISC. This is a good summation of the RISC philosophy. Are there any existing ARM based desktop base units or laptop computers or even just an ARM motherboard that support say 16 32  or even 48 GiB of RAM that can run an Open Source Operating System maybe with a few SATA ports and couple of actual USB 3.0 ports (not a USB hub chip) with at least gigabit Ethernet ? At a reasonable price basically a computer without an Intel Management Engine (IME) or an AMD Platform Security Processor (PSP). And do not even suggest an Apple M1 because the graphics processor is not using industry standards. Work is ongoing even with the major limitation of no documentation ( There’s someone on eBay selling ThunderX2 32 core 1.8GHz motherboards and CPUs for $999. I did not think to look for ARM servers gigabyte even ship a few motherboards with ThunderX2 cores via third parties ( That ThunderX2 chip reminds me a lot of the UltraSPARC T1 (from 16 years ago) or T2 or any of the later chips in that product line which were designed for maximum multi-threading performance it is a real shame that Oracle killed off SPARC hardware. Making your own processors had turned into the superpower arm race.  It was getting so expensive that few can afford to do and may bankrupt themselve doing it. Intel might turn into an investment company if they decoded to quit chip business…  :P Pooling R&D + production volume is the business model behind fabs and commodity parts. The “reasonable price” bit basically requires a couple of generations of demand-driven price reduction in an existing market.  At the moment the market for ARM has been generally limited to either high-end specialist hardware or low-end non-general-purpose hardware. Just like there’s no inherent reason you couldn’t have an OpenPOWER design for cheap except that there’s not enough market at current prices to pay for the production streamlining that would be needed to bring the prices down. although it won’t fit your requirements directly at least is demonstrating convincingly that “a reasonably architected ARM can indeed have compelling cost and performance advantages”. Maybe that will translate into enough market interest and competition to drive a low-cost general purpose system and maybe it won’t. I’m personally aware of at least two different companies with internal manhattan projects trying to achieve this so there’s at least some interest. Minor correction. “Fukagu” should be “Fugaku”. This is another name of Mt. Fuji. Methinks thou hast misspelled the name of the Japanese computer. That was a good spot  “Fukagu supercomputer” (wrong) should be “Fugaku supercomputer” (right).

Based on the type of search operation these algorithms are generally classified into two categories: the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked. For example: : These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in sorted data-structures. These type of searching algorithms are much more efficient than Linear Search as they repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. For Example: Linear Search to find the element “20” in a given list of numbers Binary Search to find the element “23” in a given list of numbers Sublist Search (Search a linked list in another list) Recursive program to linearly search an element in a given array Recursive function to do substring search Unbounded Binary Search Example (Find the point where a monotonically increasing function becomes positive first time) Why is Binary Search preferred over Ternary Search?

1620761336.5479019,51713749,https://hackaday.com/2021/05/10/south-australia-vs-too-much-home-solar/,South Australia Vs. Too Much Home Solar the consensus was that renewable energy was too expensive and in too sparse supply to be a viable power source to run our proud electrified societies on. Since then prices of solar panels have tanked becoming more efficient along the way and homeowners have been installing them on their rooftops in droves. Where once it was thought we’d never have enough solar energy it’s becoming all too much. In South Australia where solar output can be huge on a sunny day electricity authorities are facing problems with grid stability and are taking measures to limit solar output to the grid. The problem faced by South Australian utilities is one of how to properly control an electrical grid with many thousands of distributed power sources. Typically in conventional modern power grids voltage and frequency is controlled within set limits by carefully matching the supply from major power plants with the demand from users. Fast-response plants can be brought online to meet shortfalls and switched off when demand drops and everything hums along nicely. solar power isn’t so easy to throttle and even less so when it’s coming from thousands of separate households each with their own rooftop install and an inverter to feed back into the grid. This has led to authorities contemplating measures such as charging homeowners to export energy to the grid in peak periods in an effort to slow the huge uptake of home solar systems. Export limits have also been proposed for suburbs with the highest concentration of home solar as substations in certain residential areas struggle to cope under the huge inflows of energy. Wayne National Forest Solar Panel Construction 000 homes in South Australia equipped with rooftop solar or 35% of the state’s housing stock it essentially creates a huge power plant that authorities have little to no control over. In some situations South Australia’s energy needs have been 100% met by solar power alone wind and other generation resources then exporting their energy to interstate markets. Things can quickly become dangerous in situations where there is nowhere to export the excess energy however. In a recent incident interstate links were down for routine maintenance on a day of particularly high solar delivery. The electricity regulator made the decision to shut down 12 000 home solar systems via a newly-granted power in order to keep grid demand above 400 MW a level high enough that major gas plants could stay online. This was achieved through relatively crude means voltages would have risen high enough that home solar inverters would suddenly flick off en masse leading to a sudden drop in supply and widespread blackouts. The same can happen in the case of short-term voltage dips. If a major generator goes offline and the grid voltage drops below set levels thousands of home inverters can trip off suddenly in response exacerbating the problem and causing blackouts. Major blackout where large chunks of the grid goes offline at once are hard to come back from; black starts are stressful and expensive and avoided at all costs. Authorities are therefore taking measures to limit the chance of these problems in future. New installations are mandated to have inverters that come with voltage ride-through protection allowing them to keep operating through voltage perturbations to avoid sudden shocks to the grid. Additionally inverters that can be remotely commanded by the electrical authority controlled over the Internet or via 4G data links. Substations are also being upgraded with improved voltage management hardware to allow suburbs with high penetration of rooftop solar to better export their energy to the wider grid. too. Grid storage batteries like by storing excess energy when available for later use when the solar demand is lower. Home batteries could become an excellent solution in these cases as well allowing homeowners to make the most of their solar panel output even when the grid has had enough. These measures aren’t cheap at the moment and home battery penetration is a fraction of that of solar but government subsidies are in place to boost uptake. Home storage is best implemented in concert with grid control measures however else thousands of home battery systems going offline at the same time could present the same risk as home solar currently does. Additionally it’s not a panacea on its own – a long bright week in summer could saturate home battery resources. Such measures weren’t necessary when home solar first hit the market. The small number of homeowners with the hardware didn’t have enough generation capacity to sway the grid one way or the other. However since the number of home generators has taken off it’s become necessary to implement a way to command this huge resource. By implementing controls on home solar generators it allows the electrical authority to make the most of the generation capacity without placing the grid at risk of blackouts due to over- or undervoltage events. Having huge amounts of solar power is a great victory for renewable energy in the fight against climate change. However investment will be required for the electrical grid to keep up if this new technology is going to be exploited to the fullest. If home solar generators are going to provide Australia with electricity they’re going to have to work together. Building An Oxygen Concentrator: It Isn’t Rocket Science South Australia Vs. Too Much Home Solar They should use the surplus power to desalinate seawater into a reservoir. Or pump water to a higher place for generating power later Wouldn’t be the first time something like that had happened…. Who say’s ithas to be fresh water?  On the SA coast near to current wind farms we have lots of cliffs.  Create a salt water pond at the top of these are there’s your pumped hydro solution. or mine a lot of bitcoin This is an actual good solution. Easily scalable sets a nice cut off curve which is individualised. I.e. people will switch from solar to mining Bitcoin at different thresholds. this is a fantastic argument for a big hydrogen cracking plant. Or remove Co2 from the atmosphere Can we use the spare electricity to sequester carbon? but it would require a different payment model for solar producers. Australia copper or alumina refining can use all the “extra” energy anyone could ever generate. As a bonus the lack of conversion losses could cut conventional fossil fuel use and reduce the long-term CO2 cycle emissions. Desalination costs were a major issue in Singapore at one time too but the waste refinery energy eventually turned it into an exporter of fresh water.  As other posters noted even the highest quality reverse osmosis water purification plants use a surprisingly large amount of energy. I wish we had Australia’s temporary over supply problem domestically… ;-) You make a great point about aluminum production being able to absorb excess solar output. But it’s even better than that: use aluminum production to modulate ALL sources of electrical power as needed. Yes have the big smelters — all of which are in South Australia or Tasmania by the way — absorb excess power whether it’s solar OR keeping utility power plant output above a certain minimum. It’s doubtful that this would even require extra infrastructure since the smelters are already addicted to operation during cheap power times. Just change their tariffs to reward proper behavior. If that doesn’t do the job on its own the smelters can install battery capacity because they’ll make more profit by doing so. Though these refineries require a steady supply of power. Aluminum refining operates in a molten state and if it only gets power for a couple hours mid-day it’s going to be terribly inefficient if it can operate at all. which uses so much power that it appears on the AEMO generation map as a power station with negative output. aluminum smelting does not only run on electricity but it requires carbon as well which results in net CO2 output regardless as the cheapest carbon is source from fossil deposits (coke). That makes no sense. Why would it require a different payment model? When you sell something legal it doesn’t matter who buys it or what legal uses they use it for. You’re going to need some proof for that claim. Because the current payment model does not reward using the energy for sequestering carbon. or lift up big weights and use that potential energy when the sun isn´t shining but in the UK they are using rotating stabilsers which are basically giant flywheels to even out the energy We also use water for this Or have some system to crank every dedicated freezer to max cold during peak production and return to previous setpoint afterwards. Same goes for cranking water heaters to maximum safe temperatures during that time. All of these solutions are great but it ignores the fact that the excess power is created in localised areas (rather than across the whole grid). Reducing the localised supply is easier/cheaper than solving the problems with the lack of grid sophistication or building lots of distributed demand. What about build thermal storage in the same neighborhoods as where the solar is installed? It fits HVAC almost perfectly and is dirt cheap to implement. This is already happening in Hawaii. Now in some parts of Hawaii new residential solar installs are not allowed back feed the grid period. Enphase makes a special firmware for their micro inverters to achieve this. Excess power produced by residential panels is essentially curtailed at the residence which is a huge waste but won’t mess up the grid until something like pumped hydro mges or something like that can be implemented. I wouldn’t call it a waste if it’s going into battery storage and powering the house through part of the night. It sorta seems like this is one of those problems that’s only actually a problem in that it cuts into profits. I think the implication is solar installations need better infrastructure for grid control. Or the grid needs a better supply demand model.  Big planrs just can’t spool up or down all that fast and nobody is crazy enough to just rely on solar and peaker plants The supply side of solar is disconnected from the market by feed-in-tariffs so they don’t have to care what’s happening on the grid. Just push everything you got out through the wires and it’s somebody else’s problem – you get paid anyways. you don’t get paid for more than your total consumption (annually).  So if you make excess the electric company keeps it for free but you still paid for the equipment that’s generating the power you’re giving away for free increasing the time until you hit break-even. you can pile up subsidies up to 95-97% of the cost by combining various federal and county level tax credits including some infrastructure costs such as building a new garage or a roof underneath your panels. Some of these may not be available anymore since I last checked but the point is – if you’re rich enough you can get your solar panels essentially for free and then you get to offset your electric bill as well. So who cares about the duck curve? the solar tax credit will drop quite dramatically to 10% in 2022 and phase out in 2023. Businesses will still get 10% with an extra stipulation that the generated energy cannot be used to heat a swimming pool. you can roll your excess generation towards your next bill. If you do not state your wish to do so THEN the utility takes your power for free. “Net Excess Generation: Credited to customer’s next bill at retail rate. After 12-month cycle customer may opt to roll over credit indefinitely or to receive payment for credit at a rate equal to the 12-month average spot market price for the hours of 7 am to 5 pm for the year in which the surplus power was generated. (If customer makes no affirmative decision credit is granted to utility with no compensation for customer.)” “At the end of a customer’s 12-month billing period any balance of surplus electricity is trued-up at a separate fair market value known as net surplus compensation (NSC).  The NSC rate is based on a 12-month rolling average of the market rate for energy.  That rate is currently approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per kWh” Of course this incentivizes you to roll your credits over and use more electricity since the retail rate is much higher than the NSC – so you can ride free in your subsidized EV and turn the AC up without paying extra. I find the sketched cause of mass high voltage switchoffs incredible. Assuming 240V with a “10%” range the inverters will not all work at 263.99V and switch off at seeing 264.00V. Also due to transmission line resistance they won’t even see the same voltage at the same time. This creates a slow dropout of small generating capacity essentially keeping the voltage at around the switchoff voltage. The undervoltage is a different problem though even a minor sag in voltage can shutdown generatimg capacity which drops the voltage amd spirals into a gridwide brown- and eventually blackoit. Operating so close to the limits risks a transient event. such as shedding a large load or cutting a transmission branch will send a large number of generators over the limit and shutting down which changes the overall situation from an oversupply to an under-supply and the rest will follow to protect themselves. Why not implement some sort of random delay before switch-off in each inverter? Then some would drop off sooner than others and things would self-stabilize. +1.   And there you have it.  A really good solution.. That’s what “voltage ride-through protection” basically means. They slow the inverters’ safety function so it rides through transient disturbances in the grid without shutting down instantly. Of course that also means it does not react to real faults in a hurry and this may then continue to feed the fault and destroy more equipment because you can’t get the inverters to shut down. it seems like they could / should be designed to turn off immediately in case of  a gross over/under voltage but have randomly delayed response to smaller variations. Or maybe they already do I’m not an inverter expert It’s just kicking the can down the road. The problem is that there’s not enough flexible supply and demand on the grid with solar power producing way more than anyone CAN use at peak output so even as you relax the fault boundaries this will not solve the problem. It merely ignores the symptoms for a while until they add yet more solar power and then it’s banging against the new limits. Install window shades over the cells.  As the grid starts to reach it’s limits closing the vanes a little limits  the amount of energy the cells are able to generate. there may be issues to be overcome with the mechanical aspect of it moving parts that get dusty may start to fail or get stuck but nothing that can’t be dealt with. Another solution would be to switch off the output of cells as needed to accomplish the same.  Although I do not know if that would have negative effects on solar cells being hit by light and not being able to move those electrons along. That leads me to wonder how one could build a home system with an ‘alternative load’ (?) so when the grid isn’t buying any excess can be put to use. Maybe set it up to increase the output of the home AC raise the temp of the water heater by a small amount automate certain appliance cycles like the laundry or dishwasher or only charge the electric car when there’s a surplus of solar? It’s not like kinetic storage or water desalination makes sense at homeowner scale. Hot/cold storage is pretty much what you can do at home but there’s no incentive to do so because you lose the subsidies for power you don’t sell out and for heat you’re competing in price with gas which is much cheaper than electricity anyways. I see people in California buying solar panels to sell to the grid and then install gas power furnaces Do you have a reference for that?   In my experience (and with current legislation and power company attitudes) in California power companies will only buy the same amount of electricity that is consumed.  If you produce more than you consume power companies keep it for free.   Produce less than you consume and you get a big bill at the end of your annual billing cycle.  There is also the “All Electric” home initiative which is stopping/reducing gas powered appliances in homes. Why are so negative about home solar? The California energy model is Zero Net Energy (ZNE) and all new residential construction must now be compliant.  But like many things out of California the politics are subjective/emotional or don’t deal with technical (objective) realities.  They sue their own utility for causing a fire due to poor line maintenance and then reap rolling blackouts as a result.  Energy reliability is not their first priority.  They write feed good “visionary” policy in hopes that engineers will make it workable eventually.    Just saying that California is not the best model to follow. I’ve seen ONE person do it and then brag about the money they saved by going gas for the house and solar for the free electricity. because it’s a tax break for the upper middle class and rides on taxpayer money – a sort of reverse robin-hood scheme. It doesn’t really solve anything and it wreaks a havoc on the grid. And the net metering rules in California so allow you to cash in your excess production at the average market rate or roll the credit over to next year. See my reply to your comment above. So your friend owned a house spend a year running up a really large electric bill (setting their base consumption and base NEM limit very high) then installed a solar PV system then installed lots of gas appliances to reduce the electric consumption.  After a year get some portion of the base NEM purchased back.  While this sound possible it seems a lot of effort/money for what will be a small gain and that gain is unlikely to last more than a year of few. Say average home consumption is 20kWh per day.  And some how your friend manages to reduce their electric consumption to zero after installing a solar system that generates 20kWh per day.  This means that all generated power is surplus so the IOU pays $0.03 * 20 * 365 at the end of the billing year: $219.  Will that pay for the additional gas consumed? But next year (or after a couple of years) the IOU adjusts the base NEM to match the previous years consumption which was zero.  The IOU will now buy back zero of the surplus although it’s really happy to take anything above the base NEM limit (now zero) without paying for it. I don’t think they are going to benefit a lot and very likely to loose money over all.  Maybe it was just for bragging rights (or prepping). You seem bent on making home solar out to be evil but home solar has a lot of unnecessary draw backs put in place by IOUs that quickly mutes the benefits. what about all the subsidies going to the IOUs…  PG&E alone has had something like $200M in the last 10 years record profits in that time and still dodging doing proper maintenance and upgrades….. >some how your friend manages to reduce their electric consumption to zero That’s not what happened. You still need electricity for lighting and the TV etc. What did happen was the guy had gas water heaters etc. and then started bragging about how they’re running their house on solar and how cheap it is because they get free electricity. in reality they were running their house on gas and offset what little electricity they used with solar which is extremely irresponsible because their electric demands (mornings and evenings) was perfectly off-beat with their solar production so they’re not actually using any of it themselves. they made the economic case that solar power works for you IF you don’t actually use it. Having a system that would capture the daytime energy in hot water would have cost more than having an instant-on gas heater and a gas furnace. Extrapolate to other homeowners and you start to get the big picture – this is why in California they’re banning the installation of gas lines to new apartments. of course you don’t make much money by building more than your net metering limits. Yet everybody  who can does this: everybody wants to sell solar power to offset their net use but nobody actually wants to use the power they’re generating so you get the duck curve. The average producer rates are dipping to low $15/MWh in the middle of the day and up to $60/MWh in the evenings and the transition between the price regimes gets sharper and sharper every year with ramping requirements of a dozen gigawatts in just couple hours. You appear to be operating under the assumption that all of California runs on the same provider under the same rules. While I haven’t researched what folks under Edison pay your experience doesn’t match my own experience. I’m looking to put solar on my roof as my rates are roughly $0.28KwH right now. Most of that is for the fixed cost elements of transmission like wires; very little of that is actual power. I’ve been quoted a number of systems in the last few months and discovered some limitations I wasn’t expecting. Because until a few months ago I assumed the same scheme you describe here was the way “California” worked. 1) I can only install enough solar capacity to cover my average monthly consumption. This is a potential issue because I’ve been wanting to ditch my gas stove and go electric (they cook better.) However I’ve been advised to buy the stove first because adding capacity later is difficult to permit. (easy enough as a technical solution but not as a bureaucratic one.) 2) Solar power households must switch to a time-of-use billing system. (And in my city all citizens are being moved to time-of-use.) Peak power costs are 5-9pm M-F. Cheap power is all other times. During the Winter the sun sets too early to offset peak with solar unless you have batteries. And most families with two working adults consume most of their power M-F from 5-9. I’m quoted a breakeven point at roughly 5 years. The best and biggest battery I can get is the Tesla (or *could* get when I was quoted.) This sets a limit on an effective solar system to no more than I can pump into my battery each day because the price I get for selling power is not worth it. The battery I was quoted was rated at 13.5KwH. And my roof system was set to supply almost exactly that amount. 4) I’ve been considering getting a hot tub on a heat pump and using any excess power to generate heat for that. My new washing machine has a feature that lets it start on a timer or via app. Some solar equipment can now initiate appliances to consume power on demand. Selling power back to the grid at one or two cents per KwH and buying it back at 28 cents later in the day isn’t economically viable. The problem with the time-of-use scheme they’re moving us to is that it will encourage more gas appliance use for those that already have a gas connection–it’s cheaper to run and there is no variability in the price. But this is no surprise since the utility is “Pacific *gas* & electric.” “It’s not like kinetic storage or water desalination makes sense at homeowner scale.” As clean water becomes harder to find it just may. LCD layer(s).  This has that advantages of allowing for panel dimming and and adding a small load to the grid at the same time. There’s no negative effects. The panels just warm up slightly more when not in use. You don’t even need to go that far. You can throttle panels electronically by moving them to a less efficient part of the IV curve. But really the best solution is supply storage – throwing away free energy is just a bad thing. it isn’t really free – you already paid for it you’re just not using it storing the energy means paying even more for it. Significantly more at today’s battery prices. I mean at the grid level: from the grid’s point of view (if you think of the grid as “the aggregate consumer”) if supply’s so high it can buy energy for free… it should find a way to store it. All it does is just lower market price later. In my mind a lot of the problem is that there’s nowhere near enough incentive to push for grid-scale energy storage. At scale they should be *extremely* cheap – easily enough to put peaker plants out of business. There are *plenty* of grid-scale energy storage mechanisms (molten salt compressed-air) which can be either competitive with peaker plants if there were either subsidies/taxes pushing for it or even outperform them at scale. And of course grid-scale battery isn’t terrible either. the problem with any subsidy is that once it’s in place it’s very hard to make it go away unless you built in a natural mechanism to do so. (Which is why the pushback against tax/dividend systems is so effing annoying). but that’s still missing the forest for the trees. There’s no free lunch here: one person pays for the panels and puts out “free” electricity a different person pays for the batteries and buys the “free” electricity but the consumers will eventually foot the bill for both because the taxpayer pays the first guy subsidies to sell electricity at a loss and also the second guy to offset the cost of the batteries. There isn’t any technology presently available that would make grid scale batteries “extremely cheap”. Even at the cheapest it’s still going to at least double the cost of energy you put through it and that’s no good if you want to push for renewable energy all-day-round. and I listed several of them. Compressed air and hydro are already within spitting distance of gas peaker plants (less than an order of magnitude) enough that there are plenty of systems already built. Other systems (molten salt flow batteries) are close enough that there are projects in planning. A moderate tax/dividend system would be enough to tip the balance levelized electricity prices have been dropping for forever so it’s not like they can’t support a subsidy. >Compressed air and hydro are already within spitting distance of gas peaker plants The average baseload prices are in the neighborhood of $40-50/MWh while the break-even price for CAES comes in at around $100/MWh. Again not cheap. Hydro is nice and cheap where available but adding new capacity is a problem. The main issue for CAES (and molten salts for that matter) is the low efficiency of it. It’s throwing away roughly half the energy you put in which obviously doubles the cost of energy coming out even if the technology itself was free. I said *peaker*. Of course energy storage can’t compete with baseload. Peaker plants have a way higher cost and they’re pretty terrible carbon wise. You’re not trying to smooth *everything* out yet. Thermal storage is a few orders of magnitude cheaper than batteries and fits HVAC loads very well. This seems like a problem with how these commercial measures were implemented. If used in just a handful of cases this little ‘hack’ would have had little to no ill effects. But when lots of people did it the problems made themselves known. So it seems like the long-term solution would be to have something to store energy for non-peak (dark) times or to reduce our widespread energy usage to only when the solar panels are on. Eventually after we address all of the stability concerns we may be able to shut off those power plants for good but unfortunately I may no longer be alive then. This is an opportunity to examine issues that will be likely to generalized in the rest of the world as solar spreads. How the existing grid and the existing electricity producing assets (and workers) are allocated is just beginning to be examined and imagined. Throw in home storage huge solar and wind and storage farms and politics and you have a major human challenge. The driver is climate change and for large facilities lower cost for cheap solar and wind; and the resistance will be changing the infrastructure and manpower that currently exists. Thank you for being the tip of the iceberg. We need incentives for folks to point some or all of their solar in different directions. 10% E 30%W would be really nice to draw out production during the day. Either add incentives for installing panels facing those directions or change the price paid per kWh to favor morning and evening production. See below: pay market rate instead of subsidy – oversupply results in negative prices and people HAVE to re-orient their panels and install batteries or they’ll simply make no money. The best solution is to stop coming up with elaborate bureaucratic schemes and regulations and let the problem solve itself. California is already moving to this model with Time-of-Use pricing and limits on installed capacity. Here’s a though: stop paying subsidies (feed-in-tariffs) and instead pay the market rate: when the price goes negative people will automatically stop selling power to the grid. Then they have to buy batteries or find some other use for the power or it won’t be economically sensible to install any more. Problem averted. All these coping mechanisms and bodges on the grid to deal with this issue ARE the cost of renewable energy that people kept complaining about. This was simply swept under the rug by political means and now somebody else has to pay the cost while the people who install solar panels get guaranteed profits. Seems like the same people I know that are mad with the government ‘propping up’ this industry or that industry are A-OK with the ‘green’ subsidies… Keep the government out of it! Government has a legit role in creating new markets. Subsidies helped move solar and electric cars into more mature markets faster which improves economies of scope and scale and reduces prices to consumers. These subsidies are rightly diminishing over time as the market matures. Keep in mind that fossil fuels have a lot of external costs borne by residents that aren’t captured in fuel pricing or taxes including medical costs and the impacts of climate change. Subsidies to create improved technologies and markets that offset those external costs are a legitimate activity. If the government left the market alone we wouldn’t have electric cars right now. Tesla wouldn’t exist. The solar industry would still be too expensive and inefficient to make much of a difference. Capital only shifts to profitable markets; when was the last time a new industry was born without direct government involvement bearing the high costs of basic research and market development? boosting the green side via something like a carbon tax/dividend is pretty reasonable. It doesn’t make sense for a fossil plant to provide peaking capability if solar capability’s so high that you can do energy storage/recovery and balancing that way. In that sense taxing the fossil-generated stuff and splitting that revenue between the renewables makes sense.  Once you’ve got significant solar capacity you’d really like to be encouraging development of energy storage and this would do that. “Then they have to buy batteries or find some other use for the power” a lot of the problem here is that with distributed energy generation you *really* want more smarts in the grid-tie inverter and the solar setups in general. Throttling a PV panel is easy. Managing oversupply from panels should be a joke but the grid doesn’t have any control over them. installing carbon taxes creates a perverse incentive for the government to keep having carbon/fossil fuels around because it makes them a lot of money. Taxing is a poor way to control the market because the money doesn’t go away – the government uses it for something and then gets caught up in those commitments and then has to keep the taxes coming in to keep paying whatever. It’s basic crony capitalism after all. As long as the alternatives to fossil fuels and carbon energy don’t actually work well tax away –  the consumers don’t really have a choice and both the corporations and the government profit from it. The renewable power industry as well because they get to run a legal cartel with fixed prices to prop the whole business up as it would not work otherwise. Everybody’s just dragging their feet and pretending. Now why do you think we aren’t building any nuclear? Why is fusion research chronically underfunded? “Why is fusion research chronically underfunded?” really isn’t chronically underfunded. It’s practically like cancer research in the sense that yeah you can throw buckets of money at the problem but it isn’t going to make the hard problems suddenly have a breakthrough. and we really don’t know where the right points are in terms of size/scale/design. Especially right now fusion research is *exploding*. The theme of the game is that large budget projects like ITER suck up the public funding with project timelines stretching to multiple decades while small budget projects like the Wendelstein 7-X post results and progress but they’re slowed down by the lack of interest and funds. The fact that ITER was funded *at all* given the state of knowledge at the time pretty much counters your entire argument of “chronically underfunded.” “like the Wendelstein 7-X post results and progress” I mean… the W7-X is neat and all but you’re talking about an experiment with a fusion triple product ~2-3 orders of magnitude away from a viable power plant as opposed to tokamaks which are only about an order of magnitude or less. So I don’t get your point. The jump from W7-X to HELIAS (about a factor of 5-ish in scale) is *much* larger than the jump from JET to DEMO You’re welcome to have your own horses in the race for preferred fusion design but it’s hard to fault the community for coalescing on a JET-style design. So maybe in the end it’s “misfunded” but certainly not because of any nefariousness. except the triple product is a product of temperature and the W7-X is the only one that has shown the potential for steady state operation with no theoretical or technical showstoppers and has a roadmap for actually achieving it. Meanwhile the conventional tokamaks like ITER are limited because they’re unstable and nobody’s figured out the trick to get around that and even as such they’re still a decade out for completion at any rate because it’s a government-industry boondoggle. You need a triple product of around 10^28 while the 7-X has achieved 10^26 and it’s limited by the lack of cooling for the reactor walls so it can’t run for longer but they’re completing the cooling system and diverter upgrades this year and should resume plasma tests in 2022 with real steady state operation. If it works as planned and I don’t see why not they will have leapfrogged ITER by 20 years in proving that you can build a real fusion reactor. The next question is will they get funded for building another that can actually be fueled up and ignited? My guess is: no. It would not serve the interests of the governments or the other industries because it would disrupt the whole pork-barrel scheme going on around renewable energy. W7-X is a *concept* experiment to understand stellarator operation – it’s much more akin to JET than ITER (and the timescales of both explain *why* ITER is a tokamak). The scaleup from W7-X to an actual reactor (equivalent to reaching a DEMO stage) is covered well by and *includes* many of the materials issues that ITER is also researching. There’s no “leapfrogging” here. It’s not like the “stellarator people” walk over to the “tokamak people” and say “haha you suck” and walk away with the money. A *lot* of the ITER studies/work are directly applicable to stellarator design. Even if after the ITER stage they evaluate the W7-X data and ITER data and say “yeah commercial plants should be stellarator-based” the ITER research wasn’t “wasted.” Materials research diagnostics – all of those things still stay directly applicable. You’re confusing “ITER the machine” with “ITER the program.” “My guess is: no. It would not serve the interests of the governments ” now you’re well into tinfoil hat range. W7-X is a billion-dollar experiment. You’re not talking about some piddly little thing. It’s not like you just go “hey give us some energy!” Again – the scaleup to an actual fusion reactor needs *a ton* of materials engineering much of which is currently done under the ITER umbrella. but a reactor-scale device doesn’t get funded immediately. Why? Because it doesn’t make sense. You still need to wait for the materials engineering from ITER so it *does not matter*. It’s clear that you think a stellarator would’ve been a better design choice in the beginning. You’re welcome to that opinion but I *highly* disagree that that was forseeable 20 years ago. And the idea that governments somehow sent them down the wrong path on purpose (which… is the only conclusion you can reach if you think $50B was invested in a program that they knew was a dead end) is just insane. That’s why I said tax/dividend. As in suppose you tax the fossil providers 2.5 c/kWh. If the market price of electricity is and 50% of it comes from renewable (and 50% from fossil) 12.5 c/kWh and the fossils 7.5 c/kWh. As the renewable fraction goes up as the renewable fraction goes down the boost goes up. Naturally diminishing subsidy. It’s the same thing though. The people who get the dividend then depend on it. The more subsidies you pay to say renewable power producers the more they’ll drag their feet on actually improving the economics of production – in order to argue for the continued flow of subsidies. no one will actually depend on the dividend because you can’t do market prediction. The issues with the current subsidy-types are that the solar types based things on a constant income. Move away from that and it won’t be nearly as bad. the government does get something: they get to decide who gets the dividend and how much for what reasons… any way you try to dress it up it’s just the same tax and spend which is traditionally used to buy votes from the public and pay kickbacks to your business buddies. >because you can’t do market prediction You can predict a macroeconomic balance: the system will not eliminate fossil fuel production because the REE production depends on fixed prices. Shifting money from one to the other allows the renewable generators to exist as they do but as they gain in fraction they will lose the additional fixed transfers and new investments will stop. >but the grid doesn’t have any control over them. Because the politics doesn’t allow you to. The owners must be able to sell and collect the feed-in tariffs to recoup investment and make a profit. In many countries this is accomplished by writing explicit laws that say solar power has a right of way on the grid. Net metering also assumes that the utility will accept all power at any time. There’s also some politicians pushing for similar right-of-way laws as in Germany. I couldn’t find information about Australia but the general theme is that you can’t curtail and if you do curtail then you have to pay the owners a compensation for it which is stupid because you pay the solar owners to produce AND not to produce energy. “Because the politics doesn’t allow you to.” I’m pretty damn sure the reason is because last time I checked grid-tie inverters have a grand total of 3 connections and none of them are “please reduce the power you’re supplying.” There’s both a political *and* technological problem here. but here’s the main issue: solar power competes with itself. It has the unfortunate property that all the producers are on at the same time so the more you have on the market the lower the price will be. That’s why they can’t make ends meet without fixing the prices through the subsidies – the tax credits and feed-in-tariffs. If they can’t all sell as much as they can put out That is the main reason why there’s no utility side control options. I get the societal/economic problem but without solving the technological issue none of that matters. You don’t want to revamp the economic infrastructure and then have someone go “uh… now how do we do all that?” There is no technological issue. The technology to control generators with signals through the power lines themselves have existed since the 50’s if not earlier. They used to have those signal generators to switch between day/night metering in customer premises up until smart meters working over radio/internet came along. but they own the meters not the grid ties. I’m not saying you *couldn’t* do it but because they didn’t require it before they became everywhere *now* there’s a technology problem. We have a different understanding on the meaning of “technological”. In Germany they’re having mandatory retrofits for inverters in systems above 10 kWp for the same reason. Again not a question of technology. What % of cars in the grid area are electric? Quick search says there’s >2 cars per household so there’s the potential for about 100Kwh of storage per household sitting around. one problem though – during normal times said car is likely to NOT be at home when solar is at peak production. Furthermore – the car will likely require charging at night… So buy another car. One you leave at home charging during the day the other you go out in. Next day swap cars. please give me the money to buy the first! Sounds like you need a govt subsidy. the planet’s dying. Fix the grid so we can actually take advantage of all this rooftop solar instead of coming up with convoluted ways to cut off solar producers and keep fossil fuel plants online. Or we could just stop messing around and build nuclear. Try to find more than 5 sites that were actually successfully reclaimed after a reactor was decommissioned.  The dirty secret is the cooling ponds contain a 1000 to 15000 year depleted fuel problem no one wants to pay for have in their back yard or even partially recycle in many places..  it will still be your great great grand kids problem. Traditional Nuclear fuels should be reserved for space travel projects… where the waste can be dumped where no one will ever live. I am sticking with my vision of a future filled with wifi enabled goat-carts prediction for now as it is far more probable than viable fusion power in our lifetimes. Many/Most of the existing nuclear power stations were built primarily to produce fuel for nuclear weapons and only produce power as a side effect/excuse.  If we build modern power stations for just energy production then we could have much cleaner nuclear power than we currently experience. the terrible CANDU reactors we have domestically use many types of fuel and no one here would ever tolerate nuclear weapons.  In fact we burn most decommissioned Pu for countries like the USA trying to lower global tensions as a general policy (arguably with mixed results). Thorium reactors are still not a real option yet did you know that goat carts get 0 mpg fuel economy. ;-) no. That applies for the RBMK series reactors (Chernobyl…) which were pretty much a scaled up plutonium breeder connected to a turbine. I’m not letting you get away with this one. I’m tired of people spreading personal-opinion information such this and expecting it to be believed AND because it makes a good ‘sound bite”. HIGH-QUALITY ATTRIBUTIONS FOR YOUR CLAIMS For your information: no one would be more excited than I to see proof of this. Absolutely true. here is a list that has 13 just in the US… Modern designs and technologies like Breeder Reactors leave little transuranics and vastly reduce the waste and the radioactivity of said waste. You can even run them off the ‘waste’ of the arcane 1970’s reactor designs we are forced to run. Do you really need people to run down the list of contaminated/leaking sites (even the ones hidden on google maps)?  I am sure those giant tanks of Uranium hexafluoride are even safer now than decades ago. ;-) moving the problem around in rail-cars doesn’t really solve anything. Thus we will have to agree to disagree on this technology If your scientific hubris is still stronger than your sense of survival one could always dig for clams near the Hanford sites drainage run off.    Building something to remain waterproof for even 30 years has proven difficult and no one has ever really solved the problem economically. Goat cart for the win again… did you know most goats are still safe to eat but I will concede the cart is less edible. ;-) Exactly. The free market HAS spoken and it’s wishes are solar. The utilities must adapt or be allowed to fail. THAT is what the market wants and the market wants to make sure they’re not screwed over in the process. There’s no need to prop up dying systems at the expense of our planet. Another option are rotating stabilsers. Basically giant flywheels that can be spun up with over capacity and give off electricity when production slackens. They have just finished installing one in Scotland (although to be fair probably does not have the overcapacity solar issue as southern Aus) Not to put too fine a point on this but this is a problem which should have been (and by the manufacturers and vendors of the solar power industry. It only takes someone of slightly higher than simian-level IQ to anticipate this as a real consequence of feeding power back into the existing power grid. The manufactures had to have known this would be a problem and instead of investing in a solution their responsibility and decided to pass it on to the consumer will be forced–through governmental regulations and solutions imposed on the power companies–to pay. Perhaps it’s time to devote as much energy to all possible consequences of a problem’s solution as it is to the solution itself BEFORE an industry is allowed to offer for sale a product or solution which has far-reaching consequences. –to sign on for this approach. This strategy does this is precisely why flow charts in the world of writing computer programs–it’s just not the sexy thing to do; and it’s very hard to convince the end user to pay for such frivolity. There is a sign posted on my desk: “Why is there never enough time to do it right the first time but always time to do it over?” What?! More like imposed by the power companies. This is only a problem for their bottom line. Power is mooved by advancing phase not increasing voltage. There must always be a refrence and stable phase source to work against so a generator is a must. Phase control capability shoud be installed in every solar inverter and controlled by the power company via power line signals. Thus the grid stability can be balanced against the generator’s ability to retain phase control without changing frequency. It works both ways. Technically speaking to advance the phase you must push the voltage up ahead of the grid… Seems to me (from my lofty perch here in N.A.) this is probably the best problem they could have. I’m curious how many of these systems have battery storage and how many are exclusively grid tie? If grid tie install battery’s and forgo connection to the utility. Of course your mileage may vary federal policy’s and laws. My system is not now nor will it ever be grid tied. Screw them…. I prefer to be as self reliant as possible. this story just underlines what I’ve been saying for more than a decade – that ‘the grid’ as currently implemented is largely an anachronism. Sure it may be needed for heavy industry and possibly a few other corner cases. But by and large we should be redesigning infrastructure around local power self-sufficiency. Segments of grid infrastructure would still be useful for allowing areas experiencing temporary power problems to get power from surrounding areas; but on the whole neighbourhood-sized areas should be self sufficient when it comes to power. Yes there are challenges around keeping things in phase in case one power area needs to be bridged to another – but these days that should be an easily solvable problem. And wouldn’t it be great to have major winter weather events NOT knock out power in a large portion of a continent or in most of a state the size of Texas? ‘Cascade failure’ would no longer be a term commonly applied to power generation and distribution. neighbourhood-sized areas should be self sufficient when it comes to power. but that is only practically attainable if you have a gas turbine or a diesel generator in every neighborhood. It doesn’t work with intermittent and non-dispatchable renewable sources. Wind power has to be far removed from habitation by necessity and solar is only available through parts of the day The Levelized Cost of Energy numbers for grid scale solar plus battery (4 hour storage) are competitive with all forms of fossil fuels. The issue isn’t intermittency any more but a grid sophisticated enough to handle a more complex mix of sources and consumers. Is no one else looking at the security of this. Controlling large amounts of power via 4g. What happens when the network goes down. Are they updating firmware when vulnerabilities are identified. This is silly. The problem was seen many years ago and solved. If the production of solar increases the line frequency will also increase. As far as I know every solar inverter in Europe will slowly reduce its output if the line frequency gets too high coming to a full stop at 50.2 Hz. Instead of a problem it is now a nice way of stabilizing the grid. (Grabs popcorn while patiently waiting for the inevitable rant by Dave Jones at EEVBlog) I see a lot of comments here about addressing or what is thought to be addressing the issue but it comes down to this in a nut shell. The power grid is no where near close to being maxed out 90% of the time. WHAT it truly comes down to is this. The utility company has to pay for the power which is not generated by them but by a producer such as a gas fired coal fired or nuclear plant or from a hydro plant on a river which has been dammed. The utility companies do invest in wind solar and sometimes they do invest in some of the others but for the most part billing agencies. They purchase the power and distribute it to the regional local consumers and maintain the local grid which is a subsidy of the national grid which has been funded by the Government ! Production plants have also been funded by the Government and contracted by firms that maintain them. Take Hoover Dam for instance that was such a massive project the only way it could have been undertaken was through Gov. backing. Same goes for most other high capacity plants like nuclear and the only way those could be completed is through Gov. inspection and regulation. The problem with the renewable grid system is that when people are producing the required power they need and or production exceeds demand on the system the renewable is connected to the utility company sees a reduction in revenue and this to them is almost unacceptable as they cannot cut back on wages and operating expenses. Therefore they suffer a lose of profit. Here’s how it works solar production works on a gradual cycle little power in the morning and evening no power in the night! Cloudy days make fluctuations an issue for sure. Grid tie inverter systems are unstable in such a case however and granted utility companies can run into fits when everyone is producing and then no one is producing. For this reason a smarter system is absolutely needed. Since grid tie systems must monitor utility line conditions from the start they have to in order to connect or they would simply NOT work and or cause unsafe circumstances with the power system. Next point as is mentioned in one post causing an issue with the frequency solar has NOTHING to do with FREQUENCY or voltage for that matter grid tie inverters run in sync with line frequency or they could not be grid tie period. Line voltage is controlled by the inverters with set perameters in the sycronous inverter which is what they are they sync with the line voltage and frequency before they connect the solar output to the utility line and when that happens the meter either runs in reverse or stops metering power fed to the  load circuit the consumers appliances. I haven’t been involved in this for a while lately however I do know that when I was involved the utility required a contract with the owner of the backfeed system and the meter monitored output from the renewable the utility companies meter and the owners meter the utility company would read both and adjust for the difference in what consumer used and produced. Truly the best constructed system would be set up with a multiple system which would store excess current for later use and limit what is fed back into the system this is not hard to do either. All it would take would be system utilizing a limited inverter output and another inverter/charger to make use of the stored power in time of higher demand. It would necessitate a switching system in the fed line which would really not do anything more to the grid load than as when a heavy load for a particular facility does when suddenly switched on and there are devices to condition this also. As I said earlier when everyone has a solar system installed and the power sales goes down the utility firms are going to have done implementation of policy to limit the public from cutting into their revenue. It’s the only way they will be able to stay in business they must produce and sell or they go out of business. Let’s put them out of business. If they can’t or refuse to adapt they must cease operations. A company’s profits should not be our reason for maintaining a failing and outdated system. Just give people big subsidies to install home batteries in the areas where solar overproduction is a problem. Which is largely paid by people living in areas where solar overproduction is not a problem or who have nothing to do with the whole situation? Who will benefit from the solution by the subsequent lowering of prices during peak and off-peak hours as the batteries feed into the grid at steady rates. Who can ALSO buy solar and batteries further benefiting from the same system. Nothing South Australia does matters much they have a population of less than 2 million people.  They have very high insolation levels too so they are as irrelevant an example as you can find if you are looking for case studies that apply to the rest of humanity. The trouble is simply that batteries aren’t yet cost competitive – over their life cycle. It costs more to put the energy in and get it out again (divided by how often you can do it and the battery cost) than what buying electricity from the grid is – last time I did the numbers in Aus. What most of my friends do (in the sunny parts of australia) is put the solar up use it to run the central air con do the washing etc during the day – and export a small amount to the grid. Then use the grid at night (when the air con isn’t working as hard etc etc) as their battery. They normally end up with about a zero usage bill – but still the fixed cost service fee (which is quite high in Aus). The other option – which I’ll do when I retire to my holiday house in the tropics – is put a relatively small battery on and either disconnect the grid entirely (a few of my friends have done that) or have the grid as a separate backup – ie you have to go out and throw the switch to connect it if your battery is flat because the wet season rain has come for three days.. I mean there are plenty of places in Aus with more than 300 days sunshine a year We were sold the incredibly annoying on-sellers of electricity as being market driven and therefore innovative and flexible. Financial losses are supposed to stimulate innovation.  Seems like BS.  Market loss stimulates political intervention so that they can keep making a profit they way they always have. if the idiots running the state and country try to charge me for export it will just be an incentive to go off grid. There’s a lot of hype around the negatives of solar at the moment as the federal government is firmly behind their mates in the fossil fuel industry. I’m currently running a 1st gen Tesla Power wall and 3Kw solar which is enough to cover 90% of my power usage. In summer I utilise the excess power by remotely turning on my pool pumps and solar pool heating when the battery is fully charged. In winter I just run the pumps for a reduced duration once the battery is full. If everyone went for solar and battery setup the power companies would go broke this is the real reason for the negative hype around solar in South Australia. If the grid and large generators keep screwing around trying to pass their failing off onto the consumers they’re going to see people buy storage systems and abandon the grid entirely. Then they’ll realize they should have done something else when they’re all facing bankruptcy. I say let dinosaurs die. If they don’t want to pay for power they’re using cut them off. Again we have the masses subsidizing massive corporations who ignore the failing environment. Time for them to close up shop. When they say they want to use things like 4G to signal back-feeding on or off I always scratch my head. Can’t they just modulate a signal into the power line itself? I’m sure there are complexities I’m missing but I don’t see how it would be any worse than a 4G modem the success of solar has presented some near term challenges but also tremendous opportunity. With differential pricing based on demand homeowners (or businesses) with batteries can make money buying and selling power. Then there are the businesses that can regulate their usage to take advantage of the low cost “excess” power. It’s not a problem of too much solar Please be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent. ( This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Some of you are already yelling something about or reinventing the wheel — I hear you. But at least sometimes there’s a good enough reason to reinvent the wheel: let’s say you want to learn something. Mike and I were talking about a cool hack on the podcast: a library that makes a floppy drive work with an Arduino and even builds out a minimalistic DOS for it. The one thing that [David Hansel] didn’t do by himself was write the FAT library; he used the ever-popular by [Elm-ChaN]. Mike casually noted that he’s always wanted to write his own FAT library from scratch just to learn how it works at the fundamental level and I didn’t even bat an eyelash. Heck if I had the time I’d want to do that too! and you’ll see tons of hacks where people reinvent the wheel. In this [Michal] spends a while working on the IR protocol by hand until succumbing to a library that has it all done for you. But if you read his writeup he’s not sad; he learned something about IR protocols. This is nothing if not a reinvention of the I2C wheel but isn’t that the best way to learn? Yes it is. Think back to the last class you took. The teacher or professor certainly explained something to you in reasonable detail — that’s the job after all. And then you got some homework to do by yourself even though you were probably just going over the same stuff that the prof and countless others have gone through. But by doing it yourself even though it was “reinventing the wheel” you learned the material. And I’d wager that you wouldn’t have learned it without. when the chips are down and the deadline is breathing hot down your neck that might be the right time to just include that tried-and-true library. But if you really want to learn something yourself you have every right to reinvent the wheel.

Want this type of article to hit your inbox every Friday morning? Using CanoPy To Visualize The CAN Bus And do not forget that that wheel looks like a hexagon and with some thinking and work one can devise a better In the venue of the article and code libraries just because there is a library  wouldn´t mean it is written in the best way. One may need to reduce size and so reinventing it may be necessary. Tabletop gamers know this to be true. Re-inventing the wheel is the best way to learn about wheels. Reinventing humanity is the best way to… and it’s what the human genome project is all about. Imagine when we start coding human DNA. I’m sure there will be libraries for eyes and noses and other body parts even for the garbage that holds it all together. Then some people will want to go in and code a human all by hand from scratch. patent that “human” and market them as slaves or soldiers And then realize they reinvented Philip K. Dick’s science fiction…. It would be easier and more profitable just to charge all the existing humans a licensing fee for using their own DNA.  You know the drill:  “If you don’t agree with our terms and conditions you must immediately cease using DNA sequences covered by our patents.” “Re-inventing the wheel is the best way to learn about wheels.”  Hmmm. That is quite a claim. Wouldn’t inventing the wheel tell you that wheels suck without bearings and balance and strong materials and light weight and an understanding of friction? You are likely to wind up with a child’s toy and continue to use your wife as a draft animal dragging a couple of sticks. “She great woman! Strong like bull!” I almost always reinvent the wheel.  That is because it is all about the journey and not the destination.  For me.  If it was about the finished project I would use short cuts such as existing libraries.  Maybe even some prefab IDE But it is really about what you enjoy spending your time doing.  My goal is usually understanding all about what makes it work not just making it work. Sometimes I want to just get something done — and then I just buy a decent product and get on with life. “What I cannot create I do not understand” – Feynmann “If you want to make an apple pie from scratch…” for each project i always struggle with how much of the wheel to reinvent.  like now i’m reinventing audacity.  i feel pretty solid about that decision.  but for the UI do i want to reinvent SDL 1.2 and use libX11 directly?  it’s a struggle. for a lot of modern stuff (say i feel pretty good about reinventing the wheel.  a lot of times if i’m frustrated with a library’s interface then when i look under the covers i see wrappers around wrappers around wrappers.  endless sophistication to achieve simple results.  so many libraries these days spawn a bunch of threads simply to avoid exposing a good interface to developers.  you get two or three of those wrapped around eachother and you wind up with a single event that gets passed through 5 different semaphores in 5 different threads before it gets to you and because of the kind of interface it is you have no choice but to send it through another semaphore!  if they could admit they mandated pthreads then the innermost layer could have just exposed its semaphore and i could have sem_wait()ed on that.  but they want to pretend it’s an asynchronous event coming in to a callback magically from nowhere without defining the thread semantics of it so we’ve got this nightmare. but the real part that gets me comes down to Val’s feynmann quote.  a lot of times not a single one of the layers is properly documented.  if there’s no unnecessary wrappers then you can just read the code and figure out what it does.  but if you have a library that is undocumented and it is just a wrapper then you have to peel that back…and then the thing it wraps is not documented and is itself just a wrapper and you have to peel that back.  you have to peel back 3 or 4 layers to find the code that does anything.  unnecessary wrappers really increase the cost of poor documentation.  so just to use the outermost library with any confidence i have to peel so many layers of onion to figure out how it works…once i understand it i really should reimplement it.  i replaced tens of thousands of lines of code spread across multiple libraries with just a thousand lines that i wrote Here’s a hint: if you program your GUI using X11 you know how to make an application that runs in Linux or Unix.  If you program your GUI using SDL you know how to make an application that runs in Linux and other programming environments.  That’s just an example though.  I chose SDL2 because it only goes as far as finding a common environment that abstracts out all of the difference between systems.  It’s kind of the “C” of user interfaces in that it only abstracts as far as necessary to provide a common environment.  And while I sometimes find myself wanting to re-invent C I have an internal alarm that usually stops me.  At one time (before SDL2 came out) I wrote a similar shim that made the three OSs I needed to work with (Windows and *nix) all look the same.  Now I use SDL2 because OTHER PEOPLE are spending the time to maintain that.  So when Apple comes out with a Retina display and does some weird scaling operation _I_ don’t have to figure out how to work with it.  As long as I’m not in a hurry.  SDL2 still doesn’t seem to have that one quite right.  Thanks or is there some other library with similar name ? it seems it is mostly oriented at games ? That’s the one I’m talking about.  I rejected SDL 1.2 because it would only do one window because it WAS designed specifically for doing games.  But this didn’t even allow your program to create dialog windows which was just not adequate.  Sure you can emulate dialogs by overlaying something on your one window but that really IS reinventing the wheel.  SDL2 is definitely suitable for writing any kind of application. >that abstracts out all of the difference between systems All of it? Like the different UI paradigms I choose what I want to look like the platform’s customary way of doing things and my own way.  Look at what Firefox does: it does everything the Mozilla way with the only platform-dependent things being things like file save dialogs.  As for different screen shapes and resolutions that’s not what I’m talking about.  By “all look the same” I mean that I can always use the same functions to determine what the screen dimensions are and to resize my application’s windows. oh yeah i agree if portability were a concern for this project i’d use SDL (or some other library).  but i was just thinking about it i’ve made probably a dozen programs that use SDL and not once have I run it on something other than xfree86/xorg and Linux.  i’ve never even run it on a device that doesn’t support 24bpp.  all of its generality is wasted on me.  i do have some complaints about SDL but i am not denying its many valuable features! maybe someone can help me with this.  i have only done a little digging (and the digging was frustratingly difficult one of the strikes against SDL) but it seems like on linux it is very hard to get SDL2 not to try to use GL even if there is no hardware accelerated driver.  so while SDL1.2 would use X SHM for basically framebuffer-under-X SDL2 would do the same trivial blitting operation but through MesaGL in such a way that it is dog slow if you don’t have the (often proprietary) hardware drivers.  so in my experience SDL2 actually runs well on a much smaller subset of platforms than SDL1.2 did. but i don’t know if there’s a good way around that or not i didn’t get to the bottom of it.  and i’m curious about other opinions. I have had uniformly poor results when using SDL 2’s preferred way of doing graphics – I think they bit off too much there.  Sometimes it does strange things and other times I just get nothing.  The good news is all of the 1.2 stuff is still there and still works but you do get the 2.0 advantage of being able to open multiple windows. Knowing when to “just use the library” and when to do it yourself is very hard and probably also very dependent on the project you’ve got and the state of the mythical library. I usually find out halfway through the project that I should have done it the other way.  :) we used OpenSSL.” And that wasn’t even really the wrong decision for the affected software. Protip: do NOT roll your own encryption library. I don’t mind reinventing the high-level stuff because sometimes that’s completely bloated and not a good fit for my applications.  Take Qt they’ve already done everything for me but writing a Qt application means subscribing to the Qt religion.  Once you go down that path you need a deprogrammer to ever get out.  I don’t want a GUI toolkit that lays out my user interface for me because I probably won’t like the way it arranges my controls and widgets.  I DO want a toolkit that lets me use the same API whether I’m writing for mobile devices or desktop machines. I would probably write in assembler if it weren’t for the fact that I would have to know a dozen different assembly languages to handle targets from AVR and PIC and 8048 through x86 and more.  Which is why I write most things in C.  Anything that’s beyond easy reach of BASH gets done in C.  So similarly for user interfaces i want JUST ENOUGH abstraction to make all machines look the same. ” I don’t want a GUI toolkit that lays out my user interface for me because I probably won’t like the way it arranges my controls and widgets.” Writing for your desktop? Fine. Writing for everyone else? That’s what all those GUI guideline books are for. Look and feel. Which would be a valid argument if Qt was following all those GUI guideline books. Particularly aggravating is how Qt reinvents sockets. Idk maybe they’re nicer than the old BSD model if you get used to them. In my experience though when your networking isn’t working their wrappers just seem like more hindrance than help. Definitely use Xlib. It’s a major fail of the Linux community to dissuade people from using this straightforward and perfectly good library. That’s the one thing that kept the Linux community from building quality desktop software and instead cursed the platform with slow brittle bloatware. Xlib is simple and effective and unbelievably similar to WinAPI. You can write a wrapper for each platform in a few dozen lines and never have to worry about platform dependency. sure you can.  And spend the rest of your life dealing with edge cases.  Don’t ask me how I know. i agree with tetsuoii and BrightBlueJim! i’ve used libX11 a few times and it’s not nearly as bad as its reputation.  but also it really doesn’t hide any edge cases from you…they’re in your face all the time.  SDL1.2 is easier to work with if all you want is a framebuffer.  but also if all you want is a framebuffer it only takes a couple hundred lines of libX11 code to completely replace SDL (ask me what i did this weekend).  so far all my libX11-targetted programs are for myself so it hasn’t bothered me that i’m not sure how they’d work on other cromputers with other display drivers and window managers and so on.  but i do have one libX11 program from 2007 that has worked effortlessly ever since.  and another from 2003 that only has one flaw after all those years the font library (Xft) has somehow drifted so all the fonts are scaled about 2x what they should be. the few GUI programs i have written for other people have been javascript/HTML or java/Android.  and those platforms have actually both given me a *lot* of trouble in terms of API drift and needless bugs from customization of local viewers.  so i really think libX11’s acknowledged downsides are much less than the unacknowledged flaws in many of the supposedly portable / high level solutions. fwiw i settled on xcb for this project.  i’m pretty frustrated by its documentation but it’s easy to work with anyways.  the thing that inspired me to avoid SDL turned out to be a non-issue so probably it was a mistake but the xcb part is 99% done and i’m happy with how it’s working. I completely agree with you. Things have been made unnecessarily complex by people out there. These days there are hardly any organizations not writing wrappers around core logic/features. This is precisely what sucks most of my energy and the intention to produce good and well-documented code. Amen!  I once had to dig all the way down to a hardware abstraction layer to discover that it was generating a fake PID by truncating the current value of the system clock.  The e-mail application built on top of this abstraction layer was generating temporary file names based on the assumption that the PID was unique so not unsurprisingly users periodically found themselves reading other people’s emails. I often find that existing frameworks and libraries etc are very generalized. Sometimes I just want a very specialized case and if it’s something easy to handle it seems cleaner to roll an application specific implementation than to wade through gobs of configuration steps in code and/or messing with compile and link options. Nevermind when the 3rd party wants runtime .conf or .ini files. And that is why I seriously hate C/C++.  Messing with compile and link options to add a library shouldn’t be a thing. The fact that it still is makes me think the devs don’t actually want you to use too many libraries and making it easy isn’t a priority. Luckily it’s no trouble in Python and JS! “I hate using apples to drive in nails it’s much better to use a hammer” Sure you have to know your compiler and linker but that’s what it takes to build quality software something only C can deliver. When the rubber hits the road all other languages eat dust. My philosophy has always been: Why re-invent the wheel when you can steal a hubcap. In more mundane terms: Copy the essence Because a hubcap does not make a very good wheel?  You’re kind of arguing against your own point. If everything in your project is a wheel you might just have a pile of old tires. if you already chose your hubcap you probably now know exactly what wheel you need. When something sounds wrong it often implies a lack of imagination. And of course when something sounds just right it can also imply a lack of imagination; something I’m often reminded of when trying to use libraries in embedded programming. What’s so bad about reinventing the wheel? You may discover the pneumatic tire. I remember one of the pundit columnists (might have been Jeff Duntemann?) writing for Dr Dobbs Journal back in the 90s saying something like ‘If a program or library is not well-enough documented then a programmer will likely rewrite their own version’. I wouldn’t even have to try to read the code before deciding to roll my own! If I want to deeply understand how something works If I actually want to ship something before the next decade I used to be incredibly anti-NIH as a badge of honour (what kind of cretin has to use a library and can’t roll their own?) but reality beat that out of me. making wheels more efficiently is something completely different. If you can make two wheels that look and behave exactly the same but the reinvented wheel only requires less of the effort and/or resources to make then that’s the better one. And the true beauty lies in the fact that in many cases nobody will ever notice they just think you are a bit silly by reinventing the wheel. Reinventing the wheel might be great as a learning tool It happens a lot in coding subreddits where pros and students share a space.  You’ll get people arguing that C is a great language because of how much you learn. That doesn’t make C an good language it makes it a good set of dumbbells and you might even hurt yourself and learn terrible ideas if you aren’t conscious of the habits you are picking up. Standards are often better than anything you can do simply because they are standard and will be compatible people don’t have to learn a new thing they’ll never use anywhere else Simple and understandable doesn’t make it good.  A lot of the time it means limited to one application and not reusable(And therefore does not benefit from large community support) and it often can’t handle real world edge cases. I don’t care how beautiful the code is if it segfaults on an invalid file I’d rather have the 10 year old industry standard that I can treat as a black box even though the code is probably repulsive. as long as you don’t carry over that same kind of attitude to real ones.  Scientists love original ideas.  Engineers should be suspicious of them till they are have proven to be robust. so many things to agree with phrased in a subtle way to make me disagree strenuously :) you really should shape your decisions around the real needs of your project but i absolutely disagree with the idea that real projects and learning are different.  learning is just a project with different priorities. but like any other it has costs and rewards. i agree with you there.  when there’s a good standard i am extra hesitant to reinvent the wheel.  the wheels i’m most interested in reinventing the interface isn’t even documented simple and understandable DOES make it good.  there’s nothing else that makes it good.  simplicity and undestandability are the only virtues in software.  everything has bugs.  the hypothetical example of dirty code that doesn’t crash and clean code that does is bogus.  the dirty code crashes too.  the difference is you can fix the clean code but the bugs in the dirty code you just learn to live with.  if you’ve already learned to live with those bugs you can convince yourself they don’t even exist. scientists and engineers both love new ideas and they are both skeptical of them at the same time.  i don’t think differing attitudes towards new ideas is a difference between scientists and engineers.  scientists can definitely fall victim to NIH causing them to ignore previously discovered truths and once they invent something that same NIH can make them blind to newly discovered truths.  scientists can be just as territorial as anyone else. but i really do agree with your fundamental claim you need to know your context.  sometimes it’s acceptable to incur the costs of rewriting the library and sometimes it’s acceptable to incur the costs of using a bad library.  and sometimes the library is such a great fit that there aren’t really any costs.  depends on what your goals and requirements are. “…you need to know your context. sometimes it’s acceptable to incur the costs of rewriting the library and sometimes it’s acceptable to incur the costs of using a bad library. and sometimes the library is such a great fit that there aren’t really any costs. depends on what your goals and requirements are….” I’m not so convinced that clean code is guaranteed to crash less than the dirty code. Typically code gets uglier over time specifically because 100k edge cases get added along with a million features. But the clean code is effectively “hiding” something because all those edge cases have been moved into documentation The dirty code knows that sometimes people use one specific API that returns bad data if you are on one obsolete OS.  The clean code just trusts that you give it the right thing and might even silently corrupt data if you mess up bad enough.  It knows that for some reason you can’t display one certain color of magenta when using one specific other program.   It knows all kinds of dark knowledge that should not be needed but were at one point The clean code can be understood but the price is that it *requires* you to understand not only the code itself but all non-ideal parts of the system it’s attached to. and making them mostly work requires a lot of effort and that kind of dev effort only happens on really massive reusable one size fits all projects. from the hardware right on up to the training program for the users and what tools the devs use because you can make it so there are “Obviously no deficiencies”. complexity seems to be way more reliable and often way easier to understand than the usual approach of documenting limitations instead of adding special case code to fix them. It’s like the GUI vs the CLI and how many disks have been wiped by a mistyped command or the supposed robustness of ethernet over Wi-Fi which totally disappears if you can’t run a cable in a safe way that won’t get unplugged or trip someone or both. Complexity is almost a prerequisite for anything to truly be a black box solved problem and black boxes are a big part of division of labor in mega scale software. I suppose a lot of people are working on things with real novel algorithms that aren’t largely just UI so perhaps there’s a huge class of cases where simplicity is great that I just haven’t encountered. But it does seem like a lot of practical things that haven’t already been done are either inherently insanely hard or there’s really nothing to them except a few bits of UI code and any wheel reinvention will double or triple the effort and half the portability and performance. if your “clean code” ignores flaws in your underlying libraries then you’ve got dirty code in the libraries.  clean code is a very lofty goal and can’t be achieved by sweeping things under the fridge.  the trade offs we’re forced to make in practice are intense and can’t be ignored just because one component is readable.  which i think is your point so i think we agree. I’ll be blunt.  Blaming C for programmer errors is stupid.  Yes there are bad habits that C won’t do anything to prevent you from developing.  But programming languages that won’t let me do something efficiently because the developer of the language thinks I don’t have the self-discipline or maturity to be responsible for my own decisions is downright insulting.  If you want to make a tool that I can use to examine my code for hazardous practices go right ahead – I may even use it.  But don’t tell me I can’t do something because you don’t think it’s safe.  That is what many “modern” languages do.  We have many many devices that have inherent hazards.  We don’t outlaw stoves because you can burn yourself on them. I don’t really need to defend my use of C but since I brought it up I will: C is the language that does best exactly the thing I want from a programming language: providing just enough abstraction that I can use the same language to program a wide variety of underlying hardware.  I have used a number of other more sophisticated languages and found that NONE of them gets the job of creating code done faster or prevents me from making errors and ALL of them produce slower-running code often orders of magnitude slower. If you want to use a hyperbolic variable-slope rowing machine with the built-in AI personal trainer module but don’t look at me when sits there unresponsive declaring “error 63289” in flashing red comic sans on its high-definition screen.  I’ll stick with my dumbbells. i generally agree with you here and personally use C for nearly everything.  but i have a surprising counter example.  i implemented something in ML (using an ocaml compiler) that i had previously written in C and it was faster even though the ML implementation was *much* cleaner and simpler!  ymmv but you will occasionally have an experience like that in a non-C language.  some of the functional languages have really slick compilers and so long as you’re careful not to needlessly create and destroy lists (which they do make attractively easy) they really can have good performance. but people sometimes say stuff like that about java and it’s all rubbish.  no matter how careful you are those languages will always have abysmal performance and the surprising thing is that it’s usable but it never comes close to parity with C :)  even C++ you hardly ever find a performant program in the wild. fwiw i haven’t tried rust yet.  the limitations of its build environment overcame me. We don’t outlaw C either.  We may someday when Rust catches up but for now… C is everywhere and nobody complains except when it is used for stuff other languages do better. How many lives per year would be saved if stoves had auto shutdown with thermal cameras to catch unattended pots before they can burn?  I would be all for that kind of tech. I don’t know who wrote every line of code I use. And for any application I actually have any interest in using I most likely am not going to make time to read a bazillion lines of it myself. Even within a company people can’t read all the code. And there are varying skill levels. Basically no software that I want to use can be understood by one person because only very minimal stuff can be like that. If you are using C for something performance critical or something so small you don’t need advanced features But OS bugs happen all the time.  Clearly coders as a whole cannot be trusted with large projects and need as much help as possible from the language. Or maybe you can be trusted but… Job interviewers aren’t perfect. I don’t know that the people who make SW i use are as good as you. And  I would much rather make an error impossible than have to constantly be on the lookout for it. I wonder how many injuries could be prevented by adding AI to dumbells that gave you audio feedback to perfectly optimize your acceleration profile playing an ugly noise if it detects the wrong kind of forces? but the average person does. I’ve reinvented the wheel many times when I only need a small portion (or single function) of a library for a quick script and hacking my version together can often be quicker than learning the API of another library.

Taking waste energy from the exhaust and using it to cram more air into the engine they’re one of the best value ways to make big gains in horsepower. unlike simpler mods like a bigger exhaust or a mild cam swap a turbocharger install on a naturally aspirated fuel-injected engine often requires a complete replacement of the engine management system particularly on older cars. This isn’t cheap leaving many to stick to turbocharging cars with factory tuneable ECUs or to give up altogether. In the 1990s aftermarket ECUs were even more expensive leading many to avoid them altogether. Instead enthusiasts used creative hacks to make their turbo builds a reality on the cheap and there’s little stopping you from doing the very same today. The best solution is to use an aftermarket ECU for full control over fuel and timing but this can be cost prohibitive. The reason a turbocharger install typically necessitates an engine management overhaul is due to the need to vastly change the engine’s fuel and timing map. A stock naturally aspirated (NA) engine with fuel injection can measure the incoming airflow and load on the engine and uses this information to determine the correct amount of fuel to inject and when to fire the sparkplugs. the pressure in the intake which is usually below atmospheric pressure for an NA engine becomes positive under boosted conditions and this can completely confuse a stock ECU. At best it reverts to an “open loop” control method ignoring its pressure or airflow readings into the engine. This uses a base table to decide how much fuel to inject and when to fire the ignition based on engine RPM and throttle position only. With the turbocharger forcing much more air into the engine than expected by the ECU the air/fuel ratio will be severely lean in which the air/fuel charge in the cylinder detonates instead of burning at a smooth constant rate. This can damage or destroy an engine in short order. A typical rising rate fuel pressure regulator. The two ports on the back are the fuel inlet and outlet while the port on the front is the boost reference connected to the intake manifold. to properly run a turbocharger on a formerly naturally aspirated car it’s necessary to inject more fuel to match the added air forced into the intake. This is where the power gains come from after all. The best way to do this is by using a custom ECU that allows full control over the fuel and timing maps. This allows the engine to be tuned to deliver optimum performance right up against the limits of detonation and damage there are other more rudimentary ways to get the job done — increasing fuel flow and controlling timing — without going to the trouble of a full ECU replacement. low-tech solution is known as a rising-rate fuel regulator. Such a regulator increases the pressure in the fuel rail in proportion with the boost level. This is often done at a ratio — for example a 10:1 rising rate regulator will deliver an extra 10psi of fuel pressure for every 1 psi of boost. The higher pressure causes the injectors to deliver more fuel for the same duty cycle. This makes it possible to increase fuel flow into the engine as the turbocharger spools up and delivers boost without having to make any changes to the fuel map in the stock ECU. These devices can be had cheaply often with a variety of swappable diaphragms to change the ratio and tune the fuel delivery somewhat though with far less finesse than a properly tuned fuel map. The Apexi Super-ITC was a popular ignition timing controller from the 1990s. The high cost of aftermarket ECUs in this time period led to the popularity of such “piggyback” solutions. there are a few options available to avoid detonation. On cars where such adjustment is available the cheapest method is to simply wind down the base timing of the engine to a lower level. This will keep timing lower across the board hopefully avoiding detonation when running at high RPM and high boost levels. However this means that at lower RPM and lower load situations the car will be running with suboptimal timing and will sacrifice power and drivability and likely cause the engine to idle poorly. This can be acceptable for cheap race builds but may be frustrating for a street driven car. can be wired into the car. These consist of a microcontroller that monitors signals like intake air temperature engine position and boost. When the timing box detects boost it intercepts signals from engine position sensors and spoofs them back to the ECU offset so as to change the time at which the ECU triggers the ignition pulses. Popular models include the Bipes ACU for the Mazda Miata for a broad spectrum of JDM cars. Often these timing boxes were also used to tune turbocharged cars running larger turbos and other major upgrades. Timing boxes usually offer some degree of tuning via DIP switches which can be set to determine the exact level of timing retard desired to keep the engine out of detonation. ECU Swaps Have Become the Preferred Hack One thing you’ll notice when researching these devices is that the vast majority of forum posts regarding the technology date from before 2005. This is because as technology has progressed aftermarket ECUs have come down in price enough to make them a more attractive option. The capability to properly dial in a fuel and timing map versus trying to push and prod a stock ECU into delivering huge amounts of extra fuel and less timing generally leads to a car that drives smoother and is less likely to blow up. It also is a lot easier to tune. However these parts still have a place in the scene. They’re used for the absolute lowest-budget builds such as the Broke and Boosted project in racing series like the 24 Hours of Lemons which feature restrictive budget limits. These techniques are also relevant to supercharging NA engines as well as turbo builds on carburetted engines though substituting rising rate regulators for A modern engine management system may be the most reliable accurate way to tune a boosted engine but it’s not the only way. However don’t expect to get much help from the broader automotive community if you attempt such a build. The tricks and techniques have largely been consigned to the dustbin of history so you may find yourself poring over old manuals and having to troubleshoot blind. But if money or simply the sheer thrill of doing things the old fashioned way put you in that situation we hope this guide gives you the best possible shot at success. Good luck Hackaday Podcast 117: Chiptunes In An RCA Plug How To Build A Turbo Car The Cheap Got me a megasquirt opensource ECU for my project car back in the day. Worked like a charm! same here! Best learning experience to get into engine management systems! Excellent documentation for many vehicles! Years ago I looked the Megasquirt .. some of the worst spaghetti code ever. I remember your code was a lot cleaner and worked much better. Mine’s still running happily after almost 20 years… speeduino is tho! I’m running speeduino on a supercharged G13 Samurai as a daily Megasquirt started out as totally open but as more money got made they have gradually closed shop – these days it may as well be full commercial as it’s near as makes no practical difference. When mine dies I’m looking closely at Speeduino even though I am not a fan of Arduino. GNU-style open source; the earliest version of the website had a FAQ about whether you could build a copy with no parts from Bowling & Grippo and the answer was “Our lawyers can beat up your lawyers.” Most of what’s happened since has been being more specific about what the policy means rather than changing it. Speedduino or RusEFI. Maybe cheaper than rising rate fuel regulator and other crap that will give you poor output from your engine. Those ECU’s only work in certain common engine “scenarios” since especially 90’s ECU systems have a lot of quirks in design and implementations that require lots of effort and firing the parts cannon loaded with new sensors to compensate coupled with pretty much redoing the wiring harness. rusEFI has run everything from a kick-started 2 cylinder russian motorcycle to a dual drive by wire BMW V12.  Along with tons of Miata 4cyl mercedes 4cyl and LS engines.  90s engines aren’t terribly more heinous than what followed with only a select few exceptions IMHO. I think you’re taking guff there fella – those ECU’s will run almost anything as will almost any aftermarket ECU these days. Spark boxes & rising rate regulators on the other hand are sticking plasters at best bodging around the problem rather than doing it properly with a new properly tunable ECU. I think it is generally illegal to tamper with the stock ECU due to EPA regulations.  If I’m wrong I’m sure someone here will chime in and I don’t mind.  The problem is that swapping out the ECU may change the vehicle emissions.  Hacking the stock ECU software/operating system could also change the emissions.  I have read that changing the ECU software also is illegal because of copyright law but I doubt that since you aren’t distributing copies.  BUT it is highly unlikely you would get caught doing any of these things.  A deputy performing a standard traffic stop would not look for such modifications know how to investigate or even care.  I wouldn’t worry about it. Until an insurance claim happens. :) Depends on where you live. Germany does have police officers who are trained for modifications as an example. And all cars undergo a safety and emissions inspection every two years. It’s illegal for STREET USE unless the modifications are EPA and/or CARB approved but if it’s a dedicated track car you can do whatever you want at least in the USA The irony is that unless there’s an exemption the track cars will then have to be towed to the track causing even more emissions. Perhaps it would make more sense to build an EV and not have to deal with emissions anymore… Usually you can get registrations permitting you to drive to/from a track or organized meet but it’s something that has to be planned and coordinated I’m reminded of the famous VW dieselgate models of a few years back.  If anyone purposefully builds a Jeckell and Hyde setup please use a large red button to initiate beastmode.  :) @Troy K Ryckeley – my 2004 opel astra has “sport” mode button which does nothing I would gladly hook up some real function to that. Swapping out ECM if and when it is possible shouldn’t affect emissions as the ECM must measure O2 in the exhaust however there is some software obtainable for some systems to make modifications such as remapping the timing and fuel maps adjusting transmissions shift parameters and tweaking RPM limits. Most factory ECM’s have speed controls which can be over ridden. Many times the re programming changes the engine temp operating range for improved performance engine temp is a critical factor where it comes to keeping the intake air temp down which helps control detonation. When an engine is expected to make more power it makes more heat so lowering the operating range give a margin of safety when more heat is being made. Hacking vehicle ECM’s only becomes a problem when that vehicle is in a dealership and someone runs a scan of the ECM since to hack a controller requires a license pass code there are some software programs out there that you can purchase for various vehicles giving access to the EEPROM to re flash them. One example was when Ford came out with their earlier EFI small blocks the factory ECM could be adapted to about any V8 engine as it would supply fuel to any displacement simply by reading air flow and  RPM. Also early GM systems like those found on Oldsmobiles with the none fueled throttle bodies could be adapted. Those were bank fire meaning half the injectors were fired at the same time then the other half only 2 channels and a really simple system. The MegaSquirt MS3 system a DIY has so much customizable options and is about the best budget you can find. MegaSquirt has expanded their offerings to cover about every design out there when it comes to building an aftermarket system. They can work with throttle body in about every cylinder configuration invented including rotary engines up to 4 rotors. They can be configured to run fuel only or fuel and timing sequential and in 2 stage with coils on each plug. The software that runs on their processors is about the most advanced there is. None of the EFI systems for aftermarket as far as I know are approved for on road use but since most are being slated for vehicles which are not under the Federal Emissions Regulations anymore on account of their age and intended use. When engines are swapped from a later year model the installed systems from the factory usually go into the older vehicle which the Government will accept it’s when an older engine that doesn’t meet newer standards goes into a newer vehicle that doesn’t usually happen. The neat thing about some EFI control setups is that there are companies that make systems that just piggyback into the factroy ECM’s so if you live in a place that requires inspections the performance box can be removed and the system goes back stock you just run a risk of getting caught in between inspections such as was mentioned in foreign countries. Now when it comes to Germany they are so into hi perf to start with even stock vehicles run a cut above the rest of the world. You can have your choice of old lady cars or sports versions but we all know that. The nice thing about being able to re flash an ECM is the police will have a harder time picking this out since nothing gets changed under the hood that makes it stand out unless you dress everything up but that can be done without altering any emissions. As someone who has worked in the performance aftermarket tuning cars for the past 15+ years I have to take issue with much of what you say. Megasquirt is old and tired.  They have not kept pace with advances in technology.  If you really think their software is “about the most advanced there is” take a look at the Motec M1 build environment allowing more or less full customization of both the algorithms used to manage the powertrain but also CANbus vehicle connectivity for integration.  MS can’t even touch the feature set of some of the more advanced open source projects.  It’s tired.  It still works fine for many setups – but those setups haven’t changed. Reflashes (and altering the tunes on factory ECMs in general) almost always have an impact on emissions.  Recently organizations like the SEMA Garage have made it possible for smaller/independent entities to rent time in a facility that is capable of making all the measurements necessary to comply with CARB/EPA testing.  The amount of work in the performance aftermarket is huge compared to the tiny sliver of truly emissions compliant aftermarket tunes that happen.  Not attracting attention of law enforcement or other compliance entities and actually being able to walk the walk and pass a test are two very different things. one of the points that I hammer into students heads is that the optimal conditions for fuel economy emissions and performance are NOT THE SAME.  The possibility of performance gains in almost every factory car (and current performance aftermarket) exists because the priorities of the original manufacturer are almost guaranteed to not be optimal performance.  Change priorities etc.) are used by smaller manufacturers for things like marine applications and powersports.  Some companies like Bosch who make ECMs used in major manufacturer’s vehicles use the same/similar technology in products they sell for motorsports. (Bosch Motorsport MS4/ME7 etc.)  It’s entirely possible for a “non-OEM” ECU to pass emissions compliance but I’d be shocked to see it happen because of the different priorities of automotive enthusiasts and the amount of work required to get emissions right far far exceeds what is required to make a car “drive right” and make power. those are some great tips for ECU products. I’ve been working with EFI-Ignition which is based on the mega squirt but is more of a rounded product. Have been looking into different manufacturers for the next project. Tell that to Volkswagen… No tampering! Here in the UK its legal on older cars grey area on newer cars as the annual MOT inspection has an incresingly strict emissions test that would be very hard to pass with any significant modification. I might have a few corrections to that. With the installation of a turbo most airflow meters will happily tell the ECU the right airflow since they’re sitting just after the filter box. It’s just that the Fuel-Tables (3-axis table) don’t have target values for the measured airflow. It will top out at maximum available airflow values and just apply the fuel target values for that which will result in a very lean mixture and therefore a blown engine. Then the fuel thing…a turboed engine will need higher fuel pressure depending on boost levels. Basically the only way to get that is a boost referenced fuel pressure regulator which you refer to as “rising rate fuel pressure regulator”. It’s not an option it’s the only way. Additionally you’ll also need uprated injectors since the N/A ones won’t be able to flow the necessary amount of fuel no matter how much pressure they get. And an uprated fuel pump which is able to provide both the pressure and the flow. Without those three things the mixture will be lean and the engine will knock its rods out. Changes to the fuel map are a must as a result of all of that. But then again they’re highly recommended even if all you do is install an aftermarket intake (Cold-Air-Intake) since it will result in the airflow sensor providing incorrect values. Many older or simpler engines only have a manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor and no Mass Air Flow (MAF) sensor. 1989 Ford Mustang 5.0.  Mass air flow model Most Japanese cars from about 90 to mid-2000s also go on this list of MAF no EGR. Even the turbocharged ones though they do use boost-referenced mechanical fuel pressure regulators. Watching 24hr Lemons is the best! Change or blow out all the dust in her air fliter your car will breath much better Is an intercooler mentioned? you will need to fit that into the intake airstream cools the hot air down somewhat… Get a Renault Fuego…. they did it right Intercoolers are heavy and introduce turbo lag – Colin Chapman in his Lotus Esprit Turbo from what for I know about turbos they still might could be makeing them inFrance but only Germany has the Autoban Stupid question; why not place the TB it’s maf and it’s temperature sensor before the turbo? In 1973 I put a huge SU carburetor In front of my old corvair turbocharger and water injected it through a football inflation needle. Then I built a water cooled adjustable waste gate. The car was stupid fast. I drove that car that way for 9 years crossing the entire US 4 times flat towing cars planes and campers at a?steady 80 mph. So if it worked before the turbo so well why wouldn’t it be the same for modern stuff. Granted the FI pressure would have to be bumped up to over come boost. I don’t see it done but this old hotrodder can’t figure out why. Please help me understand. I’d definitely put the temperature sensor after the compressor or charge-air cooler if equipped with that (since hot air is less dense and in edge cases be part of the causes for detonation) preferably in the intake manifold itself. Generally there’s a lot of nervousness about having significant volumes of fuel/air mix because of the explosion risk if there’s an intake backfire.  My friends who have done carb-supercharger builds are quite definite about intercoolers being totally unsafe with this topology so if you really want a charge cooler you’re stuck with fuel mixing downstream of the compressor.  (Where it’s somewhat of a better fit as the fuel evaporation helps cool the incoming charge more when it’s hot.) Your question has a couple of parts that you seem to have intermingled. F1 in the 80s *did* run throttles on the inlets of the turbochargers.  I think this was to try to keep the shaft velocity up on the turbos but I’m not 100% sure.  The larger volume of air between the intake valves and throttle plate with a pre-turbo throttle would probably make for rather different transient dynamics than the small volume with a more traditionally placed EFI throttle.  Independent throttle bodies (which have incredibly SHORT distance between intake valve and throttle) are known for having very fast transient throttle response.  As a driver transient response is generally desirable. MAFs typically end up closer to the intake manifold in order to only meter air actually going into the engine.  One of the “weaknesses” of most MAF systems is that the assume that ALL air which travels past the air meter will eventually end up in the combustion chamber.  If you let the air escape after being “metered” but before entering the chamber the ratio of fuel to air tends to be richer than intended because the computer calculates fueling from ALL the air it inferred was going into the cylinder.  You could move the MAF pre-turbo (and this is sometimes done – see Nissan SR20DET for an example) but it is usually paired with a recirculating compressor bypass valve so that the system remains sealed.  So why not put sensors pre turbo?  Flexibility in plumbing bypass valve time lag between sensor reading and air arriving into the combustion chamber. Water injection is still used with fuel injected vehicles.  The NACA reports documented its use with piston aircraft engines rather well.  Many aftermarket water injection systems are available today. I’d love to see more pictures/details.  Draw through carb setups are still seen rarely today.  Sounds like a neat setup. Water injection to provide non-oxygen in the cylinder to prevent detonation for lean fuel-air ratios? Mostly thermal.  Huge specific heat huge heat of vaporizatoin.  Formation of H3O+ and OH- ions is a rate limiting reaction for a lot of the larger combustion reactions.  2H2O + a whole bunch of ionizing energy (spark) equals a whole bunch of hydroxide and hydronium.  The NACA reports and their meta analysis cover it fairly well. These predictable worried lawful neutral comments….this is hackaday. Stop worrying so much about the law. What law? Here in the UK I just need to have no visible smoke at idle. on a lot of classics going EFI from a crappy old carb setup you can gain power and have better emissions than the car ever did from the factory. >ECU for full control over fuel and timing but this can be cost prohibitive $200 ECUMASTER DET 3/EasyEcu MICRO say what? btw both made in EU/Poland. Screw EFI. Carburetors in my opinion are better. When running a rising rate regulator it is also good to run a bleed valve ( boost controller) on its signal line so you can bleed the boost signal at full boost to tune the amount of fuel. Some times a rising rate regulator will be just too Ritch. “The best way to turn what would ordinarily be a high-mileage naturally-aspirated internal combustion engine into a piece of junk in less than seventy-five thousand miles. Reliability is right down there with that other internal-combustion-engine engineering marvel foisted on the general car-buying public–the rubber timing belt.” Remember the Mercedes 300D? Non-turbo. Regularly achieved >500k miles with no maintenance other than routine oil–and other ‘consumables’ –changes. Darling of European taxi drivers. Mercedes issued BADGES to be placed on the cars’ grilles to advertise every new 100k-mile increment achieved. There were a LOT of 300Ds one DOES GET a healthy increase in power over the non-turbo version..for the short time the engine lasts. Turbocharged engines are the only type engine Volkswagen knows how to build I had a 1982 Fiat 2000 Spyder (124) turbo’d from the “factory”. Fiat outsourced it to an aftermarket company who literally put a boost controlled switch in the coolant circuit that would trick the ECU into thinking the car was cold for cold start enrichment. It would just dump fuel in. Not efficient but safe for the engine. A common improvement to this system was to remove it and just run NA. it reverts to an “open loop” control method ignoring its pressure or airflow readings into the engine.” Open loop is where the ECU stops looking at the Output Sensors..  It still needs the Gross Input Sensors to approximate How much Air has been injected at what RPM so it can delver the ‘Proper Fuel’ and a Spark it timing delivered from it’s Base Map with no feedback from the Output Sensors.

Since then he has grown Lifehack into one of the most read productivity health and lifestyle websites in the world - with over 12 million monthly readers. He has been listed as Business Week's #4 ""Top 24 Young Asian Entrepreneurs"" is now widely recognized as a productivity and management expert through his pioneering work at discovering applying and spreading the secrets of personal development to the world. Leon began as a software engineer at Red Hat where he was quickly promoted as a manager overseeing a team of mixed nationalities engineers. It was not long before he realized that simple hard work was not enough to cope with the increasing complexity and workload. Before ""leverage"" became a common business buzzword Leon was finding ways to go beyond his ""fixed ability"". To level up his productivity he invested heavily in reading books on productivity and management testing them himself through trial and error and realizing which techniques actually worked over others. It was at this time that he began to discover ""lifehacks"" which were (at the time) simple tricks and methods to increase productivity. Using these lifehacks to vastly increase his performance Leon quickly outpaced the demands of his work and by his mid-20s had already successfully managed over 150 engineering projects. In the span of less than 5 years he had achieved more than what other project managers could do in 10. After compiling an immensely valuable treasure trove of productivity tips and methods Leon decided to summarize his experiences and publish them online. This is how Lifehack was born. Leon quickly made a name for himself and the initial popularity of his shared Lifehacks was overwhelming because it addressed a common need that all people share in the world - not having enough time. This response made Leon realize that climbing the traditional career ladder wasn’t his true calling. There was a new mission - to positively influence more and more people through this knowledge - Leon quit his job to found his first company and became an entrepreneur dedicated to Lifehack and fulfilling this goal. Leon has pushed Lifehack to expand beyond its initial boundaries. From simple productivity hacks Lifehack now covers almost all aspects of our work and personal lives including health parenting and productivity. Lifehack has linked up experts and contributors from all over the world to share their valuable knowledge and experience and Leon continues to lead it forward from the helm discovering better ways With over 12 years as a leader Leon is still just as passionate about pushing his limits and sharing his secrets about personal development as he was when he began. Through Leon's efforts today Lifehack is a world class team that still retains its start up mentality where he has personally coached over 70 executives to make personal breakthroughs at work and at home. He is a valued guest speaker and contributor and has been featured in multiple publications including at the UC Berkeley Hass School of Business Harvard College in Asia Program besides being recognized as Business Week's #4 ""Top 24 Young Asian Entrepreneurs"". Leon spends his spare time coaching his 2 sons preparing them to be the next generation of productivity gurus.

Because Dell has patched their driver but hasn’t yet revoked the signing keys from the previous driver version it is open to a BYOVD attack. Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver is an interesting approach to Windows privilege escalation. 64-bit versions of Windows have a security feature that blocks unsigned kernel drivers from the kernel. The exploit is to load an older known-vulnerable driver that still has valid signatures into the kernel and use the old vulnerabilities to exploit the system. The caveat is that even when a driver is signed it still takes an admin account to load a driver. So what use is the BYOVD attack when it takes administrative access to pull off? but we can speculate. The particular vulnerable driver module lives in the filesystem at a location that is writable by any process. The likely attack is to overwrite the driver on the filesystem then trigger a reboot to load the older vulnerable version. If you’re still running Windows on your Dell machines then make sure to go tend to this issue. . Where previous versions leaked data via cached memory this iteration leaks memory through the micro-op cache. I’ve often joked that x86 processors don’t really run the x86 instruction set they emulate it. It’s partially true as part of the execution pipeline is translating the x86 macro-ops into processor specific “RISC-like micro-ops”. This translation process has the potential to be a complex operation so modern processors have a cache to avoid repeating the process for repeated instructions. working from the University of Virginia and University of California . There is some disagreement about the seriousness of this new technique with the researchers claiming that they can bypass all the current built-in Spectre protections. Intel has stated that the new technique does not bypass their existing mitigations and AMD hasn’t yet made a statement about the paper. Time will tell how much work will actually be needed to mitigate yet another problem with speculative execution. bring a trio of serious bugs. is a set of problems in how the Android system handles NFC tags. Invalid NFC messages could result in a double free and memory disclosure. The primary solution appears to be just dropping NFC packets that don’t appear valid rather than trying to handle them anyway. are both problems in Bluetooth handling. These are both pretty simple. The first is a easy-to-do coding error: checking a packet’s length using member is fixed — they really want to just read the value. The second Bluetooth bug is a pair of missing leading to a use-after-free when hitting certain error conditions. The insanity that is octal-formatted IP addresses appears to be the gift that keeps on giving and this time it’s the Python library. Just over two years ago changed to tolerate a leading “0”s in IP addresses this leads to confusion between the different layers of an application where a security check might allow an address that is understood as a different address when it is acted on. The Python devs have gone with what I consider to be the correct solution: invalidating all IP addresses with leading “0”s . The octal address format was never RFC compliant and should be avoided anyway. We’ll likely return to this story multiple times as I’ve been told that several other languages and libraries have the exact same problem. It’s a trope that we normally laugh at when the geeky sidekick hacks into a house’s security system to disable it from afar. But apparently in the case of an ABUS Secvest system A Secvest system needs port 4433 forwarded to the system in order to manage it from the internet. [Niels Teusink] points out that this is an advantage in that the system can be remotely administered without relying on a cloud system. The downside is that this HTTPS interface is particularly broken. Multiple endpoints on the system can be accessed without authentication including one that dumps the system configuration. Included in that configuration data? The cleartext user PINs needed to control the system. many systems are configured with Dynamic DNS. The update credentials are also in that configuration data so not only could an attacker disable the system he can also take over the Dynamic DNS name to play a loop of uninteresting video whenever the owner tries to pull up their cameras remotely. It’s a hack worthy of a bad Hollywood blockbuster. The Exim mail server was started in 1995 as a Mail Transfer Agent for Unix machines. Qualys audited Exim . Qualys calls the result 21Nails as there are 21 serious vulnerabilities found in the effort many of which existing as far back as the git history of the project. While the report doesn’t include PoC code they will likely be quickly developed independently so if you run Exim go update your servers now. we have a big problem in ExifTool: Anyone using ExifTool make sure to update to 12.24+ as CVE-2021-22204 can be triggered with a perfectly valid image (jpg mp4 and many more) leading to arbitrary code execution! patch makes it fairly clear what was going on . Strings with special characters were handled with a combination of regex and an statement. That last technique is almost certainly the problem. If an attacker could inject Perl code into the string being evaluated and escape the “quotes jail” (shout out to then running arbitrary Perl code is trivial. This one has the potential to be really problematic as ExifTool likely runs on the backend of many sites pulling metadata out of uploaded images. Any such site can now trivially be compromised by uploading a trapped image. Pocket Sized Wii Sets The Bar For Portable Builds >I’ve often joked that x86 processors don’t really run the x86 instruction set e.g. 68xxx FPU emulation for a processor is done in exception handling when it encounters an instruction that was meant for the missing FPU. Modern processors don’t actually execute the x86 machine code directly anymore. There is a front-end component that dynamically recompiles them into RISC micro-ops. This is literally an emulation technique “There is some disagreement about the seriousness of this new technique with the researchers claiming that they can bypass all the current built-in Spectre protections.” and of course people mention RISC as a counter-point. ARM chips at least some of them also do speculative so they are not universally safer though some of the flaws found may need more work or not apply they still have the core security blunder. I wonder how long it will be until system designers realise speculative execution is just not a good idea for anything security related it opens so many cans of worms and now people have noticed they keep finding more.. At best speculative should be a well isolated co-processor arrangement to boost performance in the tasks its given. speculative execution is one of the worst ideas ever. Nothing like good old cycle counting for precise timing. ExifTool: Isn’t there a security mecanism called “tainting” or sth in Perl? Does it not work or did they not use it? As far as i understand the use eval to parse user supplied stuff it seems basic knowledge that this is dangerous?? Its stuff like Spectre that make me seriously consider pulling my old SPARC box out of retirement… I am constantly surprised at the the security flaws in software like that SMTP is one of the oldest protocols still in use how are people still screwing it up? They’re not “still” screwing it up. They screwed it up yonks ago when Exim was first written and it’s never been spotted and fixed until now. I was more talking about how I keep seeing bug reports for other SMTP servers as well I still see sendmail and postfix bugs even OpenSMTPd still pushes code updates to plug security holes. I guess software must be difficult or something.  Specifically complex software without serious flaws. One of the worst flaws in SMTP is it allows putting SMTP in the server name. One of the worst things ever for tech support because about 50% of people are incapable of typing S M T P when told to during a support call. SNPT SNBV… you get the idea. ISP IT departments PLEASE do not name your SMTP server with SMTP! Been 20 years since I worked a helldesk and that still makes me cringe thanks to the shorthand for Symmetric Mail Transport Protocol being four of the worst letters in the English alphabet for being confusable with other letters. Automatic Electronic Letter Carrier. AELC would be a string of four letters I’d expect most people (especially senior citizens with bad hearing) would be less likely to confuse with others or transpose. Might be easier to name it SierraMikeTangoPapa as it would be easier to remember for the initiated. “The primary solution appears to be just dropping NFC packets that don’t appear valid rather than trying to handle them anyway.” security would be substantially better.  Seriously this should be the default behavior. But then you break the one edge-case oddball (ab)use of NFC tags by some proprietary app that some large corporation uses and they get mad and complain security would be substantially better. Seriously this should be the default behavior.” Please be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent. ( This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

Every day new information systems are developed and every day new users are connected and data can be accessed 24/7 from anywhere in the world. Faster and better software development methods are desperately needed W3Schools has developed a very flexible technique for retrieving without the need for traditional programming. W3schools has developed a vocabulary for defining Web applications.
The vocabulary is called AppML (Application Modeling Language). AppML uses the most up-to-date techniques and ideas of modern Web development with focus on: High Speed and Low Bandwidth Consumption Full Separation of Content from Presentation AppML supports the functions you find in other frameworks like
React but AppML is much easier to use and much easier to understand. AppML is not a programming language. It is descriptive language (a language for describing applications). It is built around familiar Web application concepts like: AppML runs in any HTML page. No installation is required. AppML is a tool for bringing data to HTML applications: HTML is not very suitable for describing web applications. AppML is made for web applications: to control the behavior of 
HTML data. AppML is very easy to understand and extraordinarily quick to develop. This example shows how easy AppML can bring data to HTML: AppML is a tool for easy and agile web application development. there are many frameworks (tools or libraries) designed to 
extend HTML. Most of these frameworks manipulate HTML CSS or JavaScript in a way that 
makes them difficult to use (especially when used in combination). AppML is different. You have 
full HTML AppML makes it easy to create Single Page Applications (SPA) in a very clean 
and efficient way. Even if you have never worked with web development before you will find AppML 
very easy to use. If you are an experienced web developer you will soon discover 
the power of AppML. If you want to report an error or if you want to make a suggestion do not hesitate to send us an e-mail: Your message has been sent to W3Schools. W3Schools is optimized for learning and training. Examples might be simplified to improve reading and learning.

He teaches men and women to unlock their amazing potential and change the world around them. It was just after 5 AM as I gathered my things to head to the gym. As I walked down the hall I noticed the light on in my daughter Kinsey’s bedroom. She isn’t typically up that early so I decided to peek inside to see what was going on. I saw her sitting in bed with her laptop open and a perplexed look on her face. “What are you doing?” I asked. and she works full-time and goes to school so I didn’t want to question her actions. Still it hit me. This was one way she kept her motivation to study when she was too busy with work. I didn’t want to disturb her further so I slowly closed the door and went on my way pondering the question on my own “how does one maintain their motivation to study when they are too busy with work?” Motivation is an interesting topic that psychologists and scientists of all types have studied for decades. Countless books and articles have been written on the subject and continue to pop up each year. But what motivates us in certain situations? How can we stay motivated when we have so many other things on our minds like work? we first need to understand motivation itself. More specifically the two types of motivation: is an incentive to engage in a specific activity that derives from pleasure in the activity itself rather than because of any external benefits that might be obtained. “I’m going to work hard to get that promotion so I can be more fulfilled at work.” is an external incentive to engage in a specific activity especially motivation arising from the expectation of punishment or reward. “I really want that promotion at work to make more money.” How we are motivated really comes down to whether the motivation is coming from within us or outside us. We all tend to gravitate toward one more than the other but this can depend on a specific situation. Let’s look at the facts from the specific situation in my example and break them down to understand them further. Kinsey works and goes to school like a lot of college students. Kinsey was taking her exam very early in the morning before her usual wake-up time. She was doing the exam before going to work. She had a busy day of work ahead. She acknowledged that she would not want to do it later. All of the facts above point to a . What they don’t tell us specifically is was she motivated intrinsically or extrinsically? I would lean towards intrinsic as there doesn’t seem to be any obvious reward. This example provides some less apparent clues to ways that can help others like you. I’ve compiled the secrets inspired by these clues along with some additional wisdom I’ve learned along the way to help you in maintaining your motivation to study. Here are 11 tips on how to motivate yourself to study even when you’re too busy with work. and a positive mindset can go a long way. Believe that you will achieve your goals and focus on the good things that you have already done. Studies show that being optimistic leads to getting more done and having better overall mental and physical well-being. Once your mindset is in order then the next step is to your success. Begin with a clear vision of what you want to achieve and then experience the feeling of having that success. For example if you know you want to get an A on an exam break down the steps to learning the material to ensure success. 3. Break Your Goals Into Small Attainable Tasks a goal can feel too big like graduating college with straight A’s. Think of the goals you have and break them down into simple if you know you want to get an A on an exam start with gathering the right resources to study and then go further to identify what you need from each resource. Once you drill down far enough help keep you motivated as long as they are healthy. Once you’ve set a goal establish a small reward for achieving it. Whether it’s an edible treat you love or something bigger like a massage this type of external motivator can help maintain your motivation and push you closer to your bigger goals. is a time management system that encourages you to work with the time you have rather than against it. Break the time you have to study into 25-minute chunks separated by 5-minute breaks. Each interval or Pomodoro helps you resist interruptions and trains your brain to focus. You’ll find that the sense of urgency it creates is a fantastic motivator. Once you start to accomplish goals and have successful Pomodoro’s you need to measure it all. If you do not measure and report your progress then you’re probably not making much progress at all. According to Pearson’s Law it improves; when performance is measured and reported Healthy competition is advantageous to keep you moving and it’s great for building your motivation to study. You can positively compete with others to push each other to succeed. If you don’t have anyone else then set up a competition with yourself. see how many Pomodoro’s you can do without breaking focus and looking at your phone. Keep pushing the bar higher and you will strive to reach it. Another way for you to build and maintain your motivation to study is to find a mentor. is a great way to motivate and connect with someone you admire or someone in the field that you are studying. Having a mentor provides a double benefit in that they can provide both assistance and encouragement to you on your road to success. While this is occasionally the role of a mentor you can also find another person studying the same thing as you as your accountability buddy or partner. With both of you focused on the same outcome you can share ideas that you may not have thought of and understand the point of view of your friend. Studies show that publicly committing your goals to someone gives you at least a 65% chance of completing them. Having a specific accountability partner increases your chance of success to 95%. There’s a funny line from an old movie Fast Times at Ridgemont High where a student is disrupting class and the teacher tells him to stop interrupting the class and do what he’s doing on his own time. The student responds doesn’t that make it our time?” Whether you are studying with a group or solo you still need to find the time that works best for your needs and your brain. For some this is first thing in the morning it’s after work when they have decompressed. By measuring your success and the efficiency of your Pomodoro’s you can identify the optimal time for you. Taking the time to move is critical toward moving towards your goals. It doesn’t matter if you study at a desk you still need to move. Take short five-minute breaks after each successful Pomodoro to stand up and move your legs around. This increased blood flow will help keep you awake and get oxygen to your brain. After you’ve completed four consecutive sessions then it’s time for a more extended 15 to 20-minute break. This break is the optimal time to get some fresh air and brief exercise outside. This short amount of time will make a significant difference in your level of motivation. Any of the above tips on their own can help with building and maintaining motivation when put into action. Find the ones that work for you and make them a habit. Once this is done you won’t need the level of external motivation as you will be programmed internally for success. I want to think that I’ve raised Kinsey with some good internal programming and her grades indicate that as well. When she got home from work around 7 PM she came into my office and asked if she could use it for a while. what do you need to do?” I closed the door and left her in the serenity of my cave knowing she would get a good grade on her exam. I ended up being right about the grade but not about the source of her motivation to study that morning. When she emerged from the office about 30 minutes later she quickly turned on the TV. It all came down to the fact that she didn’t want to miss the season finale of The Batchelor. I guess it was more extrinsic than I thought.

The day you realize how amazing you are is the day the world had better stand back. 6. You need to know on a good day how to look after yourself and your success on a bad day. How will you ensure you take action on this advice? 7. Your mind can be a power for your success or power for your failure. Choose wisely the quality of your thoughts. How will you monitor the quality of your thoughts and ensure they work for you? 8. Even the long-distance swimmer does not achieve success on their own—who is in your team toward success? 9. How do you keep going? Look how far you have come. What helped you get this far? Who helped you get this far? How will they feature in the future to ensure you succeed and overcome? 10. Life is easier with love—swap the word “life” for success achieving your goals. Now ask yourself—where do you get your love from? The first place should be you. 12. Learn the science of who you are. This is powerful knowledge that will empower you to move forward no matter what you face or want to achieve. 13. Trying to copy the route to success that someone else took doesn’t guarantee you success. You have to honor your values 14. What you think is possible is absolutely correct. Challenge what you think. ask this question every day and score yourself out of 10 (10 being exceptional 1 being lousy). Write the answer in your phone’s calendar: How successful do I feel? You can swap successful for happy etc. Notice what affects your score. 16. Remember that everything changes. The hibernating tree looks dead but will return in the spring rejuvenated. This is essential knowledge for good times and bad. In bad times it reminds you to keep going it reminds you to be grateful and keep looking to learn and grow. (Just like that tree!) 17.

Nothing can have power over you unless you let it. 18. Steer clear of negative people and views. It’s all too easy to get dragged into other people’s negativity. Understand how negative news and people impact you. If you can’t find ways to keep that negativity away then step away metaphorically and physically. Your success will appreciate it. 19. The quality of your thoughts and feelings impacts your actions and results. Everything you can see started as a thought. So “are my thoughts enabling me or disabling me?” Are my thoughts “moving me forward or holding me back?” 21. Sad isn’t bad. We get all the emotions not just the good ones. So don’t push those emotions away. Take yourself through this process: For what reason am I feeling this? What does it tell me about my life right now? What does it tell me about my actions and results right now? What would I like to feel instead? What would this do for me? How will I get myself there? Take yourself through the process and own all emotions. 23. The one thing you can control is what you think. your job is not to fit in. Your job is to shine. Stand out. Speak up and be the unique individual you are meant to be. It’s the quickest way to lasting success. 25. Words can only have power if you let them. Good words bad words. Happy words. Successful words. Which words are you giving the most power to? 26. If you want to achieve more you’ve got to assume you are worth it. Are you worth it? (The answer is “Yes with bells on are you worth it!”) And if you don’t believe this then what will you do to rocket your confidence? it is a gift in disguise.

It’s like wanting to go on holiday and just rocking up at the airport on the off chance you can get on a plane going to your dream destination. Plan what you want and create a to help get you there. It’s easier and faster. 29. Everyone needs someone in their corner—someone to cheerlead and wipe your grazed knees and remind you that you can. Who is in your corner? You can add me to that list. 30.

When someone tells you that one book changed their life that doesn’t mean it will work for you. If it doesn’t work for you the book failed. The book was the wrong book for you. Don’t stop reading. Just look for the right fit for you. 33. Just as all people are different with different beliefs and aspirations so is the journey to success and progress different for all. Expecting to move forward and get what you want by copying others is not the same as looking up to the right role models. and progress in life are not dependent on luck. It is dependent on self-belief. Check your levels. 35. It is not beneficial to apologize for what you need in life. It takes away its value to you. If you need it 35. It’s a good idea to know the difference between enjoying the breeze and being pushed around by life. 36. Motivation. If you are needing some don’t look for it on a bad day. Look for it on a good day. Music and dancing can be the key to kick you back into action and results. 37. Black and white. Nothing in life is black and white and yet people want things to be like this—to be “yes” or “no.” Final. Getting what you want in life rarely is so finite. You need to be able to accept a bit of grey area in life to get more of what you want. Being someone reliant on absolutes makes it so much harder. 38. The racing driver does not concentrate on the brick wall at the side of the road as they race at 100+ miles per hour. They concentrate on the bend and success. If you don’t want to hit the wall 40. Choosing to stop thinking about something because it upsets you or angers you doesn’t mean your brain is not trying to process how you feel.

One holds power over you and one takes ownership. Which one are you using? Can you tell the difference? 46. Whoever said words had no power had never met a powerful coach! Words can be the building blocks to overcoming anything and getting what you want in life. So what words are you allowing in your head? How do you word your goals and ambitions? 47. Feel the fear and do it anyway. Is that a good idea with a starving tiger in the same room? Will you stick around and have a chat about how you wish to overcome the fear of the tiger or will you take action? Move so far away from your fear that it doesn’t exist? And get an expert to help you deal with the tiger? Analogies like this help you see how fear is allowed to stick around and how to get rid of it permanently. 48. Believing that “it is what it is” is a great way to stay stuck. If you choose to believe there is a better way 49. Being honest about what you face is not moaning it’s reaching out.

1620761731.355834,80000685,https://hackaday.com/blog,Cross-section of a 35mm top hat DIN rail. One of the great things about the Internet is it lets people find out what other people are doing even if they normally wouldn’t have much exposure to each other. For example in some businesses DIN rails are a part of everyday life. But for a long time they were not very common in hobby electronics. Although rails are cheap boxes for rails aren’t always easy or cheap to obtain but 3D printing offers a solution for that. So while the industrial world has been using these handy rails for decades we are starting to see hobby projects incorporate them more often and people like [Makers Mashup] are discovering them and finding ways to and demonstrating them in this video If you haven’t encountered them yet DIN rails are a strip of metal bent into a particular shape with the purpose of mounting equipment like circuit breakers. A typical rail is 35 mm wide and has a hat-like cross-section which leads to the name “top hat” rail. A 25 mm channel lets you hide wiring and the surface has holes to allow you to mount the rail to a wall or a cabinet. These are sometimes called type O or type Ω rails or sections. too. A C-rail is shaped like a letter C and you can guess what a G section looks like too. Rails do come in different heights but the 35 mm is overwhelmingly common. However there are 15 mm rails and 75 mm rails You might think that particle physicists would be sad when an experiment comes up with different results than their theory would predict but nothing brightens up a field like unexplained phenomena.  Indeed particle physicists have been feverishly looking for deviations from the Standard Model. This year there have been tantalizing signs that a long unresolved discrepancy between theory and experiment will be confirmed by new experimental results. the quest to measure the magnetic moment of muons started more than 60 years ago and this has been measured ever more precisely since. From an experiment in 1959 at CERN in Switzerland to the turn of the century at Brookhaven to this year’s result at Fermilab the magnetic moment of the muon seems to be at odds with theoretical predictions. Although a statistical fluke is basically excluded this value also relies on complex theoretical calculations that are not all in agreement. Instead of heralding a new era of physics it might just be another headline too good to be true. But some physicists are mumbling “new particle” in hushed tones. Let’s see what all the fuss is about. Desiccant is common in 3D printing because the drier plastic filament is the better it prints. Beads of silica gel are great for controlling humidity but finding a porous container for them that is a convenient size is a little harder. 3D printing is a generally useful solution for custom containers but suffers from a slight drawback in this case: printing dense grills or hole patterns is not very efficient for filament-based printers. Dense hole patterns means lots of stopping and starting for the extruder which means a lot of filament retractions and longer print times in general. The green model is used as a modifier to the orange container (of which only the corners are left visible here) [The_Redcoat]’s solution to this is to avoid hole patterns or grills altogether print large wall sections of the container as infill-only with no perimeter layers at all . The exposed infill pattern is dense enough to prevent small beads of desiccant from falling through while allowing ample airflow at the same time. The big advantage here is that infill patterns are also quite efficient for the printer to lay down. Instead of the loads of stops and starts and retractions needed to print a network of holes infill patterns are mostly extruded in layers of unbroken lines. This translates to faster print speeds and an overall more reliable outcome even on printers that might not be as well tuned or calibrated as they could be. to create a stack of segments to use as a modifier in PrusaSlicer. The container is printed as normal except where it intersects with the modifier in which case those areas get printed with infill only and no walls. The result is what you see here: enough airflow for the desiccant to do its job while not allowing any of the beads to escape. It’s a clever use of both a high infill as well as the ability to use a 3D model as a slicing modifier. There’s also another approach to avoiding having to print a dense pattern of holes though it is for light-duty applications only: embedding a material like tulle into a 3D print can make a pretty great fan filter The Russian Woodpecker: Official Bird Of The Cold War Nests In Giant Antenna as Americans celebrated the country’s bicentennial with beer and bottle rockets a strong signal began disrupting shortwave and telecommunications signals all over the world. The signal was a rapid 10 Hz tapping that sounded like a woodpecker or a helicopter thup-thupping on the roof. It had a wide bandwidth of 40 kHz and sometimes exceeded 10 MW. human for scale. Image by Corsairoz This was during the Cold War and plenty of people rushed to the conclusion that it was some sort of Soviet mind control scheme or weather control experiment. But amateur radio operators traced the mysterious signal to an over-the-horizon radar antenna near Chernobyl Ukraine (then part of the USSR) and they named it the Russian Woodpecker. Here’s a clip of the sound The frequency-hopping Woodpecker signal was so strong that it made communication impossible on certain channels and could even be heard across telephone lines when conditions were right. Several countries filed official complaints with the USSR through the UN but there was no stopping the Russian Woodpecker. Russia wouldn’t even own up to the signal’s existence which has since been traced to that is nearly half a mile long and at 490 feet stands slightly taller than the Great Pyramid at Giza. This imposing steel structure stands within the irradiated forest near Pripyat an idyllic town founded in 1970 to house the Chernobyl nuclear plant workers. Pictured above is the transmitter or Duga-3 depending on who you ask. Located 30 miles northeast of Chernobyl on old Soviet maps the area is simply labeled Boy Scout Camp. Today It was such a secret that the government denied it’s existence yet was being heard all over the world. What was this mammoth installation used for? “The Russian Woodpecker: Official Bird Of The Cold War Nests In Giant Antenna” Original Game Boy Powered Up With GBA Motherboard The Game Boy DMG-01 is about as iconic as a piece of consumer electronics can get it hasn’t exactly aged well. While there’s certainly a number of games for the system that are still as entertaining in 2021 as they were in the 80s and 90s the hardware itself is another story entirely. Having to squint at the unlit display with its somewhat nauseating green tint certainly takes away from the experience of hunting down Pokémon. Which is precisely why [The Poor Student Hobbyist] decided to take an original Game Boy and replace its internals with more modern hardware in the form of a Game Boy Advance (GBA) SP motherboard and aftermarket IPS LCD panel. The backwards compatibility mode of the GBA allows him to play those classic Game Boy and Game Boy Color games from their original cartridges while the IPS display brings them to life in a way never before possible. Relocating the cartridge connector took several attempts. this might seem like a relatively simple project. After all the GBA SP was much smaller than its predecessors so there should be plenty of room inside the relatively cavernous DMG-01 case for the transplanted hardware. But [The Poor Student Hobbyist] made things quite a bit harder on himself by deciding early on that there would be no external signs that the Game Boy had been modified; beyond the wildly improved screen That meant deleting the GBA’s shoulder buttons though since the goal was always to play older games that predated their addition to the system that wasn’t really a problem. The GBA’s larger and wider screen is still intact albeit hidden behind the Game Boy’s original bezel. It turns out the image isn’t exactly centered on the physical display so [The Poor Student Hobbyist] came up with a 3D printed adapter to mount it with a slight offset. The adapter also allows the small tactile switch that controls the screen brightness to be mounted where the “Contrast” wheel used to go. An incredible amount of thought and effort went into making the final result look as close to stock as possible [The Poor Student Hobbyist] did a phenomenal job of documenting it for others who might want to make similar modifications. Even if you’re not in the market for a rejuvenated Game Boy it’s worth browsing through the build log to marvel at the passion that went into this project. Some would argue [The Poor Student Hobbyist] should have just put a Raspberry Pi into a Game Boy case but where’s the fun in that? Sure it might have been a somewhat better Bitcoin miner but there’s something to be said for playing classic games on real hardware. [Robo] took it upon himself to in discrete transistor form. For bonus points he also managed to put it in a package that’s the same basic size and a plug-in replacement for the original. The first task was deciding which 555 circuit to implement. He examined a handful of different implementations — and by examined dissected them and studied the die circuitry under a microscope. In the end he went with Hans Camenzind’s original circuit both as a tribute and because it used the fewest transistors — a point which helped manage the final size which is only a little bit bigger than the IC! have you ever soldered an EIA 01005 resistor? We agree with [mbedded.ninja] who wrote on a post about standard chip resistor sizes the 01005 is a “ridiculously small chip package that can barely be seen by the naked eye.”  It is 16 thou x 8 thou (0.4 mm x 0.2 mm) in size and despite its name and placement in the Imperial series it is not half the size of an 0201. The transistors are your standard 2N3904 / 2N3906 but purchased in a not-so-standard DFN (Dual Flat Pack No Leads). We might think a 1.0 x 0.6 mm component as small but compared to its neighboring resistors in this circuit [Robo] has done this kind of project before discrete recreation of of the classic 741 op-amp back in 2011. If you want to go really big-scale with your own reproduction project from five years ago for further inspiration. Thanks to [Lucas] for the tip. If you are of a certain age your first exposure to computer programming was probably BASIC. For a few years there were few cheaper ways to program in BASIC than the Sinclair ZX series of computers. If you long for those days you might find the 1980-something variant of BASIC a little limiting. Or you could use SpecBasic is apparently reasonably compatible with the Spectrum but lets you use your better hardware. For example instead of a 256×192 8-color screen SpecBas accommodates larger screens and up to 256 colors. However that does lead to certain incompatibilities that you can read about in the project’s README file.

There are two key ways I found when it came to improving my students’ level of focus: Make what we’re doing more interesting. Nothing is off the table here—from having ninja clowns on the rampage in a lesson to including popular games with a martial arts theme tapping into the student’s love of fun to help them focus. But when the needle starts to drop you may observe that your kids are feeling anxious or looking restless. New information and knowledge are not getting processed from the staging area or working memory into the long-term memory. It’s here that brain breaks make the most difference as they allow us to “top-up the tank” or reset the gauge so that we can continue to learn and focus and at a higher level. you’ll appreciate that brain breaks can help kids in many ways. They can reduce stress and frustration. Think of those times when you’re helping your kids solve a difficult problem. It’s taxing for you both and when compounded with the energy loss after a day at school or watching TV. The stress effect can be compounded and it’s here that brain breaks can be a lifesaver. The following is a selection of brain break ideas for kids. You’ll see that some are physical activities while others are more relaxing. It’s always great to test them out to see which ones connect the best with your children. It’s okay to repeat the same brain breaks. Having a clear name and mission to a break can help keep your child excited knowing that they’ll have the opportunity to take part in a future round of the activity. How Often Should You Introduce Brain Breaks? Examples: “Everyone with trainers on.” “Everyone who is left-handed.” “Everyone who is wearing yellow.” so have a look through a booklet or website for some safe ideas. Other examples are grabbing your nose with your left hand and touching your knee with your right elbow. is a popular way to reduce anxiety. There are lots of great examples already pre-recorded on YouTube that you can follow along with. Below is a useful classroom meditation example. is an epic way to help your child slow down. It is a quick way to relieve anxiety so that they feel more ready for the next task ahead. Try this: put your hands on your tummy breathe in through the nose and feel your belly expand like a balloon. Hold it here then slowly breathe out through the mouth while feeling your stomach get smaller. Repeat this 10 times. Use the following counts: breath in for 4 seconds and breath out for 4 seconds. My personal favorite is using a on our phones and finding a mushroom or toadstool then using the app to identify its name. This is surprisingly engaging for children. But a few safety rules about not touching them is important. It gives kids a change of scenery and helps revitalize the senses providing a welcome break from their homework. How Often Should You Introduce Brain Breaks? I’ve observed from my martial arts coaching that younger students have a smaller amount of working memory than older kids. My formula is for five minutes of technical training we provide five minutes of brain breaks for students under seven years old. Plus we coach to 15 minutes of training to five minutes of brain breaks for children under 12 years. Our martial arts center revolutionized our approach to coaching by using brain breaks for kids. We found that although we were teaching less technical skills there was now consistent progress from the students. Plus and are having more fun. This is a win overall. If you’ve been having challenges with your kids focusing at home maybe try a mixture of the calming and active breaks to see which types work best for your kids.

She loves to help people reach their goals in relationships Parents jokingly say that the most challenging part about raising kids is deciding what’s for dinner. While it’s funny there’s also a lot of truth to it. Kids can be picky. They love something one day and despise it the next. They also don’t care if something is healthy or not. And good luck ever getting dinner “right” if you have more than one kid. More kids equal more opinions. What can busy parents do to get their kids to eat healthy meals? How can mealtime be easier? you might be wondering if new recipes will even help. Picky eaters are good at refusing anything and everything. Kid-friendly meals won’t be beneficial if your child isn’t open to new things. Even kids that aren’t overly picky tend to shy away from new foods. Ironically they also hate eating the same things over and over. what’s the best way to overcome meal-time frustration? Make it fun! Distract kids with a bit of creativity. They’ll be more likely to eat if everyone is relaxed and enjoying the meal. Before I dive into the 35 dinner ideas for kids here are some tips for getting young kids to eat and break out of that dinner rut.(Mayo Clinic: Children’s Nutrition: 10 Tips For Picky Eaters – Switch things up by serving breakfast for dinner. Kids will love the surprise. Use fruit and sausage to make it more filling. Some days can be exceedingly rough so oatmeal and fruit can even be an option. – Kids love to help and will be more excited to try the food they helped make. Touching and seeing the ingredients during the process can help your child become more familiar with them and ease their uncertainty. The biggest benefit is you’ll be spending time together not to mention the value of learning to cook. – Set food and toppings out on the table buffet-style and allow kids to dish up their plates. What works well for a buffet? finger foods and chili are just a few of the many ideas out there. Don’t be afraid to come up with your own. – Turning a meal into art is another way to get kids interested. Nothing makes food more interesting than when it looks like a face or boat. Get creative with how you present the food! – The options here are endless. You could base it on your child’s favorite characters or focus on a different culture or even history. This is a great way to introduce your child to how and what others around the world eat. parents have to resort to shameless bribery to get kids to eat. It’s okay to use a little extra motivation to get kids to try something new. We all need a boost now and then. Avoid using dessert as a motive to eat dinner but what are some harmless bribes to try? For instance extra screen time or bedtime book. let’s get to the dinner ideas. Meal planning is just one more thing to do in an already busy day. This list of dinner recipes for kids can help.

Is food (or lack of) interfering with my child’s quality of life? It might be time to see a doctor if you see signs of health problems due to pickiness or lack of eating.

Instructions that a Python interpreter can execute are called statements. For example etc. are other kinds of statements which will be discussed later. the end of a statement is marked by a newline character. But we can make a statement extend over multiple lines with the line continuation character (\). For example: a = 1 + 2 + 3 + \
    4 + 5 + 6 + \
    7 + 8 + 9 This is an explicit line continuation. In Python line continuation is implied inside parentheses we can implement the above multi-line statement as: a = (1 + 2 + 3 +
    4 + 5 + 6 +
    7 + 8 + 9) do the line continuation implicitly. Same is the case with 'blue' 'green'] We can also put multiple statements in a single line using semicolons a = 1; b = 2; c = 3 Most of the programming languages like C to define a block of code. Python A code block (body of a etc.) starts with indentation and ends with the first unindented line. The amount of indentation is up to you but it must be consistent throughout that block. four whitespaces are used for indentation and are preferred over tabs. Here is an example. 11):
    print(i)
    if i == 5:
        break The enforcement of indentation in Python makes the code look neat and clean. This results in Python programs that look similar and consistent. Indentation can be ignored in line continuation but it's always a good idea to indent. It makes the code more readable. For example: if True:
    print('Hello')
    a = 5 if True: print('Hello'); a = 5 both are valid and do the same thing but the former style is clearer. Comments are very important while writing a program. They describe what is going on inside a program so that a person looking at the source code does not have a hard time figuring it out. You might forget the key details of the program you just wrote in a month's time. So taking the time to explain these concepts in the form of comments is always fruitful. we use the hash ( ) symbol to start writing a comment. It extends up to the newline character. Comments are for programmers to better understand a program. Python Interpreter ignores comments. #This is a comment
#print out Hello
print('Hello') We can have comments that extend up to multiple lines. One way is to use the hash( ) symbol at the beginning of each line. For example: #This is a long comment
#and it extends
#to multiple lines Another way of doing this is to use triple quotes These triple quotes are generally used for multi-line strings. But they can be used as a multi-line comment as well. Unless they are not docstrings they do not generate any extra code. """"""This is also a
perfect example of
multi-line comments"""""" A docstring is short for documentation string. Python docstrings (documentation strings) are the literals that appear right after the definition of a function Triple quotes are used while writing docstrings. For example: def double(num):
    """"""Function to double the value""""""
    return 2*num Docstrings appear right after the definition of a function or a module. This separates docstrings from multiline comments using triple quotes. The docstrings are associated with the object as their we can access the docstrings of the above function with the following lines of code: def double(num):
    """"""Function to double the value""""""
    return 2*num
print(double.__doc__) To learn more about docstrings in Python Join our newsletter for the latest updates. Join our newsletter for the latest updates. Java

One of the great things about the Internet is it lets people find out what other people are doing even if they normally wouldn’t have much exposure to each other. For example in some businesses DIN rails are a part of everyday life. But for a long time they were not very common in hobby electronics. Although rails are cheap boxes for rails aren’t always easy or cheap to obtain but 3D printing offers a solution for that. So while the industrial world has been using these handy rails for decades we are starting to see hobby projects incorporate them more often and people like [Makers Mashup] are discovering them and finding ways to and demonstrating them in this video If you haven’t encountered them yet DIN rails are a strip of metal bent into a particular shape with the purpose of mounting equipment like circuit breakers. A typical rail is 35 mm wide and has a hat-like cross-section which leads to the name “top hat” rail. A 25 mm channel lets you hide wiring and the surface has holes to allow you to mount the rail to a wall or a cabinet. These are sometimes called type O or type Ω rails or sections. too. A C-rail is shaped like a letter C and you can guess what a G section looks like too. Rails do come in different heights but the 35 mm is overwhelmingly common. However there are 15 mm rails and 75 mm rails A device attached to a DIN rail. Devices clamp against the “brim” of the top hat while the top of the hat is affixed to the wall or bulkhead. You’ll sometimes hear the width of a rail expressed in “modules.” A module is 17.5 mm wide so a three-module device is 52.5 mm wide. The DIN rail originated in Germany around 1928 with modern versions dating from the 1950s and in some environments they are everywhere. DIN is an acronym for the originating German standards organization Deutsches Institut für Normung but the rails also meet IEC and EN standards If you want to know more about DIN rails and you can make a variety of very sturdy structures. Actually the channel isn’t very convenient for hiding wires because there is no leeway left for unmouting equipment. Professional modules (in Europe we use DIN rails in electrical switchboards (is that how you call the boxes with fuses switches and RCDs?)) have terminals on the top and bottom. BTW and you will find plenty and cheap. > A 25 mm channel lets you hide wiring Uh no… you don’t want to put wiring inside that channel. Some Modules have some stuff extending into that space (I think) and the flexibility of a rail diminishes when you force yourself to leave room in the middle between neighboring modules because some wires exit the channel there. What might be nice are bus bars with a control bus on it (i²c ?) inside the rail. Modules could automatically connect to that control bus when attached to that DIN rail.

Monday through Friday I wake up at 5:00 AM without hitting the snooze button even once. I never take naps and rarely feel tired throughout the day. The following is my advice on how to start your day (everyday) at 5:00 AM.The idea of waking up early and starting the day at or before the sunrise is the desire of many people. Many highly successful people attribute their success to rising early. Early-risers have more productive mornings and report less stress on average than “late-risers.” However the task of waking up at 5:00 AM can seem extremely daunting. This article will present five tips about how to physically wake up at 5:00 AM and how to get yourself mentally ready to have a productive day. Many people simply “can’t” get up early because they are stuck in a routine. Whether this is getting to bed unnecessarily late or waiting until the absolute last possible moment before getting out of bed “sleeping in” can easily consume your entire morning. The following tips will let you break the “sleeping in” routine. Having an alarm clock too close to your bed is the number one reason people simply cannot get up in the morning. If your alarm clock is within arms reach of your bed or if you can turn your alarm clock off without getting out of bed you are creating an unnecessarily difficult situation for yourself. Before I became an early-riser there were many times that I would turn off my alarm without even waking up enough to remember turning it off. I recommend moving your alarm clock far enough away from your bed that you have to get completely out of bed to turn it off. I keep my alarm clock in the bathroom. This may not be possible for all living arrangements I use my cellphone as an alarm clock and putting it in the bathroom makes perfect sense. In order to turn off my alarm I have to get completely out of bed and since going to the restroom and taking a shower are the first two things I do everyday keeping the alarm clock in the bathroom streamlines the start of my morning. The snooze feature on all modern alarm clocks serves absolutely no constructive purpose. Don’t even try the “it helps me slowly wake up” lie. I recommend buying an alarm that does not have a snooze button. If you can’t find an alarm without a snooze button never read the instructions so you will never know how long your snooze button lasts. Not knowing whether it waits 10 minutes or 60 minutes should be enough of a deterrent to get you to stop using it. If you use the same buzzer day in and day out you begin to develop a tolerance to the sound. The alarm clock will slowly become less effective at waking you up over time. Most newer alarm clocks will let you set a different buzzer tone for the different days of the week. If you change your buzzer frequently you will have an easier time waking up. If you absolutely cannot wake up without repetitive snoozing try making a puzzle for yourself. It doesn’t take rocket science to understand that the longer your alarm is going off the more awake you will become. Try making your alarm very difficult to turn off by putting it under the sink putting it under the bed by forcing yourself to complete a puzzle to turn it off. Try putting your alarm into a combination-locked box and make yourself put in the combination in order to turn off the alarm — it’s annoying Getting up at 5:00 AM is much easier if you are doing it Monday through Friday rather than sporadically during the week. I recommend setting an alarm once that repeats everyday. Also going to bed at about the same time every night is an important factor to having a productive morning. Learn how much sleep you need to get in order to not feel exhausted the following day. Some people can get by on 4-6 hours while most need 7-8. Make sure you have a specific reason to get up in the morning. Getting up at 5:00 AM just for the heck of it is a lot more difficult than if you are getting up early to plan your day get an early start on work etc. I recommend finding something you want to do for yourself in the morning. It will be a lot easier to get up if you are guaranteed to do something fun for yourself — compare this to going on vacation. You probably have no problem waking up very early on vacation or during holidays. My goal every morning is to bring that excitement to the day by doing something fun for myself. I have been using these tips for a very long time. Joining the world of early-risers has been a great decision. I feel less stressed and I feel happier than I did when I was a late-riser. If you follow these tips you can become an early-riser too. Do you have any tips that I didn’t mention? What works best for you? Let us know in the comments.

We can argue that talent is the biggest factor; we may debate how the amount of charisma sets the two apart. Yet if you were to show me what you believed to be a great leader I can show you the habits that made her/him great. Great leaders have great habits and know how to work hard the smart way. Developing Great Habits Is Hard Work How to Work Hard by Working Smarter Developing Great Habits Is Hard Work I was in his office getting ready for my weekly trumpet lesson. As I was preparing my eyes scanned the room and saw that there were quotes all over his office. My eyes rested on one quote that forever changed my thinking about my playing. It was a quote from my high school basketball coach Tim Notke that would become popular through professional athletes Kevin Durant and Tim Tebow: “Hard work beats talent when talent fails to work hard.” hard work is the key to your success. A good work ethic creates the momentum that propels you forward towards your goals. the world would have transformed hundreds of times over. Yet when we look out our doors or turn on the news we do not see a utopian society. We have thousands of people who become inspired but lack the work ethic to apply anything they have learned. Time and time again frustration creeps in. We are so motivated and inspired by what we see but fail to put in place the things that would change our lives. Frustration happens when the gap between what you expect to be true and what is true gets bigger. Motivation tends to create an expectation that is not rooted in reality. We want to take on the world but cannot get off Netflix long enough to do so. but working hard is. Good habits and routines that produce success are the byproducts of a strong work ethic. The habits and routines we create and follow are the foundation on which we build a winning life. How to Work Hard by Working Smarter 1. Define What a Win Looks Like Why is it that we can define what a win looks like but we fail to do so in our leadership Learning how to work hard without setting a target is futile. It is insanity to work hard without having a clear direction to place your energy. I would argue that defining a win is one of the most important routines that a leader can have. Defining a win separates superficial activity from meaningful activity. I know the goal line I have to cross . Knowing where the goal line is informs me of the activity I have to engage in to cross it. Without a clear direction I am spinning my wheels hoping that I will get to a destination I haven’t defined. It is like asking a GPS for directions but failing to input the destination. 4 Steps to Define a Win Set your activity list to only do that which will complete your goals. I am not looking for any emotional reactions from the audience. I win if I clearly communicated my point so that anyone hearing the talk can take it and apply it to their lives that day. That is how I define a win when I speak now. Create a habit of declaring a win. When you do you will see your productivity soar and your encouragement increase. Pairing a hard work ethic with wise decisions creates victory. Stop being a mouse on a wheel that goes nowhere and start being the captain of your fleet. Not only do we need to learn how to evaluate our activity but we must make this a core routine in our arsenal of success. Stop working so hard on everything and start learning how to work hard on the right things. Not every activity will move the needle forward for you. In fact you were never meant to do everything yourself! Once we stop trying to be a martyr in our leadership we can start looking at how to take things off our plates through there are 4 things that we look at when deciding on which activities are important: Does this activity move me towards or away from my goals? Do I have to do this activity or can I give this activity away to someone else? Does this activity have to be now right now or can it be scheduled for later dates? Does this activity have to be done at all? what does not make it on your calendar does not get done. It is a simple truth that is often overlooked. Your calendar contains the power to change your life. Yet we don’t use our calendars to their fullest potential. “You will never change your life until you change something you do daily. The secret of your success is found in your daily routine.” -John C. Maxwell “The key is not to prioritize what’s on your schedule but to schedule your priorities.” -Stephen Covey It’s time to take your leadership and business to the next level. It’s time to start putting your daily routines on your calendar 4. Reflect on Your Day and Plan the Next Hard work starts when your feet hit the ground in the morning. Creating the habit of winning starts with the first thing you accomplish that morning. If you win your morning you will win your day. But how often have you heard people talk about an evening routine? Tomorrow is won the day before it happens. When you fail to you may put your effort toward in the wrong things. Route replaces routine. Indecision replaces decisiveness. Losses replace wins. The discouragement will deflate your momentum and increases the chances of procrastination. That is why we set our schedule the night before. “Every battle is won or lost before it is ever fought.” -Sun Tzu Use these questions to reflect on your day: What do I need to start doing? What do I need to stop doing? “Champions aren’t made in the ring; they are merely recognized there.” That work is setting your routines in order because you now know that success flows from your daily routines. If you are not experiencing the success you desire then it is time to change things up.

Assigning values to Variables in Python Assigning value to constant in Python Naming Convention for Variables and constants you will learn about Python variables literals and their use cases. A variable is a named location used to store data in the memory. It is helpful to think of variables as a container that holds data that can be changed later in the program. For example we have created a variable named . We have assigned the value You can think of variables as a bag to store books in it and that book can be replaced at any time. we don't actually assign values to the variables. Instead Python gives the reference of the object(value) to the variable. Assigning values to Variables in Python As you can see from the above example you can use the assignment operator to assign a value to a variable. Example 1: Declaring and assigning value to a variable we printed out the value assigned to so you don't have to explicitly define the variable type. It automatically knows that is a string and declares the Example 2: Changing the value of a variable website = ""apple.com""
print(website)

# assigning a new value to website
website = ""programiz.com""

print(website) the value is changed to Example 3: Assigning multiple values to multiple variables If we want to assign the same value to multiple variables at once we can do this as: x = y = z = ""same""

print (x)
print (y)
print (z) string to all the three variables A constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed. It is helpful to think of constants as containers that hold information which cannot be changed later. You can think of constants as a bag to store some books which cannot be replaced once placed inside the bag. Assigning value to constant in Python constants are usually declared and assigned in a module. Here the module is a new file containing variables etc which is imported to the main file. Inside the module constants are written in all capital letters and underscores separating the words. Example 3: Declaring and assigning value to a constant we assign the constant value to we print the constant value. we don't use constants in Python. Naming them in all capital letters is a convention to separate them from variables it does not actually prevent reassignment. Rules and Naming Convention for Variables and constants Constant and variable names should have a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase ( Create a name that makes sense. For example If you want to create a variable name having two words use underscore to separate them. For example: Use capital letters possible to declare a constant. For example: Never use special symbols like ! Don't start a variable name with a digit. Literal is a raw data given in a variable or constant. In Python there are various types of literals they are as follows: Numeric Literals are immutable (unchangeable). Numeric literals can belong to 3 different numerical types: Example 4: How to use Numeric literals in Python? a = 0b1010 #Binary Literals
b = 100 #Decimal Literal 
c = 0o310 #Octal Literal
d = 0x12c #Hexadecimal Literal

#Float Literal
float_1 = 10.5 
float_2 = 1.5e2

#Complex Literal 
x = 3.14j

print(a 10 100 200 300
10.5 150.0
3.14j 3.14 0.0 We assigned integer literals into different variables. Here all the literals are converted into decimal values. is expressed with exponential and is equivalent to We assigned a complex literal i.e literal (x.real) to create imaginary and real parts of complex numbers. To learn more about Numeric Literals A string literal is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes. We can use both single or triple quotes for a string. And a character literal is a single character surrounded by single or double quotes. Example 7: How to use string literals in Python? strings = ""This is Python""
char = ""C""
multiline_str = """"""This is a multiline string with more than one line code.""""""
unicode = u""\u00dcnic\u00f6de""
raw_str = r""raw \n string""

print(strings)
print(char)
print(multiline_str)
print(unicode)
print(raw_str) This is Python
C
This is a multiline string with more than one line code.
Ünicöde
raw \n string is a Unicode literal which supports characters other than English. In this case A Boolean literal can have any of the two values: Example 8: How to use boolean literals in Python? x = (1 == True)
y = (1 == False)
a = True + 4
b = False + 10

print(""x is"" x is True
y is False
a: 5
b: 10 in numeric expressions as the value. The value of Python contains one special literal i.e. . We use it to specify that the field has not been created. Example 9: How to use special literals in Python? drink = ""Available""
food = None

def menu(x):
    if x == drink:
        print(drink)
    else:
        print(food)

menu(drink)

One of the great things about the Internet is it lets people find out what other people are doing even if they normally wouldn’t have much exposure to each other. For example in some businesses DIN rails are a part of everyday life. But for a long time they were not very common in hobby electronics. Although rails are cheap boxes for rails aren’t always easy or cheap to obtain but 3D printing offers a solution for that. So while the industrial world has been using these handy rails for decades we are starting to see hobby projects incorporate them more often and people like [Makers Mashup] are discovering them and finding ways to and demonstrating them in this video If you haven’t encountered them yet DIN rails are a strip of metal bent into a particular shape with the purpose of mounting equipment like circuit breakers. A typical rail is 35 mm wide and has a hat-like cross-section which leads to the name “top hat” rail. A 25 mm channel lets you hide wiring and the surface has holes to allow you to mount the rail to a wall or a cabinet. These are sometimes called type O or type Ω rails or sections. too. A C-rail is shaped like a letter C and you can guess what a G section looks like too. Rails do come in different heights but the 35 mm is overwhelmingly common. However there are 15 mm rails and 75 mm rails A device attached to a DIN rail. Devices clamp against the “brim” of the top hat while the top of the hat is affixed to the wall or bulkhead. You’ll sometimes hear the width of a rail expressed in “modules.” A module is 17.5 mm wide so a three-module device is 52.5 mm wide. The DIN rail originated in Germany around 1928 with modern versions dating from the 1950s and in some environments they are everywhere. DIN is an acronym for the originating German standards organization Deutsches Institut für Normung but the rails also meet IEC and EN standards If you want to know more about DIN rails and you can make a variety of very sturdy structures. Actually the channel isn’t very convenient for hiding wires because there is no leeway left for unmouting equipment. Professional modules (in Europe we use DIN rails in electrical switchboards (is that how you call the boxes with fuses switches and RCDs?)) have terminals on the top and bottom. BTW and you will find plenty and cheap. > A 25 mm channel lets you hide wiring Uh no… you don’t want to put wiring inside that channel. Some Modules have some stuff extending into that space (I think) and the flexibility of a rail diminishes when you force yourself to leave room in the middle between neighboring modules because some wires exit the channel there. What might be nice are bus bars with a control bus on it (i²c ?) inside the rail. Modules could automatically connect to that control bus when attached to that DIN rail.

Every value in Python has a datatype. Since everything is an object in Python programming data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes. There are various data types in Python. Some of the important types are listed below. floating point numbers and complex numbers fall under function to know which class a variable or a value belongs to. Similarly function is used to check if an object belongs to a particular class. 5 is of type <class 'int'>
2.0 is of type <class 'float'>
(1+2j) is complex number? True Integers can be of any length it is only limited by the memory available. A floating-point number is accurate up to 15 decimal places. Integer and floating points are separated by decimal points. Complex numbers are written in the form is the imaginary part. Here are some examples. >>> a = 1234567890123456789
>>> a
1234567890123456789
>>> b = 0.1234567890123456789
>>> b
0.12345678901234568
>>> c = 1+2j
>>> c
(1+2j) is an ordered sequence of items. It is one of the most used datatype in Python and is very flexible. All the items in a list do not need to be of the same type. Declaring a list is pretty straight forward. Items separated by commas are enclosed within brackets We can use the slicing operator to extract an item or a range of items from a list. The index starts from 0 in Python. 40]

print(""a[2] = "" a[2] =  15
a[0:3] =  [5 the value of elements of a list can be altered. is an ordered sequence of items same as a list. The only difference is that tuples are immutable. Tuples once created cannot be modified. Tuples are used to write-protect data and are usually faster than lists as they cannot change dynamically. where items are separated by commas. We can use the slicing operator to extract items but we cannot change its value. 1+3j)

One of the great things about the Internet is it lets people find out what other people are doing even if they normally wouldn’t have much exposure to each other. For example in some businesses DIN rails are a part of everyday life. But for a long time they were not very common in hobby electronics. Although rails are cheap boxes for rails aren’t always easy or cheap to obtain but 3D printing offers a solution for that. So while the industrial world has been using these handy rails for decades we are starting to see hobby projects incorporate them more often and people like [Makers Mashup] are discovering them and finding ways to and demonstrating them in this video If you haven’t encountered them yet DIN rails are a strip of metal bent into a particular shape with the purpose of mounting equipment like circuit breakers. A typical rail is 35 mm wide and has a hat-like cross-section which leads to the name “top hat” rail. A 25 mm channel lets you hide wiring and the surface has holes to allow you to mount the rail to a wall or a cabinet. These are sometimes called type O or type Ω rails or sections. too. A C-rail is shaped like a letter C and you can guess what a G section looks like too. Rails do come in different heights but the 35 mm is overwhelmingly common. However there are 15 mm rails and 75 mm rails If you are of a certain age your first exposure to computer programming was probably BASIC. For a few years there were few cheaper ways to program in BASIC than the Sinclair ZX series of computers. If you long for those days you might find the 1980-something variant of BASIC a little limiting. Or you could use SpecBasic is apparently reasonably compatible with the Spectrum but lets you use your better hardware. For example instead of a 256×192 8-color screen SpecBas accommodates larger screens and up to 256 colors. However that does lead to certain incompatibilities that you can read about in the project’s README file. The Laser Power Record Has Been Broken Lasers do all sorts of interesting things and — as with so many things — more is better. Korean scientists announced recently they’ve created the most powerful laser beam to be exact. It turns out that 10 but has been done many times already at several facilities including the CoReLS petawatt (PW) laser used by the researchers. Just as improving a radio transmitter often involves antenna work instead of actual power increases this laser setup uses an improved focus mechanism to get more energy in a 1.1 micron spot. As you might expect doing this requires some pretty sophisticated optics. “The Laser Power Record Has Been Broken” Leap Motion Controls Hands With No Glove It isn’t uncommon to see a robot hand-controlled with a glove to mimic a user’s motion. [All Parts Combined] has a different method. Using a Leap Motion controller ecord hand motions with no glove and then play them back to the robot hand at will. You can see the project in the video the Leap documentation isn’t the best. Since he worked it out “Leap Motion Controls Hands With No Glove” The Fine Structure Constant In A Blink Electronics is really an applied branch of physics so it isn’t surprising that if you are serious about your electronics you probably know a little physics too. If you’ve ever heard the term and weren’t entirely sure what it means [Parth G] wants to explain it to you in about a minute. His video explanation appears below. You may know that the constant but what does that mean? The answer relates to the orbit of electrons. You might remember from school that electrons orbit in shells around the nucleus.  That is an atom might have some electrons in the innermost shell and more electrons in an outer shell. “The Fine Structure Constant In A Blink” It would seem that for as long as there have been ships on the ocean there’s been smuggling. The International Maritime Organisation requires ships to have AIS the automatic identification system which is akin to a transponder on an airplane. However if you don’t want to be found you often turn off your AIS. So how do governments and insurance companies track so-called dark ships? . A recent post in Global Investigative Journal tells the story of how lower-cost satellites are helping track these dark ships. Optical tracking is the obvious method but satellites that can image ships can be expensive and have problems with things like clouds. Radar is another option but — again — an expensive option if you aren’t a big military agency with money to spend. A company called HawkEye 360 uses smallsats to monitor ship’s RF emissions which is much less expensive and resource-intensive than traditional methods. Although the data may still require correlation with other methods like optical sensing it is still cost-effective compared to simply scanning the ocean for ships. Ask Hackaday: If Aliens Came By A few years ago we talked about the chance that the — Oumuamua — might be a derelict solar sail. That notion has been picking up steam in the popular press lately and it made us think again about the chances that the supposed rock was really a solar sail discarded or maybe even a probe flying with a solar sail. At the same time Mars is as close as it ever gets so there is a gaggle of our probes searching the red planet some of them looking for signs of past life. All this makes us think: if we did find life or even artifacts of intelligent life would we realize it? Sure we can usually figure out what’s alive here on Earth. But to paraphrase Justice Potter Stewart “We know it when we see it.” Defining life turns out to be surprisingly tricky recognizing alien technology would be even harder. “Ask Hackaday: If Aliens Came By The Russian Woodpecker: Official Bird Of The Cold War Nests In Giant Antenna And What It Can Do For You How To Build A Turbo Car The Cheap SpaceX Drops The Ball On Catching Fairings South Australia Vs.

Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later. This simple optimization reduces time complexities from exponential to polynomial. For example if we write simple recursive solution for we get exponential time complexity and if we optimize it by storing solutions of subproblems time complexity reduces to linear.

How Fish Oil Supplements Can Help You Lose Weight How Fish Oil Boosts Your Mental Clarity And Brain Power Krill Oil vs Fish Oil: Which Should You Take? Omega 3 fats are essential in our diet and there are lots of different sources and also supplements. There are pros and cons of both food sources and also I will guide you through the advantages and disadvantages of Krill oil vs fish oil supplements. I’ll also cover who needs to take these supplements and if krill oil is better than fish oil Where Are Omega Fatty Acids Found? Why Are Omega Fatty Acids So Important? Krill Oil Vs Cod Liver Oil Are There Risks With Krill Oil? Tips on How to Get Enough Omega-3 in Your Diet Where Are Omega Fatty Acids Found? Why Are Omega Fatty Acids So Important? There are many different prostaglandins with wide-ranging roles such as the sensation of pain regulation of pregnancy and birth and relaxation of smooth muscle. Thromboxanes regulate blood clotting by causing constriction of blood vessels and the aggregation of platelets (so they stick together) which are early steps in blood clotting. Leukotrienes are involved in immune function by attracting immune cells such as neutrophils to sites of inflammation. They also constrict bronchioles in the lungs and make capillary walls permeable. This is thought to be because the metabolic products of omega-3 fatty acids are less inflammatory than those produced from omega 6 fatty acids. Western diets are associated with an imbalance of omega-3 -6 such that instead of levels of omega 3 being higher than 6 the reverse is more commonly seen. This is associated with an increased risk of chronic inflammation. A large systemic review that combined 86 trials involving over 162 000 people looked at the effect of higher omega-3 intake versus lower omega-3 intake for at least a year. This was provided mostly by omega-3 supplements while a few trials gave oily fish. Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to reduce blood pressure and can be incorporated into your diet by eating oily fish or seeds There are three types of omega-3: those found in oily fish called EPA and DHA and the plant-based ALA. Fish oil is extracted from the body of the fish and contains some vitamin A and vitamin D as well. Cod liver oil is extracted from the liver of the fish and contains higher levels of vitamin A and D. High doses of vitamin A can be toxic as it is a fat-soluble vitamin that is stored by your body. This is why omega 3 supplements that contain vitamin A are to be avoided in pregnancy because high levels of this vitamin may damage the fetus. it was thought that Krill oil was more bioavailable than fish oil but there were problems with this research with regards to dosing. a randomized controlled trial in 66 people was performed to answer this question and compared the bioavailability of krill oil compared with fish oil. It found that there was no difference between blood measurements of DHA and EPA. Therefore the evidence does not support krill oil being “better” or needing lower doses than fish oil. Krill Oil Vs Fish Oil in Terms of Cholesterol In group (meta) analysis of seven trials totaling 662 participants Krill oil supplementation was found to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides but not total cholesterol. Whether this translates to decreased risk of cardiovascular disease needs further research. krill oil was not superior to fish oil supplementation and had very similar effects on cholesterol. Krill Oil Vs Cod Liver Oil There is a risk that since the liver is used to filter out toxins there is the possibility that cod liver oil contains more environmental contaminants than fish oil or krill oil. Are There Risks With Krill Oil? Krill make up a vital part of the Antarctic food chain and a huge number of species higher up the food chain depend on them. Fishing krill has the potential to catastrophically destabilize this important food chain. Therefore fish oils are more sustainable than krill oil. They found that EPA and DHA decreased triglycerides (a type of fat) by about 15% and reduced the risk of coronary artery death and coronary events which are illnesses of arteries supplying the heart. However they did not affect cardiovascular events (e.g. While increasing ALA made no significant difference to coronary events it slightly reduced cardiovascular events. This means that the three combined (ALA and DHA combined) may reduce the risk of coronary but the effects are small. One of the ways of decreasing your risk of cardiovascular disease is by lowering your cholesterol—reducing saturated fats in your diet and eating ALA omega-3 (e.g. from walnuts). A grouped meta-analysis has not found any link between omega-3 and dementia but more information is needed to see if omega-3 can prevent cognitive decline. if you aren’t pregnant or intending to get pregnant then omega 3 supplements are probably unlikely to do you harm and might benefit your long-term cardiovascular risk. It isn’t possible to tell the difference in general between eating enough omega-3 in your diet versus supplementing but whole foods have other benefits as well. Omega-3 supplements often have high levels of vitamin A which can be harmful in pregnancy. Therefore you should avoid supplementing or choose a pregnancy-safe version. you may consider taking an omega-3 supplement made from algae or seaweed but these are unregulated and can contain significant quantities of iodine which can be harmful. Therefore to optimize your diet. There are concerns that part of the benefit of omega-3 is from a whole food effect that isn’t seen with taking a supplement instead. Tips on How to Get Enough Omega-3 in Your Diet Aim to have oily fish twice a week if you aren’t pregnant or once a week if you are as the benefit of omega-3 has to be offset by the risk of contamination with heavy metals. Algae and seaweed are the only plant-based sources of EPA and DHA but ALA can be converted in your body into EPA and DHA. Vegan sources of omega-3 are chia seeds such as rapeseed. To meet the current guidance for omega-3 you would need to eat about a tablespoon of chia or ground linseeds or two tablespoons of hemp seeds or six walnut halves a day. Algae oil is an alternative to fish oil which makes it an attractive option for vegetarians. But while algae oils do contain large amounts of DHA most don’t contain any EPA fatty acids at all. harvesting krill is not sustainable and there are risks regarding destabilizing the Antarctic food chain. Instead aim to include foods rich in omega-3 in your diet to benefit from the “whole food effect ” and eat foods that are naturally rich in carotenoids and lobster. Avoid taking high doses of cod liver oil and avoid it completely during pregnancy due to the risk of vitamin A. 5 Best Fish Oil Supplements to Buy For A Healthier Brain 11 Benefits of Fish Oil That You Didn’t Know About What Is Fish Oil Good For And Can It Give You Energy?

1620762114.068316,469545,https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_raspberrypi.asp,"With Node.js you can do amazing things with your Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi is a small It is developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation and it might be the most 
versatile tech ever created. Creator Eben Upton's goal was to create a low-cost device that would improve 
programming skills and hardware understanding. Due to the small size and price of the device it has become the center of a 
wide range of projects by tinkerers The Raspberry Pi has a row of GPIO (General Purpose input/output) pins and 
these can be used to interact in amazing ways with the real world. This tutorial 
will focus on how to use these with Node.js. For this tutorial you need a Raspberry Pi. In our examples we use a Raspberry Pi 3 but this tutorial should work for most versions. MicroSD memory card (We recommend a class 10 with 16 GB or higher) MicroSD to SD memory card adapter (usually included with the MicroSD card) Micro USB power supply to power the Raspberry Pi (2.5A or greater 
  recommended) WiFi/Ethernet Cable connection for the Raspberry Pi (Not needed for 
  Raspberry Pi 3 as it has built in WiFi) A working computer with internet and SD memory card reader (used to get the OS 
  (Operating System) for the Raspberry Pi onto the memory card). In our tutorial 
  we use a Windows computer for this but you can use a Mac or Linux computer if 
  you prefer USB keyboard (we need these only temporarily for the first 
  boot of the Raspberry Pi) For later chapters in this tutorial we will use special sensors or devices 
that we connect to the Raspberry Pi. We will specify these as special 
requirements in the relevant chapters. If you already have a Raspberry Pi set up with Raspbian you can skip to the step ""Install Node.js on Raspberry Pi"". Write Raspbian OS Image to MicroSD Card Before we can start using our Raspberry Pi for anything we need to get a OS 
installed. Raspbian is a free operating system based on Debian Linux and it is 
optimized Raspberry Pi. Download the latest Raspbian image from We use the ""LITE"" version in our tutorial since we are setting the Raspberry 
Pi up as a headless server (we will connect to it through SSH without having a 
keyboard/display connected to it). You can use whichever version you want but 
this tutorial is written with the ""LITE"" version as its focus. Insert the MicroSD memory card in your computer (via the SD adapter if 
needed). 
Open File Explorer to verify that it is operational. Etcher is a program for flashing images to memory cards. Download and 
install Etcher from: Click ""Select image"" button and find the Raspbian zip file that 
you downloaded. Click the ""Select drive"" button and specify the memory card as the target location. Click the ""Flash!"" button to write the image to the memory card. After Etcher is finished writing the image to the memory card remove it from your computer. To get the Raspberry Pi ready to boot we need to: Insert the MicroSD memory card into the Raspberry Pi Connect the USB Wi-Fi adapter (or Ethernet cable). Skip this step if you 
  are using a Raspberry Pi 3 Connect the micro USB power supply The Raspberry Pi should now be booting up When the Raspberry Pi is finished booting up Set Up Network on the Raspberry Pi If you will use a Ethernet cable to connect your Raspberry Pi to the 
internet you can skip this step. For this section we will assume you have a Raspberry Pi 3 Start by scanning for wireless networks: pi@raspberrypi:~ $ 
  sudo iwlist wlan0 scan This will list all of the available WiFi networks. (It also confirms that 
your WiFi is working) Now we need to open the wpa-supplicant file to add the network you want to 
connect to: pi@raspberrypi:~ $ sudo 
  nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf This will open the file in the Nano editor. Add the following to the bottom 
of the file (change with the actual network name and 
password): "" to save the code. Confirm with "" and confirm the name with "" and confirm that the WiFi is connected and working: If the WiFi is working propery the information displayed should include an 
IP address as we will use it to connect to the Raspberry Pi 
via SSH. Now your Raspberry Pi is connected to the internet it is time to enable SSH. SSH allows you up use the Raspberry Pi without having a monitor and keyboard 
connected to it. (You will need a SSH client for this on your non-Raspberry Pi computer. We use Open the Raspberry Pi Software Configuration Tool: You should see a menu like this: and you should be in the main menu again. and follow the instructions to change the password. Choose a secure password but something you will remember: After you have finished changing the password you should be back in the main menu. and follow the instructions to change the hostname: After you have finished changing the hostname you should be back in the main menu. Now we will close the menu and save the changes: you will get the option to reboot. Select You can now unplug the monitor and keyboard from the Raspberry Pi and we can log in using out SSH client. type in the IP address for your Raspberry Pi and the new password you specified. You should now see a command line like this: (we used w3demopi as our hostname) You are now able to run your Raspberry Pi in ""Headless-mode"" meaning you do not need a monitor or keyboard. And if you have a WiFi connection you do not need a ethernet cable either With the Raspberry Pi properly set up and update your Raspberry Pi system packages to their latest versions. Upgrade all your installed packages to their latest version: Doing this regularly will keep your Raspberry Pi installation up to date. To download and install newest version of Node.js pi@w3demopi:~ $ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash - pi@w3demopi:~ $ sudo apt-get install -y nodejs Check that the installation was successful and the version number of

Python Type Conversion and Type Casting you will learn about the Type conversion and uses of type conversion. The process of converting the value of one data type (integer etc.) to another data type is called type conversion. Python has two types of type conversion. Python automatically converts one data type to another data type. This process doesn't need any user involvement. Let's see an example where Python promotes the conversion of the lower data type (integer) to the higher data type (float) to avoid data loss. Example 1: Converting integer to float num_int = 123
num_flo = 1.23

num_new = num_int + num_flo

print(""datatype of num_int:"" When we run the above program datatype of num_int: <class 'int'>
datatype of num_flo: <class 'float'>

Value of num_new: 124.23
datatype of num_new: <class 'float'> We will look at the data type of all three objects respectively. we can see the data type of data type because Python always converts smaller data types to larger data types to avoid the loss of data. let's try adding a string and an integer and see how Python deals with it. Example 2: Addition of string(higher) data type and integer(lower) datatype num_int = 123
num_str = ""456""

print(""Data type of num_int:"" When we run the above program Data type of num_int: <class 'int'> 
Data type of num_str: <class 'str'> 

Traceback (most recent call last): 
  File ""python"" in <module> 
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str' As we can see from the output . Python is not able to use Implicit Conversion in such conditions. Python has a solution for these types of situations which is known as Explicit Conversion. users convert the data type of an object to required data type. We use the predefined functions like etc to perform explicit type conversion. This type of conversion is also called typecasting because the user casts (changes) the data type of the objects. Typecasting can be done by assigning the required data type function to the expression. Example 3: Addition of string and integer using explicit conversion num_int = 123
num_str = ""456""

print(""Data type of num_int:"" type(num_int))
print(""Data type of num_str before Type Casting:"" type(num_str))

num_str = int(num_str)
print(""Data type of num_str after Type Casting:"" type(num_str))

num_sum = num_int + num_str

print(""Sum of num_int and num_str:"" When we run the above program Data type of num_int: <class 'int'>
Data type of num_str before Type Casting: <class 'str'>

Data type of num_str after Type Casting: <class 'int'>

Sum of num_int and num_str: 579
Data type of the sum: <class 'int'> from string(higher) to integer(lower) type using Python is able to add these two variables. value and data type to be an integer. Type Conversion is the conversion of object from one data type to another data type. Implicit Type Conversion is automatically performed by the Python interpreter. Python avoids the loss of data in Implicit Type Conversion. Explicit Type Conversion is also called Type Casting the data types of objects are converted using predefined functions by the user. loss of data may occur as we enforce the object to a specific data type.

1620762135.680279,73115238,https://hackaday.com/2021/05/11/the-mysterious-wobble-of-muons/,You might think that particle physicists would be sad when an experiment comes up with different results than their theory would predict but nothing brightens up a field like unexplained phenomena.  Indeed particle physicists have been feverishly looking for deviations from the Standard Model. This year there have been tantalizing signs that a long unresolved discrepancy between theory and experiment will be confirmed by new experimental results. the quest to measure the magnetic moment of muons started more than 60 years ago and this has been measured ever more precisely since. From an experiment in 1959 at CERN in Switzerland to the turn of the century at Brookhaven to this year’s result at Fermilab the magnetic moment of the muon seems to be at odds with theoretical predictions. Although a statistical fluke is basically excluded this value also relies on complex theoretical calculations that are not all in agreement. Instead of heralding a new era of physics it might just be another headline too good to be true. But some physicists are mumbling “new particle” in hushed tones. Let’s see what all the fuss is about. The muon is often called the big brother of the electron: it is an elementary particle with a negative charge and it is about 200 times heavier than its little brother. Muons are omnipresent because they are produced when cosmic rays smash into the atoms of our atmosphere. If you hold out your hand there is probably a muon going through it every second. To study muons they can also be artificially produced using particle accelerators that mimic the reactions occurring in our atmosphere. The generated muon beam can then be circulated and stored in a big magnetic ring. Muons have a spin and charge that creates a magnetic moment which measures the strength and orientation of its magnetic field. You can imagine muons like tiny permanent magnets whose orientation aligns when they are placed in an external magnetic field. The “g-factor” is a dimensionless proportionality constant between the magnetic moment and the spin. one can calculate the g-factor for muons (or electrons) from the which gives a value of exactly 2. But this is not the whole truth: in quantum electrodynamics (QED) can pop in and out of existence so long as they do so quickly enough that they fall under the cover of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. This in-and-out-of-existance loop leads to correction terms in the calculations. For the muon loop corrections lead to a g-factor that is not exactly 2 but and the difference is referred to as the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. All You Need Is a Giant Magnet Experimental setup of the g-2 experiment at CERN. Muons enter the magnet at the lower left and then propagate in a spiral path to the right where they exit and are analyzed. CERN decided to run an experiment that should test the validity of quantum electrodynamics which predicted the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Ignoring the usual tradition to come up with a creative acronym the experiment was simply called “g-2” (pronounced “gee minus two”). a beam of protons from CERN’s synchrocyclotron was shot onto a target to produce a beam of pions that immediately decay into muons. This muon beam then entered a six meter long magnet. The magnetic field was oriented vertically to the muon beam which caused the muons to curve into a circular path. The magnetic field also varied from the left to the right which was achieved by carefully inserting exactly calculated shims into the magnet. This caused the muons to slowly drift from left to right making a spiral curve. the spin of the muons is wobbling (precessing) just like the spin of protons in an MRI machine. At the right end of the magnet the muons are ejected and the direction of their spin relative to their momentum is analyzed. From this measurement the anomalous magnetic moment can be calculated because it is sensitive to the difference between the orbital frequency and the spin precession frequency. Only six months after the start of g = 2.001165±5 which agreed well with the theoretical value at that time and thus confirmed the validity of QED. In the coming years a second experiment with 25 times better accuracy actually found a difference between theory and measurement but this vanished after theorists refined their models. A third and final experiment at CERN confirmed this new theoretical results with an astonishing accuracy of 0.0007% (7 ppm). The Tension Between Theory and Experiment the US took over in investigating the muon anomalous magnetic moment. Using the proton accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) their experiment introduced several improvements over the CERN measurements. These included a higher proton intensity a 14 m diameter superconducting magnet — the largest in the world at that time —  more efficient muon injection and electrostatic focusing of the muon beam as well as custom-made 400 MHz waveform digitizers. The aim of the experiment was to achieve an accuracy of 0.35 ppm in order to check the loop corrections caused by W and Z-bosons which were discovered the year before at CERN. To obtain an objective result the collaboration used a “blind analysis”. This is a common technique used in particle physics to avoid the unintended bias towards a certain result by the people analyzing the data. It is similar to the double-blind randomized clinical trial used in medical research. In the BNL experiment the data analysis to obtain the two frequencies from which g-2 could be calculated was carried out by two different teams. In addition each frequency had an artificially introduced offset which was unknown to the data analysis team and was only subtracted after the result had been fixed. When the final data-taking run ended in 2001 the was in disagreement with theory by 2.2 – 2.7 standard deviations depending on the theoretical calculation. This caused much discussion of whether it could be a hint towards new physics because yet undiscovered particles would lead to additional correction terms to the theoretically calculated value. As with every other result there is of course the less spectacular possibility that it is merely a statistical fluctuation which at 2.7 standard deviations is unlikely but as history has proven not at all impossible. Another boring explanation would be some unaccounted systematic error in the experiment. And the theoretical value is not itself bulletproof. This is because there are large corrections from particle loops that involve strongly interacting particles that cannot be calculated from theory. Instead theorists use measured production rates from other experiments for these particles to approximate the correction term. Summary of the theoretical and experimental values for g-2. The theoretical consensus value is in tension with the experimental results while new lattice calculations agree with their uncertainties. the superconducting magnet of the BNL experiment was transported 3 200 miles to Fermilab near Chicago in order to repeat the experiment using their more intense muon beam. The result was eagerly awaited by the physics community as the tension between theory and experiment had been standing unresolved for the last 20 years. A few weeks ago Fermilab published their that was again obtained by a blind analysis where the frequency of their main clock was entrusted to two other physicists outside of the collaboration. After unblinding the data it became clear that the result confirms the BNL measurement. The combined tension between theory and experiment amounts now to 4.2 standard deviations which is just a bit short of the 5 standard deviation threshold to claim a new discovery. Still the difference between the theoretical and experimental values is large enough that the chances of it happening randomly is about 1 to 40 000. An experimental screw-up is also unlikely now that the result is confirmed by two independent experiments even though they use the same technique and some of the same equipment. the theoretical value might be to blame. In fact on the same day that Fermilab published their result but already available since last year as a arrives at a value that is actually compatible with the experimental data. This new theoretical value was completely calculated from scratch using so-called lattice calculations running on a supercomputer. However the result is far from the theoretical consensus value and has still to be confirmed by other independent calculations. But as mentioned earlier it already happened before that the tension between theory and experiment vanished after theorists reevaluated their model. When theory and experiment hone each other So it is still unclear if the current Standard Model of particle physics has finally been cracked open. Many people doubt that the g-2 result is due to a new particle because we should have already seen it in current particle colliders like the LHC. On the other hand it could be just around the corner to be found by current or near-future colliders. In the meantime Fermilab is already busy analyzing some of their more recent data and is still continuing data taking so we can expect a more accurate g-2 value soon. The topic is definitely one of the most exciting in particle physics right now and it is worth keeping an eye on it. Please be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

You can never stop learning so it’s more critical than ever to have the right tools for learning at your disposal and keep yourself on that path. Whether you are a student or a professional continuing your education the year 2020 has proved to be a metaphorical wrench thrown in the wheels of your learning. You found yourself physically isolated from your tribes and disconnected from your technology came to the rescue and many companies put out great new tools for learning meant to fill that very gap. but they took off as their popularity exploded in recent years. You should take from this that these tools are not only saving grace in dire times but you can also use them in your day-to-day process to make learning more efficient. There are many aspects of learning I wanted to focus on four primary areas that are critical when it comes to distance learning or learning on your own: – the basic source of knowledge – finding and accessing your knowledgebase easily “Learn as though you would never be able to master it; hold it as though you would be in fear of losing it.”—Confucius Reading - The Source of Knowledge Archiving and Maintaining Your Knowledge Base Bonus: Brain Training - Keeping Yourself Sharp Reading – The Source of Knowledge That’s why I believe that two apps will come very handy to allow you to identify what to read while also getting a few golden nuggets along the way. These apps are also beneficial when trying to find something new to learn . They will help you sort through the tons of books out there and quickly figure out what sparks your interest. and my biggest problem after going through the essential books on specific topics is finding new things to learn from. Especially since self-publishing became a thing it’s becoming harder and harder to sort through all the options out there and pick something that will help and that you will enjoy and I must’ve read about fifty different books due to that. Blinkist picks books and summarizes them in a series of short audio snippets called blinks. Typically a Blinkist entry takes about 15 minutes to listen to (or read The app has a robust tagging system so you can select the books you need based on the type or based on others you’ve already read. This app will improve your efficiency in identifying new books to read and learn from. Also it will help you waste a minimal amount of time finding out what books you shouldn’t waste your time on. but it’s a newer addition to the market. Their app is clean and the user interface is intuitive and easy to use. The tool is excellent at identifying your reading patterns and suggests what to read next based on your history. Although their library is not as extensive as Blinkist’s for the time being they put efforts into creating summaries for new books that hit the shelves as well as some of the more widely known non-fiction books. I must have gone through a dozen courses in the last year and I found them easy to digest and consume and highly efficient. You can install these tools on your phone or tablet and use them while driving Because the courses have different levels you can start from a beginner course and see if that works for you. Later you can upgrade to higher levels and continue to learn on that subject. You’ll find it particularly effective to combine a book you’ve identified with a course available on one of these apps in the same category. Udemy is a site and app that provides online learning through video courses. The content is varied and it’s geared toward personal and professional development. and finding what you need is straightforward. Because thousands of users are using the app you benefit from many reviews and testimonials for each course. The one drawback for Udemy is that they don’t have a subscription model so if you want to take many classes you have to pay for each one individually. However the app often provides significant discounts as the company is trying to attract more students. and it’s one of my to-go every time I want to learn something new. Coursera is another excellent tool for learning especially if you are looking to get a certificate and use it to apply for a job. Unlike Udemy Coursera is more focused on academics you can get a certificate that attests that you’ve completed the course. It’s not surprising that Coursera offers such accreditation since two professors from Stanford University created the platform. Currently the site claims to have served 70 million students in 2020 with a year-over-year growth of 60% which is a pretty impressive number. What I love about Coursera is that they provide a subscription model that gives you access to all courses with certificates included. Of course so they are perfectly designed for effective learning from home or on the go. If Coursera is geared mainly toward professional skills The Great Courses offers a broader variety of classes for almost every hobby you can think of. The Great Courses has an upgrade program called The Great Courses Plus which offers a subscription model that gives unlimited access to their rich content. One great thing about The Great Courses is that they have professionally designed video courses led by some of the world’s best instructors and masters of each field. In addition to having a user-friendly interface The Great Courses also integrates directly into the Roku TV player and is also available on Amazon Kindle. Keep in mind that retaining doesn’t mean blindly memorizing everything you read or hear. It means organizing the essential aspects of what you learn in a way that makes it easy to search and access when you need it. That is why it’s important to have a system in place that is always at your fingertips and allows you to accumulate and create your personal learning database. Such tools for learning will organize and logically connect all the bits and pieces of your education. At a later time you’ll be able to retrieve the information and use it effectively. Anki is a tool that will help you remember what you learn and retain information with more precision and for a longer time. It’s a study method that mimics that of paper flashcards but its creators designed it to be more efficient than other traditional learning methods. The basic idea is that the system adapts to your current level and adjusts your learning accordingly. So let’s say you are learning a new language and you go through a set of flashcards. The app registers the answers you know and you won’t get those question cards again for two weeks. Those that you don’t know at all will appear again tomorrow. By focusing on the power of repetition but avoiding things you already know well you will learn and retain information highly efficiently. One of the best things about Anki? It’s free. The second best thing? You can find it as a download for both Windows and Mac and also on mobile devices. Anki is an excellent tool for learning that will improve your memory and save you lots of time. Quizlet is another app that aims to help you retain information. It’s a study aid that turns a simplistic flashcard system into a full-fledged learning system through its intelligent features. Quizlet is a perfect tool for learning at home at your own pace. The AI features built in the app allow it to adapt your learning path over time by targeting those areas where you struggle and limiting the recycling of information you’ve already got a good grip on. it might look like this app is limited to K-12 students. Still it’s very well suited for advanced learners including university students and professionals who want to sharpen their knowledge and skills. Archiving and Maintaining Your Knowledge Base The goal here is to have the notes from your courses and labeled so that you can retrieve them with a few clicks. Diigo is a beautiful addition to your tools for learning arsenal. As the time you spend online grows the chances you encounter interesting information increases as well. There are opportunities to learn all around you but often they fly right by due to the sheer volume and speed of information—but not if you use a tool like Diigo. Diigo is a personal information management and organization system that allows you to bookmark and archive any information you encounter on the web. You capture data on the go and you put it in your learning queue for later. Evernote is one of the veteran apps in the note-taking universe. It started in the early 2000s and was among the first companies to fully embrace mobile integration and cross-device synchronization. There are similarities between Diigo and Evernote but the main difference is that Diigo is focused on collecting content whereas Evernote also allows users to create content. You can take notes using their intuitive WYSIWYG editor and share and organize them in folders I believe Evernote is a crucial app to use if you want to become more efficient in your learning. Their apps allow you to take photo snapshots and archive them. If the scan can be converted to text then it is also indexed for easy search. Notion is a lot more than a note-taking app. It’s an entire system that you can set up as your personal learning hub. At its core Notion is a database that you can design to hold your notes intuitively and provides you easy access to your information. Because it works with any media you can save video webinars or entire books or PDFs. There’s almost nothing that you can’t do in Notion and it almost sounds too good to be true. of course. Notion has a little bit of a learning curve and most people don’t find it easy to use from the get-go. But with a bit of practice and a little time I think it will do wonders for your learning and soon you will drop all other methods of collecting knowledge. Bonus: Brain Training – Keeping Yourself Sharp Small bursts of brain activation over time will improve your creative thinking and will make your brain more effective at learning. So I consider these apps an integral part of your tools for learning arsenal. Because we are looking at improving your effectiveness these tools are perfect because they provide small lessons and exercises that can be practice anytime and won’t take long. You might find yourself opening these apps while waiting in a long line at the grocery store or while waiting to see your doctor. they provide you with a quick and effective way to sharpen your brain which will improve your ability to learn and retain information over time. Here are three excellent brain training apps to help you boost your learning. Every one of us has room to grow and when learning falls at the bottom of our priority list you will plateau sooner or later. Only by allocating deliberate and showing up every day will you be able to grow and lead a happier and fulfilled life. When you learn on your own at home the danger is falling prey to procrastination or lacking direction. That is why having the right tools for learning at your disposal is so critical. They will improve your efficiency and help you track your progress these tools for learning are just the beginning. I urge you never to stop questioning your status quo and constantly asking yourself “what else can I learn? Where else can I find information that is easy to get and will help me and my life?” How To Learn Faster And Smarter (Your Complete Guide) How to Become Self-Taught the Easy Way (The How-to Guide) 9 Steps to Make Self-Regulated Learning More Effective How To Find Motivation To Learn Anything Outside of Comfort Zone 5 Learning Management Systems (LMS) for Effective Learning 10 Tools That Make Learning At Home More Efficient How to Know Which Types of Learning Styles Work for You?

One of the biggest realizations I had as a kid is that teaching in school could be hit or miss for students. We all have our own different . Even when I was in study groups we all had our own ways of uncovering solutions to questions. It wasn’t only until later in my life did I realize how important it is to know your own learning style. As soon as you know how you learn and the best way to learn you can better retain information. This information could be crucial to your job and overall excelling in life. Best of all about this information is that it’s not hard to figure out what works best for you. There are broad categories of learning styles so it’s a matter of finding which one we gravitate towards most. What Are the Types of Learning Styles? How to Know Which One(s) Suit You Better? What Are the Types of Learning Styles? No matter how old you are studies show that repetition allows us to retain and learn new information. The big question now is what kind of repetition is needed. After all we all learn and process information differently. This is where the types of learning styles come in. There are eight in total and there is one or two that we prefer over others. This is important because when reading these learning styles you’ll feel like you’d prefer a mixture of these styles. That’s because we do prefer a combination. Though there will be one style that will be more predominate over the others. The key is finding which one it is. If you are this type of learner you likely excelled at geometry in math class but struggled with arithmetic and numbers. To this day you might also struggle with reading and writing to a degree. While visual learners are described as “late bloomers ” they are highly imaginative. They also process what they see much faster than what they hear. and speech classes. But give them maps or challenge them to think outside of the box and they’ll struggle a bit. They can also analyze cause and effect relationships quite well. Part of that is due to their thinking process being linear. Another big difference is their need to quantify everything. These people love grouping information They also have a love for strategy games and making calculations in their heads. These learners also have a great memory of conversations and love debates and discussions. Chances are likely these people excel at anything oral. these individuals have great musical talents. They can decern notes rhythms and tones. That being said they will have a tough time interpreting body language expressions and gestures. This also applies to charts These are the people who are excited for group conversations or group projects. Mainly because they are gifted with coming up with ideas and discussing them. They also have a good understanding of people’s emotions and relationship dynamics. They are also likely the first people to point out the root causes of communication issues. This type of learning style means you love learning something on your own and typically every day. You also have innate skills in managing yourself and indulging in self-reflection. This means not just pottery or shop class you enjoyed. You may also have loved sports or any other art medium like painting or woodwork. Anything that involved you learning through physical manipulation you enjoyed and excelled at. Though this doesn’t just apply to direct physical activities. A physical learner may also find that they learn well when both reading on any subject and pacing or bouncing your leg at the same time. Not many people may be connected to this one out of the types of learning styles primarily because of those facts. Furthermore those who excel in this learning end up being farmers These are the people who love everything with nature. They appreciate plants and rural settings deeply compared to others. How to Know Which One(s) Suit You Better? Which one(s) are best for you? all of us learn through a combination of these learning styles. This makes pinpointing these styles difficult since our learning is likely a fusion of two or more of those styles. there are all kinds of methods to narrow down which learner you are. Let’s explore the most popular one: the VARK model. It takes the eight types of learning styles above and condenses them into four categories: Visual – those who learn from sight. Auditory – those who learn from hearing. Reading/writing – those who learn from reading and writing. Kinesthetic – those who learn from doing and moving. But why use this particular model? This model was created not only for discussion purposes but for learners to know a few key things — namely understanding how they learn. Because our school system is focusing on a one-size-fits-all model there are many of us who struggle learning in school. While we may no longer go to school these behaviors persisted into our adult lives regardless. While we aren’t learning about algebra or science we may be learning new things about our job or industry. Knowing how to best retain that information for the future helps in so many ways. it can be frustrating when we’re in a classroom setting and aren’t understanding anything. That or maybe we’re listening to a speech or reading a book and have no clue what’s going on. This is where VARK comes back in. To quote Fleming and Baume: “VARK above all is designed to be a starting place for a conversation among teachers and learners about learning. It can also be a catalyst for staff development- thinking about strategies for teaching different groups can lead to more variety of learning and teaching.” It helps you to understand how you learn and who you are. Think of it as a higher order of thinking that takes control over how you learn. It’s impossible to not use this while learning. we can pinpoint the different types of learning styles that we use. More importantly what style we prefer over others. If you don’t want to be using a lot of brainpower to pinpoint The idea with this method is to answer a few questions. Since our learning is a combination of styles you’ll find yourself leaning to one side over the other with these questions: The active/reflective scale: How do you prefer to process information? The sensing/intuitive scale: How do you prefer to take in information? The visual/verbal scale: How do you prefer information to be presented? The sequential/global scale: How do you prefer to organize information? Our brain is made of various parts and whatever style we learn activates certain parts of the brain. Because of this fact it would be wise to consider other methods of learning and to give them a try. Each method I mentioned has its merits and there’s not one dominate or superior method. What method we like is entirely up to our preferences. So be flexible with those preferences and uncover what style works best for you.

Let us see the output section first. function to output data to the standard output device (screen). We can also but this will be discussed later. An example of its use is given below. This sentence is output to the screen a = 5

It defaults into a space character. is printed. It defaults into a new line. is the object where the values are printed and its default value is (screen). Here is an example to illustrate this. Sometimes we would like to format our output to make it look attractive. This can be done by using the method. This method is visible to any string object. >>> x = 5; y = 10
>>> print('The value of x is {} and y is {}'.format(x y))
The value of x is 5 and y is 10 are used as placeholders. We can specify the order in which they are printed by using numbers (tuple index). I love bread and butter
I love butter and bread We can even use keyword arguments to format the string. We can also format strings like the old >>> x = 12.3456789
>>> print('The value of x is %3.2f' %x)
The value of x is 12.35
>>> print('The value of x is %3.4f' %x)
The value of x is 12.3457 our programs were static. The value of variables was defined or hard coded into the source code. we might want to take the input from the user. In Python function to allow this. The syntax for is the string we wish to display on the screen. It is optional. >>> num = input('Enter a number: ')
Enter a number: 10
>>> num
'10' we can see that the entered value not a number. To convert this into a number we can use This same operation can be performed using the takes it further. It can evaluate even expressions provided the input is a string >>> int('2+3')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<string>"" in runcode

A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. have a filename and end with the extension Definitions inside a module can be imported to another module or the interactive interpreter in Python. We use the module by typing the following line: We can use the module in the following ways: module are available in our scope.

This year there have been tantalizing signs that a long unresolved discrepancy between theory and experiment will be confirmed by new experimental results. the quest to measure the magnetic moment of muons started more than 60 years ago and this has been measured ever more precisely since. From an experiment in 1959 at CERN in Switzerland to the turn of the century at Brookhaven to this year’s result at Fermilab the magnetic moment of the muon seems to be at odds with theoretical predictions. Although a statistical fluke is basically excluded this value also relies on complex theoretical calculations that are not all in agreement. Instead of heralding a new era of physics it might just be another headline too good to be true. But some physicists are mumbling “new particle” in hushed tones. Let’s see what all the fuss is about. The muon is often called the big brother of the electron: it is an elementary particle with a negative charge and it is about 200 times heavier than its little brother. Muons are omnipresent because they are produced when cosmic rays smash into the atoms of our atmosphere. If you hold out your hand there is probably a muon going through it every second. To study muons they can also be artificially produced using particle accelerators that mimic the reactions occurring in our atmosphere. The generated muon beam can then be circulated and stored in a big magnetic ring. Muons have a spin and charge that creates a magnetic moment which measures the strength and orientation of its magnetic field. You can imagine muons like tiny permanent magnets whose orientation aligns when they are placed in an external magnetic field. The “g-factor” is a dimensionless proportionality constant between the magnetic moment and the spin. one can calculate the g-factor for muons (or electrons) from the which gives a value of exactly 2. But this is not the whole truth: in quantum electrodynamics (QED) can pop in and out of existence so long as they do so quickly enough that they fall under the cover of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. This in-and-out-of-existance loop leads to correction terms in the calculations. For the muon loop corrections lead to a g-factor that is not exactly 2 but and the difference is referred to as the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. All You Need Is a Giant Magnet Experimental setup of the g-2 experiment at CERN. Muons enter the magnet at the lower left and then propagate in a spiral path to the right where they exit and are analyzed. CERN decided to run an experiment that should test the validity of quantum electrodynamics which predicted the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Ignoring the usual tradition to come up with a creative acronym the experiment was simply called “g-2” (pronounced “gee minus two”). a beam of protons from CERN’s synchrocyclotron was shot onto a target to produce a beam of pions that immediately decay into muons. This muon beam then entered a six meter long magnet. The magnetic field was oriented vertically to the muon beam which caused the muons to curve into a circular path. The magnetic field also varied from the left to the right which was achieved by carefully inserting exactly calculated shims into the magnet. This caused the muons to slowly drift from left to right making a spiral curve. the spin of the muons is wobbling (precessing) just like the spin of protons in an MRI machine. At the right end of the magnet the muons are ejected and the direction of their spin relative to their momentum is analyzed. From this measurement the anomalous magnetic moment can be calculated because it is sensitive to the difference between the orbital frequency and the spin precession frequency. Only six months after the start of g = 2.001165±5 which agreed well with the theoretical value at that time and thus confirmed the validity of QED. In the coming years a second experiment with 25 times better accuracy actually found a difference between theory and measurement but this vanished after theorists refined their models. A third and final experiment at CERN confirmed this new theoretical results with an astonishing accuracy of 0.0007% (7 ppm). The Tension Between Theory and Experiment the US took over in investigating the muon anomalous magnetic moment. Using the proton accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) their experiment introduced several improvements over the CERN measurements. These included a higher proton intensity a 14 m diameter superconducting magnet — the largest in the world at that time —  more efficient muon injection and electrostatic focusing of the muon beam as well as custom-made 400 MHz waveform digitizers. The aim of the experiment was to achieve an accuracy of 0.35 ppm in order to check the loop corrections caused by W and Z-bosons which were discovered the year before at CERN. To obtain an objective result the collaboration used a “blind analysis”. This is a common technique used in particle physics to avoid the unintended bias towards a certain result by the people analyzing the data. It is similar to the double-blind randomized clinical trial used in medical research. In the BNL experiment the data analysis to obtain the two frequencies from which g-2 could be calculated was carried out by two different teams. In addition each frequency had an artificially introduced offset which was unknown to the data analysis team and was only subtracted after the result had been fixed. When the final data-taking run ended in 2001 the was in disagreement with theory by 2.2 – 2.7 standard deviations depending on the theoretical calculation. This caused much discussion of whether it could be a hint towards new physics because yet undiscovered particles would lead to additional correction terms to the theoretically calculated value. As with every other result there is of course the less spectacular possibility that it is merely a statistical fluctuation which at 2.7 standard deviations is unlikely but as history has proven not at all impossible. Another boring explanation would be some unaccounted systematic error in the experiment. And the theoretical value is not itself bulletproof. This is because there are large corrections from particle loops that involve strongly interacting particles that cannot be calculated from theory. Instead theorists use measured production rates from other experiments for these particles to approximate the correction term. Summary of the theoretical and experimental values for g-2. The theoretical consensus value is in tension with the experimental results while new lattice calculations agree with their uncertainties. the superconducting magnet of the BNL experiment was transported 3 200 miles to Fermilab near Chicago in order to repeat the experiment using their more intense muon beam. The result was eagerly awaited by the physics community as the tension between theory and experiment had been standing unresolved for the last 20 years. A few weeks ago Fermilab published their that was again obtained by a blind analysis where the frequency of their main clock was entrusted to two other physicists outside of the collaboration. After unblinding the data it became clear that the result confirms the BNL measurement. The combined tension between theory and experiment amounts now to 4.2 standard deviations which is just a bit short of the 5 standard deviation threshold to claim a new discovery. Still the difference between the theoretical and experimental values is large enough that the chances of it happening randomly is about 1 to 40 000. An experimental screw-up is also unlikely now that the result is confirmed by two independent experiments even though they use the same technique and some of the same equipment. the theoretical value might be to blame. In fact on the same day that Fermilab published their result but already available since last year as a arrives at a value that is actually compatible with the experimental data. This new theoretical value was completely calculated from scratch using so-called lattice calculations running on a supercomputer. However the result is far from the theoretical consensus value and has still to be confirmed by other independent calculations. But as mentioned earlier it already happened before that the tension between theory and experiment vanished after theorists reevaluated their model. When theory and experiment hone each other So it is still unclear if the current Standard Model of particle physics has finally been cracked open. Many people doubt that the g-2 result is due to a new particle because we should have already seen it in current particle colliders like the LHC. On the other hand it could be just around the corner to be found by current or near-future colliders. In the meantime Fermilab is already busy analyzing some of their more recent data and is still continuing data taking so we can expect a more accurate g-2 value soon. The topic is definitely one of the most exciting in particle physics right now and it is worth keeping an eye on it. Please be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

It’s a hot topic—and it should be. One study showed that not sleeping enough is basically like being drunk. When they measured the accuracy in shooting a target in the military after sleeping a certain amount of hours they found that men who slept for more than 7 hours had an accuracy of 98%. For those who slept 6 hours the accuracy dropped to 50%. That’s almost a 50% drop! But it gets worse: those who slept for 5 hours had an accuracy of only 23% and those who slept for less than 5 hours had an accuracy of 13%. Yes not sleeping enough is basically like being drunk! Sleep doesn’t only influence your accuracy but it also affects other areas of your life: Mentally: you can’t focus well or remember important information Somatically: your body feels achy and sore the inflammation in your body goes up and all kinds of health issues arise why is it important to not only sleep enough but also have a steady sleep schedule? Your body needs a rhythm. The wake-sleep cycle is also called the circadian rhythm. It’s a constant play between cortisol and melatonin. Cortisol is your get-up-and-go hormone in the morning. It gets activated with sunlight. Melatonin is your sleep hormone and can only increase when cortisol goes down in the evening. I know you thought of stress when I mentioned cortisol and you’re right about that. Cortisol goes up when we are stressed have an infection or inflammation in the body and when we are digesting food. If you’re that person who wakes up at 2 am and can’t fall back asleep that is your cortisol speaking. It’s too high and I’ll share with you five tips on how to fix your sleep schedule. Everybody is different. Find what works for you. Do you feel most rested when you sleep early and wake up early? Or are you more of an evening person who’s more productive when sleeping late and waking up late? and pick your sleep schedule. Don’t worry if you’re not sure about it. Look at it as an experiment. Pick your time of going to bed and your time of waking up and test it out for a week. Doesn’t feel right? Switch it up until you find a rhythm that feels good. Need some extra support to fix your schedule? Take the There’s an interesting 15-minute video training at the end to know more about the effects on your sleep when you exercise 2. Create a 5-Minute Morning Routine Five minutes is enough to tell your body that it’s time to wake up and to prime your brain to be in the right mood and to feel positive. In those first five minutes of the day your brain wakes up and switches from a subconscious state to a conscious state. This basically means that any input you get and anything you do in those first five minutes will set the tone for the rest of your day. If you wake up in a rush you turn on your WiFi right away and check your messages you think of everything you still need to do and run out the door those influence the rest of your day. Your mind feels scattered you don’t feel fully present and your stress levels go through the roof. so that you can wake up feeling more well-rested and in control of your day. Create a set of habits that you can repeat every day so your brain doesn’t need to make decisions yet like waking up and drinking a glass of water with lime thinking of three things you’re grateful for looking out the window with a cup of tea or going for a quick walk to get some sunlight in. Soaking up that sunlight in the morning will even help you fall asleep faster at night. 3. Calm Down Your Brain in the Evening Another tip on how to fix your sleep schedule is learning how to calm down your brain in the evening. It’s important to prepare your body and your brain for sleep. We want our cortisol levels to go down so that melatonin can go up. If we’re still receiving lots of input from social media or we’re engaging in a heated discussion our brain will still be up-and-running processing the information and emotions swirling around instead of slowing down for a good night’s sleep. How can you create an evening wind-down of one or preferably two hours before going to sleep where you completely disconnect and relax your system? focus on output instead of input. We are living in such an input society where we keep consuming more information and new impulses through the media. We’re making our brains work overtime answering more messages. What kind of output can you focus on? find something you can do that can either come out of you instead of putting new things in or something that can give your brain a break by doing something more physical like stretching . The blue light from your phone or laptop screen will block melatonin production. If you do need to watch a screen install a blue light filter. This will create a red glow on your screen in the evenings so that your eyes can rest and melatonin doesn’t get blocked. Depending on your device and system you can find many great free options. don’t eat or drink anything before going to sleep. Like mentioned before cortisol goes up when you’re digesting food. Try not to eat or drink anything at least two hours before bedtime. If you do feel hungry go for good protein options instead of carbohydrates. There are even foods with protein that stimulate the production of melatonin like almonds. If you do want to drink something go for some relaxing tea like chamomile Make sure your bedroom is super sleep-friendly with a good quality mattress good blinds to block the light from interrupting your sleep and make sure it’s not too humid or hot. It’s worth investing in the greatest sleep circumstances. You spend about 33 years of your life in bed! Use your bed only for sleeping and making love. We need to train our brains in our favor. If we tell our brains that the bed is only a place for sleep it will respect that and help us fall asleep faster. if you sometimes use your laptop in the bed scroll your social media feed your brain will think it can start doing other mental activities when you’re actually just trying to sleep. If you can’t fall asleep and your brain is racing read a book in the living room drink some lavender tea or diffuse some lavender oil and try again. Don’t just twist and turn in the bed hoping you’ll fall asleep soon. To train our brains to fall asleep faster and respect our sleep schedule it’s better to get up and then come back to try again. 5. Bring Down Your Stress Levels Last but not least on how to fix your sleep schedule you need to keep your cortisol levels low. It can peak for short moments and that is totally natural. But when you are chronically stressed and your cortisol is high all the time the effects on your health can be detrimental. This is why it’s so important to work on your stress management skills. Which tools do you have in your toolbox already that you can use? What gives you that feeling of calmness? How can you do more of that especially during your evening wind down? You can either try different stress management practices at home or get help from a stress coach: Find out what fits you as a person and what you can easily implement even when life gets in the way. We all fall off the wagon and forget about these practices now and then. It’s never too late to get back on that horse and restart a regular relaxation practice. “Sleep is that golden chain that ties health and our bodies together.”—Thomas Dekker High levels of cortisol don’t always come from mental stress. It can be physical stress too when your immune system is fighting against bacteria or certain foods. If you feel that might be the case it is worth investigating more into your physical health and finding where the inflammation in your body is coming from.

There are hundreds of probiotic brands on the market and many more websites and blogs dedicated to the benefits of probiotics on the internet. But how much do you really know about probiotics and their benefits? Scientific studies have provided evidence for many of the benefits of probiotics that you have probably already read about. The important thing to know is which benefits are real and which are not! It’s also important to understand that there are many different strains of probiotics and each strain performs different roles within the body. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria that live within your intestines. They play a huge variety of important roles in many bodily processes. They help with digesting food They’re also important for energy production You can get your probiotic bacteria from supplements or food. Popular probiotic foods include sauerkraut but there are many more. Let’s look at the six most popular health benefits of probiotics and the evidence for each. Yes! The billions of microbes residing in your gut play a vital role in breaking down the food you eat and absorbing the nutrients within. Probiotics break down the food you eat into energy-boosting B vitamins. These B vitamins play important roles in releasing energy from carbohydrates and fat as well as breaking down amino acids and transporting oxygen and energy-containing nutrients around the body. Each B vitamin plays an important role in producing energy. Vitamin B1 is involved with the cellular production of energy as part of glucose metabolism. It also helps convert carbohydrates to fat which can be stored until needed. Vitamin B2 is a building block for two coenzymes that help carry hydrogen which is used to create ATP when carbohydrates and fats are metabolized. Vitamin B3 is involved with two coenzymes that play a key role in glycolysis in which energy is created from carbohydrates and sugar. Vitamin B5 is also part of the cellular metabolism of carbohydrates and fats to create energy. Vitamin B6 aids the release of glycogen from the liver and muscles so your body can use it for energy. The strains Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium assist with the absorption of minerals such as iron which are crucial for energy production. Research has also shown that some Lactobacillus strains help to produce vitamin K which is important for producing prothrombin a protein that plays a crucial role in blood clotting and heart health. Vitamin K also assists with energy production within the mitochondria. Yes! Although the exact mechanisms of probiotics are not fully understood there are several ways in which probiotics are thought to help prevent and alleviate constipation. it’s important to know that intestinal bacteria not only affect the motility of the gut but are also involved in the function of the enteric nervous system (ENS). A slow bowel transit time often occurs due to poor gut motility particularly in the large intestine which is also linked to abnormalities of the enteric nerves. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) can also help with constipation. Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli assist in the production of SCFAs by fermenting carbohydrates in the gut. These SCFAs can improve the motility of the digestive tract by stimulating neural receptors in the gut wall smooth muscle stimulating peristalsis. Probiotics have also been suggested to increase levels of serotonin an excitatory neurotransmitter that also improves peristalsis. Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli also help to increase the breakdown of bile salts in the gut which are important for fat digestion Research published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition shows that Bifidobacteria were especially effective in increasing the number of weekly bowel movements and helping to soften stools which makes them easier to pass. Other research suggests that using a supplement containing multiple strains of probiotics is also effective in treating constipation. Although there is no such thing as a “magic pill” that makes you it’s now well-established that gut health plays a major role in healthy weight management. Scientists now know that the composition of your gut microbiota can influence the way your body breaks down carbohydrates in your food as well as how it uses and stores energy. Moreover slim people tend to have different species of bacteria in their gut compared to people who are overweight or obese. Research has also shown that when obese people lose weight the diversity of their gut microbiome changes and becomes more like that of slim people. These findings have led scientists to believe that gut bacteria not only affect the way you store fat but also the balance of glucose in your blood and how you respond to hormones that make you feel hungry or satisfied. An imbalance of these microbes can help set the stage for obesity and diabetes throughout life. Two specific strains have been linked to lower body weight: Akkermansia muciniphila and Christensenella minuta. These strains are often present in slimmer people. It’s believed that these microbes also produce acetate a short-chain fatty acid that helps regulate body fat stores and appetite. Studies in mice have shown that higher levels of the Akkermansia muciniphila species are associated with lower body weight and that it may also reverse fat mass gain and reduce adipose tissue inflammation. the composition of your gut flora is crucial to the production of intestinal gas. An imbalance of good and bad bacteria in the gut can lead to a range of unpleasant symptoms such as constipation and bloating. That can seriously impact the way that you live your life. Some beneficial bacterial strains such as Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridia are known for their gas-producing properties. Fortunately The microbiota in your colon is required to ferment food that you cannot fully digest and isn’t absorbed by the gut. This is why the amount of fiber you eat and the composition of your gut microbiota have a lot to do with how much gas you produce each day as well as how often you go to the bathroom. Specific strains of probiotics such as Bifidobacterium lactis and Lactobacillus acidophilus have been shown to reduce the gas produced in the intestines. It’s also been found that taking a multi-strain probiotic supplement can help to keep excessive gas at bay. Yes! Bloating occurs when gas builds up in your gut creating a feeling of fullness. This can be quite uncomfortable bloating symptoms can be linked to a specific food you have eaten—particularly onions some people may find they bloat up after every meal which suggests all is not well in their gut. Probiotics can help to restore the balance of bacteria in the gut by supplying the “friendly” bacteria that counteract the bad. These bacteria modify the composition of gut flora which may help to reduce the production of intestinal gas. One particular strain associated with reducing gas and bloating is LGG which proved to be more effective than placebo in reducing the severity of IBS symptoms. Another study showed that patients treated with L. Plantarum experienced significant reductions in their flatulence compared with a placebo group. Remember that your diet is probably a cause of your bloating too. For example it might be worth reducing the carbs in your diet in addition to taking probiotics. Yes! Probiotics help to restore the balance of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ bacteria in the gut which often leads to the development of a yeast infection. These infections occur when yeasts grow out of control and spread throughout the intestines. However probiotics may help to “crowd out” these harmful strains and restore the natural balance of your gut flora. Saccharomyces boulardii is a yeast—but a beneficial one. In fact it has the power to fight Candida by inhibiting its ability to establish itself in the gut. It’s also been shown that S. boulardii may help to reduce the likelihood of Candida yeasts ending up in the digestive tract. This may be because S. boulardii produces caprylic acid an antifungal substance with powerful anti-Candida properties. Don’t discount the possibility that your diet may be leading to those yeast infections. A low-sugar diet like the Candida diet can help to suppress intestinal yeast overgrowth and reduce the number of yeast infections that you experience. Lactobacillus acidophilus is one of the most-researched strains and has also been shown to promote the production of antibodies that fight C. Albicans. Most importantly L. acidophilus can inhibit Candida albicans from forming a biofilm which is the protective sticky covering that protects the yeast from other treatments. The health benefits of probiotics are undeniable and they can be found in many supplements and foods. Their significant health benefits and accessibility make them an ideal part of your regular diet. and choose one that you think best suits you.

Am I still alive?” “Those aren’t the questions you should be asking.” (Care of At the heart of “Rick and Morty” is a Will you crumple in despair knowing the terrifying truth that or will you saddle up the universe and strike out for a life of fun and adventure? root of all great stories throughout all time. If you’re a fan of the brilliant maestro of myth Joseph Campbell you know the question as “the call to adventure” which comes from his classic masterpiece “ The Hero with a Thousand Faces “I refuse to answer a literal call to adventure Morty. Let it go to voicemail.” — Shittiest episode of all time “Vindicators 3” Devotes of “The Matrix” will know it as the “red pill/blue pill” question. the story ends. You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.” And it’s not just a single question. It’s the distillation of hundreds of interrelated and interdependent existential questions: What am I supposed to do? It’s something every single one of us must face at some point in our lives if not multiple times. It usually comes out of nowhere when we’re at our lowest and most vulnerable when our house is burning and we’ve lost everything. Or sometimes it just hits us when we’re drunk. Watch the question strike Rick and Morty co-creator in the middle of a recording session: what happens when we die? What happens when we all die? You guys worry about that shit at night?” Nobody is safe from the existential crisis. check out my terrifying true form. the most powerful warrior in the world faces a horrifying civil war. On the eve of the war’s first battle Arjuna looks across the field and when he sees his friends and family arrayed against him he throws down his bow crumples to his knees and refuses to fight. The rest of the story is about why Arjuna picks the bow back up But it’s not just great warriors and heroes who face the crisis. It mows down the great and the small alike. Watch as it hits Rick’s daughter Beth right after her marriage fails. Everything she believed seems totally wrong and pointless. She doesn’t know who she is or what she’s supposed to do next so she asks her father the demi-God of the “Rick and Morty” universe I’m out of excuses to not be who I am so who am I? What do I do?” Rick suggests she get out there and do something. Saddle up and take the universe for a ride. That’s what most of us do. When we’re offered an adventure we say no fucking way. Just like Beth we mumble excuses about family work and “as much as I hate to admit it ABC’s ‘The Bachelor’” and go right back to pretending everything is fine. accept whatever “meaning” is passed down to us from our family religion and work. We choke it down and go right back to worrying about whatever trivial distraction has us tangled up at the moment like this famous skit from Monty Python’s “ Notice how the movie manages to slip in one of the great answers to the question of the meaning of life and everyone immediately ignores it. they can’t hear the answer at all and so they go back to worrying about the mundane. That’s because we’re literally wired to believe delusions. We hear the truth and it comes across our mental feed like white noise. “What was that about hats again?” But some of us can’t let the question go. This is particularly true of artists great leaders and Rick-level super-geniuses. Maybe the only people who don’t bother with self-exploration are the lowest form of human politicians and TV talking heads. But why? Where does it all lead? What’s the point of even asking? There is none. It’s just that some of us can’t not do it. When someone asked George Mallory why he climbed Mount Everest he quipped: So just for fun let’s take the red pill for once. Let’s see how deep the rabbit hole goes. It can’t be that bad right? We’ll take a quick tour of the universal mysteries of life and forget all about it in the morning OK? We’ll check out the world through Rick’s eyes and see what he sees. Let’s go. In and out. 20 minute adventure. if you have a flask of whiskey in your back pocket you might want to pour yourself a few shots so you can pretend you never read the next section Or you can stop reading now and go back to watching ABC’s “The Bachelor”. And if you do stick around and somehow make it through the next section because there’s hope on the other side. We’ll take a look at why Arjuna got back up. But first we have to see why he falls. Why Arjuna Fell and Why Rick Drinks so Much What’s the worst that could happen if we go mucking around in spiritual no-man’s land and probing the limits of reality? Nothing much. Just total nervous break down death and dismemberment and an inability to go outside ever again or enjoy anything you loved in the past. No scene captures the existential dilemma and its awful answers better than this scene with the little butter robot who realizes he’s only alive to serve one stupid purpose. He is not destined for great things or changing the world. He is just — ordinary a bitter pill to swallow like learning you’re an extra in a B movie forever. “What is my purpose?” asks the little robot to his God his shoulders falling in defeat. Turns out the truth is a long strange trip into the nightmare that lays at the dark heart of reality. This microscope and article reveals things beyond comprehension. AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Perhaps no book ever written captures the absolute meltdown that comes from digging too deep into the mysteries of life better than the Enlightenment trilogy by Jed McKenna starting with the first book It’s not a fun book to read and I don’t recommend you read it unless you really can’t stop yourself from doing the stupidest thing possible and poking around the limits of your reality cage. Do you like swimming with giant electric eels? Good. It’s just like that. There’s only one reason to start seeking answers to the ultimate questions of life. Because you have to and that’s it. That’s why Rick did it and that’s why “ Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland did it. How do I know they did it? Because someone who’s been through the mental minefield recognizes everyone else who has too. The signs of it saturate their work and nobody bothers to write about the existential journey unless they went through the darkness and found the portal on the other side. There’s a portal on the other side? But first we go through the black hole to get there. So let’s do it. at least not when they actually find it. You’re more likely to be a victim of enlightenment than the beneficiary since enlightenment is not what we’re sold (beatific smile blah blah) but rather it means “ figuring it all out and shedding all illusions and bullshit beliefs for good. Except the experience of reading McKenna’s books is more like falling out of an airplane with no parachute. It’s also a bit like this scene where Jerry tries to fold himself twelve times. Truth is a fucking hard bitch. One of the first things you discover in the journey of self is that the Universe can be a fucked up Like this quote from the Gita that Jed highlights in the very first chapter: the ultimate waster of people ready for the hour that ripens to their doom. The warriors arrayed in hostile armies facing each other whether you strike or stay your hand.” If you really stop to think about it that is a completely fucked up passage. Basically God is telling Arjuna to get up and kill those motherfuckers because they’re already dead in the future. Yeah. Best not to think about it. “What about the reality where Hitler cured Cancer? The answer is don’t think about it.” You may recognize the first line in the Gita as the one Oppenheimer quoted after seeing the first atomic bomb explode: illusions and everything you care about. Yeah! And that’s exactly what spiritual exploration is like: Dancing with nukes. The stakes cannot be higher and it’s easy to blow yourself up along with everything you ever loved or believed. The search for ultimate meaning is not about meditation and doing nothing and staying right where you were all along. exploring everything and going through profound and painful self-exploration where you strip away what’s not real layer by layer Autolysis is a fun word. It means “self-digestion” and it’s the process by which a cell destroys itself through its own enzymes. The next thing you figure out in the great Campbellian Hero with a Thousand Faces journey is that you’re going to die just like Morty does in epic fashion after burying his alternate universe self. Nobody exists on purpose. Nobody belongs anywhere. Everybody is going to die. Come watch TV ” says Morty to his sister when she wants to run away after a petty fight with her mother. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. That’s what happened to my friend who was working a highly paid job at a major tech company when her friend passed away. In my interview with her in 2013 before she become a famous globe trotting scuba diver and world renowned photographer she had this to say about it: “A big part of why I [took off exploring the world] was because a friend had passed away hours before his 28th birthday. It was my first experience with knowing someone close that had died. This really woke me up. “Wow we really die! I will never see David again… Ever!” I thought about that ALL THE TIME. you can go at any moment and what will your life have been like?” Here’s Morty’s reaction after he buries himself. the whole wonderful scene here to remind you of your own death too Marcus Aurelius and his Stoic Philosophy Buddha and his quest for ultimate meaning to diabolical super-scientist Rick Sanchez ends up tearing reality apart (in Rick’s case literally) looking for the ultimate meaning in the face of death. If we’re going to die then surely there’s some grander purpose behind it all? I mean we have whole industries dedicated to providing answers to these big questions. They most know something Turns out those institutions are just there to put you right back to sleep. They specialize in platitudes and spiritual Ambien. Oh you’re worried it’s all a pointless dream? Take three of these and call me in the morning. We believe we want to wake up. But the real truth is we’ll give anything to go back to sleep to return to the dream that is our life. the ready made answers never satisfy the artist Still with me? Want to know what they find? This is going to be such a mind fuck! The Wormhole at the Center of You What they find is some major or minor variation on the following: I recommend reading the following really like an announcer from the disclaimer section of a drug commercial: At the root of everything is a black hole of nothingness. Eventually you won’t exist and despite millions of years of comforting beliefs there’s probably nothing after the grave meaning we’re just gone as if we never existed. We have as much substance as dream dust. consciousness is the only thing that actually exists. If you probe the nature of what you can actually know the only thing you can come up with is “I am” aka solipsism the third rail of philosophy. Beyond that everything gets very from there we can kind of sort of figure out the rest of this crazy ass shit I’m about to drop on you if we stretch ourselves and just say fuck it let’s run with this whole bullshit premise for now and see where it leads. New catch phrase is “I don’t give a fuck.” if consciousness is all that exists beyond nothing it’s really a singular consciousness meaning we’re all the same stuff underneath looking out on the universe with a trillion set of eyes aka God/the Universe is a solipsist and/or an atheistic clockwork machine. That essentially means that perception/perceived and perceiver are the same thing. The “logical” implications of that are absolutely horrifying. It’s a bit like a bad conspiracy horror novel. As horror master and existential philosopher Thomas Ligotti points out in his book “ The Conspiracy Against the Human Race we’re not aware of our basic interconnectedness so we spend eternity in a pointless “festival of massacres” maiming and torturing other versions of ourselves because we can’t see we’re all the same stuff ignorance is built into the very fabric of the system and we are quite literally insane because we are blind to our true nature. No wonder the agoraphobic Liggotti doesn’t leave his house anymore and Rick drinks. Morty. It’s a terrifying universe. since everything around you appears to be separate but is actually not everything you see and feel is a grand like a dream (as the s/Buddhists call reality) or a simulation (like the tech nerds call it aka the Singularity but it already happened) which is really saying the same thing using the language available at the time. you imagine you’re a separate entity with free will in a physical universe and yet there’s really no evidence either way that you are or not. going a little further we find that the singular consciousness underneath it all is really perfect which means that it creates/codes/dreams a perfect universe an amoeba or animal like universe and/or a multiverse where everything that can happen does happen (another theme of the show — the multiverse). Perfection is very comforting until you keep digging and realize imperfection is freaking everywhere from random killings to genocide and inequality which begs the question is it really perfect aka the “if God is good then why does Hitler exist?” question. The answer is yes it is perfect which means that the Universe does not have our morality at all. It has its own fucked up morality because it allows evil to exist. In biological reality death is bad and life is good. Hunger is bad and eating is good. But once you step outside of biological reality morality ceases to exist and that’s where God/the Universe/quantum physics’ morality lives. Uh oh. that doesn’t give a fuck about you and me kind of like when the giant heads show up in Season Two. in the words of Dan Harmon Because it kills people and puppies the good and the bad the innocent and the guilty with total abandon and keeps making more of us to slaughter. It blows up stars and entire planets for fun killing everything on them with no remorse whatsoever. “God” is essentially really fucked up computer code. Does the computer code care about the non-player characters that the kid playing the game gleefully mows down? Nope. When the river drowns everyone under it it’s just part of the plan. And it also means you have to rectify both imperfection and perfection existing at the same time. How is that freaking possible? How is the Universe/everything/God/reality perfect but imperfect at the same time? Something perfect cannot be imperfect by its very nature (aka “God can’t make a stone he/she/it can’t lift”) which means that the only way for that universal consciousness to experience “imperfection” is to create endless copies of itself like fracturing itself into a bazillion pieces in order to feel what it’s like to not know everything and to not be able to lift that stone bypassing the paradox all together. it made you and me and infinite versions of you and me just so it could be ignorant and limited. if every fractured version of the universal consciousness all woke up at the same time and realized it was all nonsense/a dream/a drama/a game the whole merry go round stops and that can’t be permitted. So the Universe actively keeps the vast majority of people in the dark numbing them out with addictions/religion/TV/the Internet/every day thoughts/distractions/trivia/dramas/drugs/alcohol/war and by putting a sheen of absolutely impenetrable ignorance and willful blindness over the minds of everyone in the world aka Maya. Maya rules unopposed over 99.99999999% of us so that the powerful play goes on and we can all play our part over and over and over again in the festival. You may be feeling like the girl in this little clip: What the fuck is going on? I skipped a lot of the math here so don’t feel bad if you’re confused or think I missed something and/or I’m crazy/stupid/both/talking out of my ass. I am. These are just words. Don’t worry about them at all. They don’t mean anything. You don’t have to believe any of it. Just take a deep breath. You’re free to disagree with any or all of it. so please don’t make that mistake and get mad at me for saying it. I’m just summarizing. OK? All good? Great. the comments are going to be fucked up on this one aren’t they? So let me just say this: Everything I said is wrong. Don’t believe any of it. There is nothing to believe. Just having fun here. It’s a simple thought experiment. Nothing to be afraid of and nothing to worry about at all. It was all just a dream. believe whatever you want (which is what you are wired to do anyway). the story ends. You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.” the average workaday geniuses of history tend to come to some variation of the above philosophy and so does our boy Rick Sanchez. Here’s Rick’s summary of the above in succinct rapid-fire brilliance after Beth asks him whether she’s evil? the Universe is yours and I’ve never met a Universe that was into it. The Universe is basically an animal. It grazes on the ordinary. It creates infinite idiots just to eat them …You know smart people get a chance to climb on top take reality for a ride it will never stop trying to throw you . There’s no other way off.” Essentially it means that even when you can understand the fundamental nature of reality you’re still subject to it. The Universe will feast on you too. The only way out is through. Through the Wormhole and Why Arjuna Got His Groove Back Still here? Awesome. Now comes the good part. But first take a deep breath. We’re cool Did you have that drink? Good. Have another. right? Am I right or am I right? But the story doesn’t end there. We’re through the wormhole and there is something on the other side. “Before enlightenment there is the mountain. During enlightenment there is no mountain. After enlightenment there is the mountain again.” What the fuck does that mean? It means that while you’re in the worm hole everything is relative and nothing really exists. It’s all an illusion. And then you get over it. You took a big trip but you didn’t get anywhere. You wake up again and you’re right back in the dream/video game/simulation/reality. You’re still playing. There’s no way out. Now we have figure out what the fuck to do with all that horrifying knowledge. the answer goes right to the very essence of the show. How the fuck do you keep going once you know all that? Krishna’s answer to Arjuna was pretty simple. The story happens with or without you so pick up your sword and fight! so take up your role in the play gladly and lead the battle. Oh and you can’t really escape since we are all here for eternity. But not all of us are warriors. Some of us are just regular every day folk. So how the hell do the great stories apply to us? What do we do? Is there any hope? There are only three true answers to the ultimate absurdity of life. The first is never leave your house again. just kidding. Don’t do that. Please don’t do that. There’s a whole (imaginary) world out here The second answer is to develop a fantastic sense of humor. If you watch “Rick and Morty” you’ve already got that box checked. The third answer is what the show is all about: Get the fuck out there and have an amazing adventure! Life is a blank canvas. Paint whatever you want. Live the life of your dreams. Saddle up the universe and get out there and enjoy it in all its multi-resplendent glory. That is the paradox of meaninglessness. It can mean whatever the hell you want it to mean. The skyscraper exists for no reason. So does the ant. But as soon as the ant decides to climb that skyscraper they both have a purpose that’s instantly created through their intersection point. The ant wants to climb and so it now has meaning and the skyscraper is there so the ant can climb it so it has meaning too. All meaning comes from your decisions. You must make a choice. And then your purpose is set to iron rails. Meaning does not exist but it springs into reality when you make your choice. (See the “Monty Python” sketch for further explanation.) the real answer is even simpler. The problem is that you were asking the wrong question. What is the meaning of life is For Rick it’s finding Mulan’s Szechuan sauce. “What the hell are you talking about You should probably pick a better reason than Rick for sticking around the cosmic fun house. Everyone finds the answer for themselves. That’s the only way. And that’s exactly the answer Dan Harmon gives in this brilliant little four minute video called “ ” that explores everything we went through here in all its terrifying glory: I can’t say it any better actually so I’ll just quote the master story teller and genius himself because it’s worth repeating: “Do I agree with Rick that nothing means anything? No I do not because the knowledge that nothing matters The planet is dying. The sun is exploding. The universe is cooling. Nothing is going to matter. The further back you pull the more that truth will endure. But when you zoom in on Earth when you zoom in a family when you zoom into a human brain and a childhood and human experience you see all these things that matter. We have this fleeting chance to participate in an illusion called I love my girlfriend and I love my dog. How is that not better?” How is that not better indeed? So you live in an illusion. So what? Who cares? And get a pet. Pets are awesome. Just don’t give them the “gift” of intelligence so they have to figure out all this heavy shit or you might end up in a shitty parody of “Lawnmower Man.” The only sane response is humor and to get out there and have fun. Actually Harmon is much smarter than me or I would have created “Rick and Morty” myself so I’ll let him have the last word and deliver to you with this little glowing green gem: can actually save you in those moments. Once you get through the terrifying threshold of accepting that then every place is the center of the universe and every moment is most important moment and everything is the meaning of life If you read this whole damn thing because nothing really matters and so you might as well give me five bucks so I can live the life of my dreams. read by a real voice actor on Mastering Depression and Living the Life You Were Meant to Live tells the story of how I battle depression and still live a big bold and beautiful life that I’m proud of every day. where we discuss all things tech fantasy and the absurdity of life By the way the answer to the meaning of life is and always was “42.” public speaker and pro blogger.

Operators are special symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation. The value that the operator operates on is called the operand. is the operator that performs addition. is the output of the operation. Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition Add two operands or unary plus Subtract right operand from the left or unary minus Divide left operand by the right one (always results into float) Modulus - remainder of the division of left operand by the right x % y (remainder of x/y) Floor division - division that results into whole number adjusted to the left in the number line Exponent - left operand raised to the power of right x**y (x to the power y) Example 1: Arithmetic operators in Python x = 15
y = 4

# Output: x + y = 19
print('x + y =' x+y)

# Output: x - y = 11
print('x - y =' x-y)

# Output: x * y = 60
print('x * y =' x*y)

# Output: x / y = 3.75
print('x / y =' x/y)

# Output: x // y = 3
print('x // y =' x//y)

# Output: x ** y = 50625
print('x ** y =' x + y = 19
x - y = 11
x * y = 60
x / y = 3.75
x // y = 3
x ** y = 50625 Comparison operators are used to compare values. It returns either Greater than - True if left operand is greater than the right Less than - True if left operand is less than the right Equal to - True if both operands are equal Not equal to - True if operands are not equal Greater than or equal to - True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right Less than or equal to - True if left operand is less than or equal to the right Example 2: Comparison operators in Python x = 10
y = 12

# Output: x > y is False
print('x > y is' x>y)

# Output: x < y is True
print('x < y is' x<y)

# Output: x == y is False
print('x == y is' x==y)

# Output: x != y is True
print('x != y is' x!=y)

# Output: x >= y is False
print('x >= y is' x>=y)

# Output: x <= y is True
print('x <= y is' x > y is False
x < y is True
x == y is False
x != y is True
x >= y is False
x <= y is True True if both the operands are true True if either of the operands is true True if operand is false (complements the operand) Example 3: Logical Operators in Python x = True
y = False

print('x and y is' x and y)

print('x or y is' x and y is False
x or y is True
not x is False Bitwise operators act on operands as if they were strings of binary digits. They operate bit by bit x & y = 0 ( x | y = 14 ( x ^ y = 14 ( x >> 2 = 2 ( x << 2 = 40 ( Assignment operators are used in Python to assign values to variables. is a simple assignment operator that assigns the value 5 on the right to the variable There are various compound operators in Python like that adds to the variable and later assigns the same. It is equivalent to Python language offers some special types of operators like the identity operator or the membership operator. They are described below with examples. are the identity operators in Python. They are used to check if two values (or variables) are located on the same part of the memory. Two variables that are equal does not imply that they are identical. True if the operands are identical (refer to the same object) True if the operands are not identical (do not refer to the same object) Example 4: Identity operators in Python x1 = 5
y1 = 5
x2 = 'Hello'
y2 = 'Hello'
x3 = [1 3]

# Output: False
print(x1 is not y1)

# Output: True
print(x2 is y2)

# Output: False
print(x3 is y3) are integers of the same values so they are equal as well as identical. Same is the case with are lists. They are equal but not identical. It is because the interpreter locates them separately in memory although they are equal. are the membership operators in Python. They are used to test whether a value or variable is found in a sequence ( In a dictionary we can only test for presence of key True if value/variable is found in the sequence True if value/variable is not found in the sequence Example #5: Membership operators in Python x = 'Hello world'
y = {1:'a' 2:'b'}

# Output: True
print('H' in x)

# Output: True
print('hello' not in x)

# Output: True
print(1 in y)

# Output: False
print('a' in y) Python is case sensitive). Similarly Precedence and Associativity of Operators in Python Join our newsletter for the latest updates. Join our newsletter for the latest updates. Java

1620762306.727359,83065091,https://hackaday.com/author/moritzsivers/,You might think that particle physicists would be sad when an experiment comes up with different results than their theory would predict but nothing brightens up a field like unexplained phenomena.  Indeed particle physicists have been feverishly looking for deviations from the Standard Model. This year there have been tantalizing signs that a long unresolved discrepancy between theory and experiment will be confirmed by new experimental results. the quest to measure the magnetic moment of muons started more than 60 years ago and this has been measured ever more precisely since. From an experiment in 1959 at CERN in Switzerland to the turn of the century at Brookhaven to this year’s result at Fermilab the magnetic moment of the muon seems to be at odds with theoretical predictions. Although a statistical fluke is basically excluded this value also relies on complex theoretical calculations that are not all in agreement. Instead of heralding a new era of physics it might just be another headline too good to be true. But some physicists are mumbling “new particle” in hushed tones. Let’s see what all the fuss is about. How Fast Is The Universe Expanding? The Riddle Of Two Values For The Hubble Constant our understanding of the Universe has made tremendous progress. Not long ago “precision astronomy” was thought to be an oxymoron. Nowadays satellite experiments and powerful telescopes on earth were able to measure the properties of our Universe with astonishing precision. For example we know the age of the Universe with an uncertainty of merely 0.3% and even though we still do not know the origin of Dark Matter or Dark Energy we have determined their abundance with a precision of better than 1%. one value that astronomers have difficulty in pinning down: how fast our universe is expanding. Or astronomers have used multiple methods of estimating the Hubble constant and the different methods are converging quite tightly on two different values! This clearly can’t be true but nobody has yet figured out how to reconcile the results and further observations have only improved the precision deepening the conflict. It’s likely that we’ll need either new astronomy or new physics to solve this puzzle. The Discovery of the Expanding Universe In the 1920s Edwin Hubble used the newly built telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory to study fuzzy objects known as nebulae. Back then astronomers were arguing whether these nebulae are clouds of stars within our Milky Way or if they are whole different galaxies. Hubble discovered stars within these nebulae whose brightness slowly fades in and out. These were known as Cepheids and previously studied by Henrietta Levitt who showed that there was a tight relationship between the star’s intrinsic brightness and the period of its variation. This means Cepheids could be used as so-called standard candles which refers to objects whose absolute brightness is known. Since there is a simple relationship between how the brightness of an object decreases with distance Hubble was able to calculate the distance of the Cepheids by comparing their apparent and intrinsic brightness. He showed that the Cepheid stars were not located within our galaxy and that nebulae are actually distant galaxies. Hubble also measured the velocity at which these distant galaxies are moving away from us by observing the redshifts of spectral lines caused by the Doppler effect. He found that the further away the galaxy is located the faster it is moving away from us described by a simple linear relationship. is what is known as the Hubble constant. Later the Belgian priest and physicist Georges Lemaître realized that the velocity-distance relationship measured by Hubble was evidence for the expansion of the Universe. Since the expansion of space itself causes other galaxies to move away from us we are not in any privileged location but the same effect would be measured from any other place in the Universe. An effect that is sometimes illustrated by drawing points on a balloon when it is inflated the points move away from each other at a speed that depends on their distance. It is also better not to think of the cosmological redshift as being caused by a real velocity as the parameter in the above equation can easily exceed the speed of light. “How Fast Is The Universe Expanding? The Riddle Of Two Values For The Hubble Constant” A Brief History Of Optical Communication We live in the information age where access to the internet is considered a fundamental human right. Exercising this right does largely rely on the technological advances made in optical communication. Using light to send information has a long history: from ancient Greece through Claude Chappe’s semaphore towers and Alexander Graham Bell’s photophone to fiber optic networks and future satellite internet constellations currently developed by tech giants. Let’s dive a little bit deeper into the technologies that were used to spread information with the help of light throughout history. “A Brief History Of Optical Communication” 4-bit Retrocomputer Emulator Gets Custom PCB It might be fair to suspect that most people who are considered digital natives have very little to no clue about what is actually going on inside their smartphones and computers. To be fair it is not easy to understand how modern CPUs work but this was different at the beginning of the 80s when personal computers just started to become popular. People who grew up back then might have a much better understanding of computer basics thanks to computer education systems. The Busch 2090 Microtronic Computer System released in 1981 in Germany was one of these devices teaching people the basics of programming and machine language. It was also [Michael Wessel]’s first computer and even though he is still in proud possession of the original he just recently The original Microtronic was sold under the catchy slogan “Hobby of the future which has already begun!” Of course the specs of the 4-bit 500 kHz TMS 1600 inside the Microtronic seem laughable compared to modern microcontrollers but it did run a virtual environment that taught more than the native assembly. He points out though that the instruction manual was exceptionally well written and is still highly effective in teaching students the basics of computer programming. a couple of years back he wrote an he got around to extending the functionality and creating a custom PCB for the device. The whole thing is based on ATMega 2560 Pro Mini including an SD card module for file storage and a whole bunch of pushbuttons. He also added an RTC module and a speaker to recreate some of the original functions like programming a digital clock or composing melodies. The device can also serve as an emulator of the cassette interface of the original Microtronic that allowed to save programs with a whopping data rate of 14 baud. He has certainly done a great job of preserving this beautiful piece of retro-tech for the future. Instead of an Arduino retro computers can also be or just take the original hardware and extend it with a Raspberry Pi Space Is Radioactive: Dealing With Cosmic Rays Outer space is not exactly a friendly environment which is why we go through great lengths before we boost people up there. Once you get a few hundred kilometers away from our beloved rocky planet things get uncomfortable due to the lack of oxygen and high doses of radiation. Especially the latter poses a great challenge for long-term space travel and so people are working on various concepts to protect astronauts’ DNA from being smashed by cosmic rays. This has become ever more salient as NASA contemplates future manned missions to the Moon and Mars. So let’s learn more about the dangers posed by galactic cosmic rays and solar flares. “Space Is Radioactive: Dealing With Cosmic Rays” Prism Lighting – The Art Of Steering Daylight The incandescent light bulb was one of the first early applications of electricity and it’s hard to underestimate its importance. But before the electric light people didn’t live in darkness — they thought of ways to redirect sunlight to brighten up interior spaces. This was made possible through the understanding of the basic principles of optics and the work of skilled glassmakers who constructed prism tiles and vault lights. These century-old techniques are still being applied today for the diffusion of LEDs or for increasing the brightness of LCD displays. People in optics are a bit sloppy when it comes to the definition of a prism. While many of them are certainly not geometric prisms Wikipedia defines it as a transparent optical element with flat polished surfaces of which at least one is angled. As can be seen in the pictures below some of the prisms here do not even stick to this definition. Browsing the catalog of your favorite optics supplier you will find a and collimate light. It is important to point out that we are not so much interested in dispersive prisms that split a beam of white light into its spectrum of colors . The important property of prisms in this article is their ability to redirect light through refraction and reflection. A Safe Way to Bring Light Under Deck A collection of deck lights used to direct sunlight below deck in ships. Credit: One of the most important uses of prism lighting was on board ships. Open flames could have disastrous consequences aboard a wooden ship so deck prisms were installed as a means to direct sunlight into the areas below decks. One of the first patents for deck lights “THE GREAT AND DURABLE INCREASE OF LIGHT BY EXTRAORDINARY GLASSES AND LAMPS” was filed by Edward Wyndus as early as 1684. Deck prisms had typical sizes of 10 to 15 centimeters. The flat top was installed flush with the deck and the sunlight was refracted and directed downward from the prism point. Because of the reversibility of light paths (“If I can see you you can see me”) deck prisms also helped to spot fires under deck. “Prism Lighting – The Art Of Steering Daylight” Getting Rid Of All The Space Junk In Earth’s Backyard since the first satellite launch in 1957 mankind began to populate the Earth orbit with all kinds of spacecraft. On the downside space also became more and more cluttered with trash from defunct or broken up rocket stages and satellites. Moving at speeds of nearly 30 even the tiniest object can pierce a hole through your spacecraft. Therefore space junk poses a real threat for both manned and unmanned spacecraft and that is why space agencies are increasing their efforts into tracking and getting rid of it. “Getting Rid Of All The Space Junk In Earth’s Backyard” The Russian Woodpecker: Official Bird Of The Cold War Nests In Giant Antenna And What It Can Do For You How To Build A Turbo Car The Cheap SpaceX Drops The Ball On Catching Fairings South Australia Vs.

These problems are typically exponential in terms of time complexity and may require exploring all possible permutations in worst case. The Branch and Bound Algorithm technique solves these problems relatively quickly. There are many algorithms by which the knapsack problem can be solved: Let’s see the Branch and Bound Approach to solve the : The Backtracking Solution can be optimized if we know a bound on best possible solution subtree rooted with every node. If the best in subtree is worse than current best we can simply ignore this node and its subtrees. So we compute bound (best solution) for every node and compare the bound with current best solution before exploring the node. Example bounds used in below diagram are A down can give $315 D down can $125 and E down can $30.

Here are some things you should look out for to help spot fake people. Most of these people are actually not that good in real life. But they act like they are and ensure that they appear better than the next person. The issue for you is that you may find yourself always feeling “beneath” them and irritated at their constant need to be in the spotlight. 2. Murky in Expressing Their Emotions It’s much harder to say “I’m the best at what I do” while simultaneously sharing “average” emotions with “equal” people. and learn from our mistakes. But to do that we have to be able to adopt a level of genuineness and depth that fake people don’t routinely have. A fake person generally never apologizes it is often followed with a “but” in the next breath. A lot of fake people hide pain and other underlying reasons in their behavior. This could explain why they can’t be authentic and/or have difficulties seeing their environment for the way it objectively is (both good and bad). this is a problem for two reasons. Firstly these people are simply saying yes to things for their own satisfaction. Secondly they often end up changing their minds or retracting their offer for one reason or another (“I would have loved to but my grandmother suddenly fell ill.”) leaving you in the lurch for the 100th time this year. It’s not unusual to hear that a fake person talks constantly behind people’s backs. Let’s be honest if they do it to others they’re doing it to you too.

Be Upfront and Honest About How You Feel don’t confuse asking for advice with gossiping behind the fake person’s back because you don’t want to stoop down to their level. However a little reminder as to how to stay on your own wellness track can never hurt. Have they suffered recent trauma? Have they been rejected all their lives? Is their so low that they must resort to making themselves feel good in any way they can? Sometimes having an understanding of a person’s behavior can help in processing it. Self-care can be as simple as taking a hot shower after talking to them or declining an invitation when you’re not feeling up to the challenge. Spotting fake people isn’t too hard. They generally glow with wanna-be vibes. However there are reasons as to why they are like this. Calling their behavior might be the first step. Providing them with support might be the second. But if these don’t work it’s time to stay away and surround yourself with the positivity that you deserve.

Expressing our differences in opinion allows us to have healthy conflict and many times come to an agreement or understanding that works for everyone. However there are times when anger can become overwhelming or damaging it’s important to learn how to deal with anger. Expressing anger inappropriately can be harmful to relationships both personal and professional. You may express too much anger or at times that are only going to make things worse not better. In this article we will look at anger management techniques that will help you better control your emotions. Let’s take a deeper look at how to deal with anger. happens when someone is angry but uses indirect communication to express their anger. Some of the more common passive-aggressive behaviors include the silent treatment making comments about someone behind their back or simply not doing tasks or assignments that they should. This is a passive-aggressive person’s way of showing their anger. It’s not very productive but extremely common. An example would be getting angry at one person in front of a crowd of people. All that does is make people uncomfortable and shuts them down. It’s not a healthy way to express anger or disagreement with someone. people will start to avoid this person and have as little contact as possible. The reason being is no one likes being around someone who is angry all the time; it’s a no-win situation. to adapt? When learning how to deal with anger here are some healthy ways to get you started. Don’t say you’re mad at something someone did or said when it’s really something else that upset you. Don’t talk around something that is making you angry. Don’t say that one thing is making you angry when it’s really something else and don’t stack items on top of each other so you can unload on someone about 10 different things 6 months from now. Be direct and upfront about what is making you angry. Ensure you are expressing your anger to the person who upset you or you are angry at not to someone else. This is very counterproductive. Think of the marriages that seem to go up in flames out of nowhere when the reality is someone kept quiet for years until they hit their breaking point. Expressing anger as it occurs is a much healthier way of using anger to help us guide our relationships in the moment. I have been known to fire off a quick response and that typically has ended about as well as you might imagine. When I actually walk away from my computer and go do something else for a while I am able to calm down and think more rationally. After that happens I am able to respond in a more appropriate and productive manner. Doing things that helps you learn how to release anger can make an uncomfortable situation more manageable before it gets out of hand. When you are accusatory towards someone all that does is increase the tension. This doesn’t usually do anything except make your anger rise higher. Being able to hit the gym to get a hard workout in is great. If this isn’t an option see if you can go for a run or a bike ride. If you are at work when you become angry and the weather permits at least go outside for a brisk walk. Besides working some of your anger out through exercise this also helps to give your mind a chance to work through some ways to address what it is that upset you. If you’re not sure where to start with an exercise routine There are times when we could all use some help. Life can be stressful and overwhelming. It’s perfectly fine to seek some help from a mental health professional if it will help you get back to a healthy balance.

They can give you some sound advice and ideas on how to get your anger to a more manageable and healthy level. That can mean spending time doing things that help us calm down and relax like being around people we enjoy practicing deep breathing or listening to music. It could be making time for things that help bring us balance like a healthy diet and physical activity. Many people incorporate techniques such as yoga and meditation to calm their minds and release tension when learning how to deal with anger. Whatever your choice is ensure you take time out to relax when warning signs of anger start to bubble up. Incorporating humor and laughter on a regular basis will help keep anger in check and help you get over a bad mood and feelings of anger more quickly. This isn’t part of formal anger management techniques but you’ll be surprised by how well it works. life is a journey that’s meant to be enjoyed fully along the way through healthy emotion. Make sure you take time to laugh and have fun. Surround yourself with people that like to laugh and enjoy life. Don’t work at a job that just causes you stress which can lead to anger. Work at something you enjoy doing Take time out each day to remind yourself of a few things you are grateful for in order to help you learn how to release anger and invite in more positive feelings. . People we are around and situations we are in can cause stress and negative emotions. At times it can seem to be too much and we get angry and our emotions start to get out of control. keep in mind that life is an incredible journey full of wonder and things that bring you joy.

This dynamic nature of name binding makes Python powerful; a name could refer to any type of object. >>> a = 5
>>> a = 'Hello World!'
>>> a = [1 will refer to three different types of objects in different instances. so a name can refer to them as well. def printHello():
    print(""Hello"")


a = printHello

a() can refer to a function and we can call the function using this name. What is a Namespace in Python? Now that we understand what names are we can move on to the concept of namespaces. a namespace is a collection of names. you can imagine a namespace as a mapping of every name you have defined to corresponding objects. Different namespaces can co-exist at a given time but are completely isolated. A namespace containing all the built-in names is created when we start the Python interpreter and exists as long as the interpreter runs. This is the reason that built-in functions like etc. are always available to us from any part of the program. Each These different namespaces are isolated. Hence the same name that may exist in different modules does not collide. Modules can have various functions and classes. A local namespace is created when a function is called which has all the names defined in it. Similar is the case with class. The following diagram may help to clarify this concept. A diagram of different namespaces in Python Although there are various unique namespaces defined we may not be able to access all of them from every part of the program. The concept of scope comes into play. A scope is the portion of a program from where a namespace can be accessed directly without any prefix. there are at least three nested scopes. Scope of the current function which has local names Scope of the module which has global names Outermost scope which has built-in names When a reference is made inside a function the name is searched in the local namespace then in the global namespace and finally in the built-in namespace. If there is a function inside another function a new scope is nested inside the local scope. Example of Scope and Namespace in Python def outer_function():
    b = 20
    def inner_func():
        c = 30

a = 10 is in the global namespace. Variable is in the local namespace of is in the nested local namespace of is global. We can read as well as assign new values to If we try to assign as a value to is created in the local namespace which is different than the nonlocal . The same thing happens when we assign a value to all the reference and assignment go to the global if we want to rebind the variable it must be declared as nonlocal. The following example will further clarify this. def outer_function():
    a = 20

    def inner_function():
        a = 30
        print('a =' a)

    inner_function()
    print('a =' the output of this program is a = 30
a = 20
a = 10 are defined in separate namespaces and accessed accordingly. While in the following program def outer_function():
    global a
    a = 20

    def inner_function():
        global a
        a = 30
        print('a =' a)

    inner_function()
    print('a =' The output of the program is. a = 30
a = 30
a = 30 all references and assignments are to the global due to the use of keyword Join our newsletter for the latest updates. Join our newsletter for the latest updates. Java

1620762372.485668,87323076,https://hackaday.com/2021/05/11/3d-printed-desiccant-container-exploits-infill/,Desiccant is common in 3D printing because the drier plastic filament is the better it prints. Beads of silica gel are great for controlling humidity but finding a porous container for them that is a convenient size is a little harder. 3D printing is a generally useful solution for custom containers but suffers from a slight drawback in this case: printing dense grills or hole patterns is not very efficient for filament-based printers. Dense hole patterns means lots of stopping and starting for the extruder which means a lot of filament retractions and longer print times in general. The green model is used as a modifier to the orange container (of which only the corners are left visible here) [The_Redcoat]’s solution to this is to avoid hole patterns or grills altogether print large wall sections of the container as infill-only with no perimeter layers at all . The exposed infill pattern is dense enough to prevent small beads of desiccant from falling through while allowing ample airflow at the same time. The big advantage here is that infill patterns are also quite efficient for the printer to lay down. Instead of the loads of stops and starts and retractions needed to print a network of holes infill patterns are mostly extruded in layers of unbroken lines. This translates to faster print speeds and an overall more reliable outcome even on printers that might not be as well tuned or calibrated as they could be. to create a stack of segments to use as a modifier in PrusaSlicer. The container is printed as normal except where it intersects with the modifier in which case those areas get printed with infill only and no walls. The result is what you see here: enough airflow for the desiccant to do its job while not allowing any of the beads to escape. It’s a clever use of both a high infill as well as the ability to use a 3D model as a slicing modifier. There’s also another approach to avoiding having to print a dense pattern of holes though it is for light-duty applications only: embedding a material like tulle into a 3D print can make a pretty great fan filter The Russian Woodpecker: Official Bird Of The Cold War Nests In Giant Antenna Neat. Though I find just tipping the beads into the bottom of a vacuum pot and placing stuff on top works well also. May well try a wall free print to see what happens. I just fill a pantyhose leg with them and then yeet it into my air tight storage bin. a nice printing hack to leave out the walls! but i found a much easier solution…i just use ‘formfutura easyfil pla’.  i’m sure most of the other high-end pla is just as good.  the filament that isn’t being used goes in a rubbermaid with a little can of silica but whatever’s on the printer just sits for months in my extremely humid basement and never has any problems.  i only had problems when i was using cheap pla. i’m sure everyone else has reasons for using more temperamental filament or maybe even noticing smaller scale imperfections.  but it was a huge relief for me to find a setup where i don’t have to worry about that sort of thing I understand where you’re coming from but sometimes people want to save a little money especially if they print a ton. Of course there are far simpler solutions than this such as any airtight container with a bag of silica in the center of the reel but it could have its applications. Interesting I may have to try making a flat container like this to place in the bottom of my container.  I always have just used an old tube sock filled with desiccant and tied a knot in the top.  It makes it easy to jam in the voids of the storage container and cotton is pretty heat resistant when drying. and adds a useful tool to the maker’s growing list. I researched filament storage a bit when I got my 3-d printer. (Wanting a tool and not another hobby spending money was more useful than tinkering – your goals may differ.) Air-tight totes are a more expensive than normal totes and you can’t get them locally (probably) but if you’re already using totes they make a good drop-in solution for filament storage. Then a small renewable mini-dehumidifier that has built-in dessicant that changes color when full (of humidity) and can be reformed by plugging it in for a couple of hours. My tote has been full of filament for 6 months now (and counting) with no appreciable color change on the dehumidifier. I got an extra set to use for copper-pipe coils because copper oxidizes from moisture in the air more than just oxygen. Please be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

Do you know how there are saying or words of encouragement that you remember and use all the time? Some came from a loved one and others stick with you from your past and possibly hold you stuck. These are the words of encouragement that come to mind when you need them most to remind you that: you will find the solutions. What you really want in life you can have it. Honestly Look for the quotes that resonate with you and write them somewhere prominent in your life. Look for simple solutions and strategies because they are the ones that have the biggest impact. There is a reason why some of the great ideas from the ancients are still the most used and adaptable to 21st-century living—because they work. Quotes that inspire need to be easy to remember connect with you on a personal level and fire up your passion 50 Quotes and Words of Encouragement for Moving Forward Here are 50 quotes and words of encouragement to keep you inspired and motivated. 2.“For what reasons can it not be you?” 3. Ditch the guilt. Guilt is one emotion that never leads to good things. Remove the guilt and you can move on. 4. At this moment in time you are everything you need to be everything you want to be. 5. The day you realize how amazing you are is the day the world had better stand back. 6. You need to know on a good day how to look after yourself and your success on a bad day. How will you ensure you take action on this advice? 7. Your mind can be a power for your success or power for your failure. Choose wisely the quality of your thoughts. How will you monitor the quality of your thoughts and ensure they work for you? 8. Even the long-distance swimmer does not achieve success on their own—who is in your team toward success? 9. How do you keep going? Look how far you have come. What helped you get this far? Who helped you get this far? How will they feature in the future to ensure you succeed and overcome? 10. Life is easier with love—swap the word “life” for success achieving your goals. Now ask yourself—where do you get your love from? The first place should be you. 12. Learn the science of who you are. This is powerful knowledge that will empower you to move forward no matter what you face or want to achieve. 13. Trying to copy the route to success that someone else took doesn’t guarantee you success. You have to honor your values 14. What you think is possible is absolutely correct. Challenge what you think. ask this question every day and score yourself out of 10 (10 being exceptional 1 being lousy). Write the answer in your phone’s calendar: How successful do I feel? You can swap successful for happy etc. Notice what affects your score. 16. Remember that everything changes. The hibernating tree looks dead but will return in the spring rejuvenated. This is essential knowledge for good times and bad. In bad times it reminds you to keep going it reminds you to be grateful and keep looking to learn and grow. (Just like that tree!) 17. What’s stopping you? Is it a perception or a fact? Either way you can do something about it even if it is just to change the thoughts attached to the thing that is stopping you. Nothing can have power over you unless you let it. 18. Steer clear of negative people and views. It’s all too easy to get dragged into other people’s negativity. Understand how negative news and people impact you. If you can’t find ways to keep that negativity away then step away metaphorically and physically. Your success will appreciate it. 19. The quality of your thoughts and feelings impacts your actions and results. Everything you can see started as a thought. So “are my thoughts enabling me or disabling me?” Are my thoughts “moving me forward or holding me back?” 21. Sad isn’t bad. We get all the emotions not just the good ones. So don’t push those emotions away. Take yourself through this process: For what reason am I feeling this? What does it tell me about my life right now? What does it tell me about my actions and results right now? What would I like to feel instead? What would this do for me? How will I get myself there? Take yourself through the process and own all emotions. 23. The one thing you can control is what you think. your job is not to fit in. Your job is to shine. Stand out. Speak up and be the unique individual you are meant to be. It’s the quickest way to lasting success. 25. Words can only have power if you let them. Good words bad words. Happy words. Successful words. Which words are you giving the most power to? 26. If you want to achieve more you’ve got to assume you are worth it. Are you worth it? (The answer is “Yes with bells on are you worth it!”) And if you don’t believe this then what will you do to rocket your confidence? it is a gift in disguise. It tells you what not to repeat it tells you what didn’t work and it moves you forward to what you want to achieve. Don’t berate and hate your failures. They are driving you forward to your success. 28. It’s hard to achieve great things if you don’t have a plan. It’s like wanting to go on holiday and just rocking up at the airport on the off chance you can get on a plane going to your dream destination. Plan what you want and create a to help get you there. It’s easier and faster. 29. Everyone needs someone in their corner—someone to cheerlead and wipe your grazed knees and remind you that you can. Who is in your corner? You can add me to that list. 30. Social media is supposed to be good for you. It’s supposed to connect you to like-minded people and loved like you are part of something truly special. If it doesn’t step away from the negative groups and look for the things that inspire you—yes you can include cute funny cat videos! 31. Action! The key to success is knowing when to 32. When someone tells you that one book changed their life that doesn’t mean it will work for you. If it doesn’t work for you the book failed. The book was the wrong book for you. Don’t stop reading. Just look for the right fit for you. 33. Just as all people are different with different beliefs and aspirations so is the journey to success and progress different for all. Expecting to move forward and get what you want by copying others is not the same as looking up to the right role models. and progress in life are not dependent on luck. It is dependent on self-belief. Check your levels. 35. It is not beneficial to apologize for what you need in life. It takes away its value to you. If you need it 35. It’s a good idea to know the difference between enjoying the breeze and being pushed around by life. 36. Motivation. If you are needing some don’t look for it on a bad day. Look for it on a good day. Music and dancing can be the key to kick you back into action and results. 37. Black and white. Nothing in life is black and white and yet people want things to be like this—to be “yes” or “no.” Final. Getting what you want in life rarely is so finite. You need to be able to accept a bit of grey area in life to get more of what you want. Being someone reliant on absolutes makes it so much harder. 38. The racing driver does not concentrate on the brick wall at the side of the road as they race at 100+ miles per hour. They concentrate on the bend and success. If you don’t want to hit the wall 40. Choosing to stop thinking about something because it upsets you or angers you doesn’t mean your brain is not trying to process how you feel. You need to make space to process those negatives so that you are back in the flow and doing what you excel at. 41. Being reactive instead of proactive stops you from moving forward. What needs to change? 42. Is your fundamental desire for what you want rooted in love? If it is not 43. When you really need motivation and encouragement and want to reach out to others did you know that helping others also helps you? Altruism is a fast way to feeling good and doing good and it helps you to feel motivated 44. Think back to a time that you overcome adversity or kept going when you really didn’t want to. What skills do you notice? What were you telling yourself? What did you learn about who you are? How will you use that knowledge moving forward? ” and “Can’t” all have power. One holds power over you and one takes ownership. Which one are you using? Can you tell the difference? 46. Whoever said words had no power had never met a powerful coach! Words can be the building blocks to overcoming anything and getting what you want in life. So what words are you allowing in your head? How do you word your goals and ambitions? 47. Feel the fear and do it anyway. Is that a good idea with a starving tiger in the same room? Will you stick around and have a chat about how you wish to overcome the fear of the tiger or will you take action? Move so far away from your fear that it doesn’t exist? And get an expert to help you deal with the tiger? Analogies like this help you see how fear is allowed to stick around and how to get rid of it permanently. 48. Believing that “it is what it is” is a great way to stay stuck. If you choose to believe there is a better way 49. Being honest about what you face is not moaning it’s reaching out. If people see this as moaning they are the wrong people to be turning to. Maybe it’s time to upgrade your network of friends and people you can trust. who do you see?

He teaches men and women to unlock their amazing potential and change the world around them. It was just after 5 AM as I gathered my things to head to the gym. As I walked down the hall I noticed the light on in my daughter Kinsey’s bedroom. She isn’t typically up that early so I decided to peek inside to see what was going on. I saw her sitting in bed with her laptop open and a perplexed look on her face. “What are you doing?” I asked. and she works full-time and goes to school so I didn’t want to question her actions. Still it hit me. This was one way she kept her motivation to study when she was too busy with work. I didn’t want to disturb her further so I slowly closed the door and went on my way pondering the question on my own “how does one maintain their motivation to study when they are too busy with work?” Motivation is an interesting topic that psychologists and scientists of all types have studied for decades. Countless books and articles have been written on the subject and continue to pop up each year. But what motivates us in certain situations? How can we stay motivated when we have so many other things on our minds like work? we first need to understand motivation itself. More specifically the two types of motivation: is an incentive to engage in a specific activity that derives from pleasure in the activity itself rather than because of any external benefits that might be obtained. “I’m going to work hard to get that promotion so I can be more fulfilled at work.” is an external incentive to engage in a specific activity especially motivation arising from the expectation of punishment or reward. “I really want that promotion at work to make more money.” How we are motivated really comes down to whether the motivation is coming from within us or outside us. We all tend to gravitate toward one more than the other but this can depend on a specific situation. Let’s look at the facts from the specific situation in my example and break them down to understand them further. Kinsey works and goes to school like a lot of college students. Kinsey was taking her exam very early in the morning before her usual wake-up time. She was doing the exam before going to work. She had a busy day of work ahead. She acknowledged that she would not want to do it later. All of the facts above point to a . What they don’t tell us specifically is was she motivated intrinsically or extrinsically? I would lean towards intrinsic as there doesn’t seem to be any obvious reward. This example provides some less apparent clues to ways that can help others like you. I’ve compiled the secrets inspired by these clues along with some additional wisdom I’ve learned along the way to help you in maintaining your motivation to study. Here are 11 tips on how to motivate yourself to study even when you’re too busy with work. and a positive mindset can go a long way. Believe that you will achieve your goals and focus on the good things that you have already done. Studies show that being optimistic leads to getting more done and having better overall mental and physical well-being. Once your mindset is in order then the next step is to your success. Begin with a clear vision of what you want to achieve and then experience the feeling of having that success. For example if you know you want to get an A on an exam break down the steps to learning the material to ensure success. 3. Break Your Goals Into Small Attainable Tasks a goal can feel too big like graduating college with straight A’s. Think of the goals you have and break them down into simple if you know you want to get an A on an exam start with gathering the right resources to study and then go further to identify what you need from each resource. Once you drill down far enough help keep you motivated as long as they are healthy. Once you’ve set a goal establish a small reward for achieving it. Whether it’s an edible treat you love or something bigger like a massage this type of external motivator can help maintain your motivation and push you closer to your bigger goals. is a time management system that encourages you to work with the time you have rather than against it. Break the time you have to study into 25-minute chunks separated by 5-minute breaks. Each interval or Pomodoro helps you resist interruptions and trains your brain to focus. You’ll find that the sense of urgency it creates is a fantastic motivator. Once you start to accomplish goals and have successful Pomodoro’s you need to measure it all. If you do not measure and report your progress then you’re probably not making much progress at all. According to Pearson’s Law it improves; when performance is measured and reported Healthy competition is advantageous to keep you moving and it’s great for building your motivation to study. You can positively compete with others to push each other to succeed. If you don’t have anyone else then set up a competition with yourself. see how many Pomodoro’s you can do without breaking focus and looking at your phone. Keep pushing the bar higher and you will strive to reach it. Another way for you to build and maintain your motivation to study is to find a mentor. is a great way to motivate and connect with someone you admire or someone in the field that you are studying. Having a mentor provides a double benefit in that they can provide both assistance and encouragement to you on your road to success. While this is occasionally the role of a mentor you can also find another person studying the same thing as you as your accountability buddy or partner. With both of you focused on the same outcome you can share ideas that you may not have thought of and understand the point of view of your friend. Studies show that publicly committing your goals to someone gives you at least a 65% chance of completing them. Having a specific accountability partner increases your chance of success to 95%. There’s a funny line from an old movie Fast Times at Ridgemont High where a student is disrupting class and the teacher tells him to stop interrupting the class and do what he’s doing on his own time. The student responds doesn’t that make it our time?” Whether you are studying with a group or solo you still need to find the time that works best for your needs and your brain. For some this is first thing in the morning it’s after work when they have decompressed. By measuring your success and the efficiency of your Pomodoro’s you can identify the optimal time for you. Taking the time to move is critical toward moving towards your goals. It doesn’t matter if you study at a desk you still need to move. Take short five-minute breaks after each successful Pomodoro to stand up and move your legs around. This increased blood flow will help keep you awake and get oxygen to your brain. After you’ve completed four consecutive sessions then it’s time for a more extended 15 to 20-minute break. This break is the optimal time to get some fresh air and brief exercise outside. This short amount of time will make a significant difference in your level of motivation. Any of the above tips on their own can help with building and maintaining motivation when put into action. Find the ones that work for you and make them a habit. Once this is done you won’t need the level of external motivation as you will be programmed internally for success. I want to think that I’ve raised Kinsey with some good internal programming and her grades indicate that as well. When she got home from work around 7 PM she came into my office and asked if she could use it for a while. what do you need to do?” I closed the door and left her in the serenity of my cave knowing she would get a good grade on her exam. I ended up being right about the grade but not about the source of her motivation to study that morning. When she emerged from the office about 30 minutes later she quickly turned on the TV. It all came down to the fact that she didn’t want to miss the season finale of The Batchelor. I guess it was more extrinsic than I thought.

What is for loop in Python? you'll learn to iterate over a sequence of elements using the different variations of for loop. What is for loop in Python? The for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence ( ) or other iterable objects. Iterating over a sequence is called traversal. is the variable that takes the value of the item inside the sequence on each iteration. Loop continues until we reach the last item in the sequence. The body of for loop is separated from the rest of the code using indentation. Flowchart of for Loop in Python # Program to find the sum of all numbers stored in a list

# List of numbers
numbers = [6 11]

# variable to store the sum
sum = 0

# iterate over the list
for val in numbers:
    sum = sum+val

print(""The sum is"" We can generate a sequence of numbers using will generate numbers from 0 to 9 (10 numbers). We can also define the start stop and step size as . step_size defaults to 1 if not provided. object is ""lazy"" in a sense because it doesn't generate every number that it ""contains"" when we create it. However it is not an iterator since it supports This function does not store all the values in memory; it would be inefficient. So it remembers the start step size and generates the next number on the go. To force this function to output all the items we can use the function The following example will clarify this. loops to iterate through a sequence of numbers. It can be combined with the function to iterate through a sequence using indexing. Here is an example. # Program to iterate through a list using indexing

genre = ['pop' 'jazz']

# iterate over the list using index
for i in range(len(genre)):
    print(""I like"" I like pop
I like rock
​I like jazz part is executed if the items in the sequence used in for loop exhausts. keyword can be used to stop a for loop. In such cases the else part is ignored. a for loop's else part runs if no break occurs. Here is an example to illustrate this. 5]

for i in digits:
    print(i)
else:
    print(""No items left."") the for loop prints items of the list until the loop exhausts. When the for loop exhausts it executes the block of code in the statement can be used with the keyword was not executed. Let's take an example: # program to display student's marks from record
student_name = 'Soyuj'

marks = {'James': 90 'Arthur': 77}

for student in marks:
    if student == student_name:
        print(marks[student])
        break
else:
    print('No entry with that name found.') No entry with that name found. Join our newsletter for the latest updates. Join our newsletter for the latest updates. Java

The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value the memory location of the first element of the array (generally denoted by the name of the array). The above image can be looked as a top-level view of a staircase where you are at the base of the staircase. Each element can be uniquely identified by their index in the array (in a similar way as you could identify your friends by the step on which they were on in the above example).

1620762419.353466,36292459,https://hackaday.com/2021/05/11/3d-printed-desiccant-container-exploits-infill//#comments,Desiccant is common in 3D printing because the drier plastic filament is the better it prints. Beads of silica gel are great for controlling humidity but finding a porous container for them that is a convenient size is a little harder. 3D printing is a generally useful solution for custom containers but suffers from a slight drawback in this case: printing dense grills or hole patterns is not very efficient for filament-based printers. Dense hole patterns means lots of stopping and starting for the extruder which means a lot of filament retractions and longer print times in general. The green model is used as a modifier to the orange container (of which only the corners are left visible here) [The_Redcoat]’s solution to this is to avoid hole patterns or grills altogether print large wall sections of the container as infill-only with no perimeter layers at all . The exposed infill pattern is dense enough to prevent small beads of desiccant from falling through while allowing ample airflow at the same time. The big advantage here is that infill patterns are also quite efficient for the printer to lay down. Instead of the loads of stops and starts and retractions needed to print a network of holes infill patterns are mostly extruded in layers of unbroken lines. This translates to faster print speeds and an overall more reliable outcome even on printers that might not be as well tuned or calibrated as they could be. to create a stack of segments to use as a modifier in PrusaSlicer. The container is printed as normal except where it intersects with the modifier in which case those areas get printed with infill only and no walls. The result is what you see here: enough airflow for the desiccant to do its job while not allowing any of the beads to escape. It’s a clever use of both a high infill as well as the ability to use a 3D model as a slicing modifier. There’s also another approach to avoiding having to print a dense pattern of holes though it is for light-duty applications only: embedding a material like tulle into a 3D print can make a pretty great fan filter The Russian Woodpecker: Official Bird Of The Cold War Nests In Giant Antenna Neat. Though I find just tipping the beads into the bottom of a vacuum pot and placing stuff on top works well also. May well try a wall free print to see what happens. I just fill a pantyhose leg with them and then yeet it into my air tight storage bin. a nice printing hack to leave out the walls! but i found a much easier solution…i just use ‘formfutura easyfil pla’.  i’m sure most of the other high-end pla is just as good.  the filament that isn’t being used goes in a rubbermaid with a little can of silica but whatever’s on the printer just sits for months in my extremely humid basement and never has any problems.  i only had problems when i was using cheap pla. i’m sure everyone else has reasons for using more temperamental filament or maybe even noticing smaller scale imperfections.  but it was a huge relief for me to find a setup where i don’t have to worry about that sort of thing I understand where you’re coming from but sometimes people want to save a little money especially if they print a ton. Of course there are far simpler solutions than this such as any airtight container with a bag of silica in the center of the reel but it could have its applications. Interesting I may have to try making a flat container like this to place in the bottom of my container.  I always have just used an old tube sock filled with desiccant and tied a knot in the top.  It makes it easy to jam in the voids of the storage container and cotton is pretty heat resistant when drying. and adds a useful tool to the maker’s growing list. I researched filament storage a bit when I got my 3-d printer. (Wanting a tool and not another hobby spending money was more useful than tinkering – your goals may differ.) Air-tight totes are a more expensive than normal totes and you can’t get them locally (probably) but if you’re already using totes they make a good drop-in solution for filament storage. Then a small renewable mini-dehumidifier that has built-in dessicant that changes color when full (of humidity) and can be reformed by plugging it in for a couple of hours. My tote has been full of filament for 6 months now (and counting) with no appreciable color change on the dehumidifier. I got an extra set to use for copper-pipe coils because copper oxidizes from moisture in the air more than just oxygen. Please be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

You go round and round in circles and you either flip a coin or make a snap decision because you’re just too tired to think anymore. Or maybe you simply put off reaching a decision indefinitely which is sometimes easier than making a tough call. Can you relate to this currently? If so then you’re likely suffering from decision fatigue. Poor decisions are made not because of incapability but because arriving at one or more choices takes its toll—to the extent that it severely weakens our mental energy. Now that we know what decision fatigue is let’s explore the primary ways to combat it to enable a stronger mental state coupled with better decision-making. 1. Identify and Make the Most Important Decisions First If you have a busy personal or work life where many tricky decisions are on the table every day this can easily and quickly become overwhelming. In this instance create mental space by initially laying out all situations and challenges requiring a decision. Use a basic software tool or write them down on paper—a notepad file or word document is sufficient. Once you have your complete list carefully pick out the most important items needing a conclusion sooner rather than later. Be mindful of the fact that you can’t treat everything as urgent or requiring immediate attention. There have to be some things that are more important than others! Prioritize and Declare the Appropriate Options Equipped with your most pressing items awaiting decisions add another layer of scrutiny by even further. The result should allow you to identify your most urgent and important tasks without any conflicting priorities. The last part of this exercise is to highlight all of the options to consider for your most important decision and work through them one by one. With the visual representation of options and most critical decisions out the way first you’ll be able to think more clearly and prevent decision fatigue from subtly kicking in. 2. Implement Daily Routines to Automate Less Important Decisions “Shall I have a healthy lunch today?” “Should I wake up earlier tomorrow?” “What time should I prepare dinner tonight?” As trivial as these questions appear to be each one still requires a decision. Stack them on top of other straightforward everyday questions in addition to more significant ones and things can start to add up unpleasantly. Small or less important decisions can eat away at your time and productivity. When many other decisions need to be made in parallel it can lead to decision fatigue. However there’s a method to avoid this. It involves streamlining aspects of your life by automating repetitive decisions and this drives the ability to make better decisions overall. It’s Your Routine—Control It to Create Time for Other Activities Instead of having to decide multiple times per week if you should have a healthy lunch sufficiently ahead of time by dictating what healthy food you’ll eat for lunch every day. In doing so you’re putting that particular decision on autopilot. Your predefined routine commits you to a decision immediately and without hesitation. Invest time into highlighting all of the trivial and recurring situations requiring decisions daily then implement a collective routine that relieves the need for you to give them much thought (if any thought at all). 3. Put a Time Limit on Every Decision Making complex or big decisions increases the risk of draining your energy. This is especially true if you struggle with the fear of making the wrong decision. The doubt and worry bouncing around inside continuously are enough for the majority of people to become fed up and exhausted. you need to be in the right position to act. A tactic to deploy is to essentially force yourself to act by setting a time limit on your decision-making process. What might seem a little daunting—given that it can create a sense of added pressure—actually provides clarity on when you need to conclude since you can see the end in sight. Grow in Confidence by Reducing Hesitation it’s time to move on. You’ll feel good and knowing that you didn’t linger on the choices available. Only consider revisiting a previous decision if something unexpected occurs that impacts it. If that’s the case then follow the same process by ensuring you make the revised decision before a new deadline. 4. Seek Input From Other People—Don’t Decide Alone There’s a time and place to make decisions alone it’s appropriate to involve others. If there’s any degree of struggle in reaching a verdict then seeking opinions from people in your network can lessen the mental burden of indecisiveness. Do you feel comfortable seeking input from other people to help make decisions? Trust and feeling secure in your relationships are crucial to answer “yes” to this question. Explore the Thoughts of Others and Gain a Different Perspective An insecure business leader likely won’t trust their team(s) to help them make decisions. On the other hand an assured and secure business leader realizes they don’t “know it all.” Instead of going solo on all work-related decisions they install trust among their team and get the support required to arrive at the best possible decisions. The ability to make a great decision can depend on the information related to it that’s at your disposal. When faced with a difficult choice don’t be afraid to lean on the relevant people for help. They can offer valid alternatives that are otherwise easy to overlook or hold the key to you making a well-informed decision. 5. Simplify and Lower the Number of Available Options facing an aisle of more than 20 varieties of peanut butter. You have no idea which one to choose and although there are subtle differences they all look fairly similar. No doubt you’ve been in this situation at least once in the past (maybe with a substitute for peanut butter!). This is a classic example of having too many choices—an event that makes you prone to decide to do nothing or waste time by continually pondering on which product to buy. According to the psychological concept known as choice overload simply having too many options can be disruptive and overburdening you might make the easiest choice of avoiding any further thought which often results in the purchase of the wrong item. Extract Meaningful Information and Evaluate Options With a Binary Outcome To simplify and lower your range of options leverage the information available and extract what’s most important for you to make a decision. Is it the price? The protein content? Whether it has sustainable packaging or a combination of multiple details? Keep a tight lid on having too many important components. Prioritize if necessary and implement a binary outcome (of “yes” or “no” / “true” or “false”) to help arrive at decisions earlier such as defining a limited price range that the product must fall within. attention is the currency of the modern world. The ability to concentrate better than the next person can mean the difference between a successful student how can you improve your attention span to make better choices and avoid decision fatigue? There are many strategies and one of the most optimal ways is to eliminate distractions. Today the easiest distractions are a result of technology and the devices running it—all of which are at your fingertips 24/7. Create Extended Periods of Time to Increase Focus These distractions might be small or large but the broader issue is the frequency of them and they repeatedly cause a break in your focus. Dealing with this while trying to make the right decision can be mentally debilitating. Technology distractions commonly relate to email push notifications from mobile apps and scrolling through social media feeds. Access to all of these technologies and tools must be limited to scheduled using a calendar if it’s during a working day). Switch off notifications entirely to all of the above to prevent distractions (where possible) when it’s not time to look at them. This enables you to think more deeply and focus for prolonged periods of time ultimately boosting the chances of making good decisions. Decision fatigue is a real phenomenon that can deplete energy levels and increase stress. It can affect anyone who has to make decisions whether they are minor or major ones. Overcoming decision fatigue needs patience and dedication. By applying the best practices discussed in this article you’ll be on the path to implement valuable changes. These changes will increase your productivity as well as drastically improve your consistency and ability to make the right choices.

(And How It Boosts Productivity) sharing entrepreneurship and productivity tips at Lifehack. the world changed forever when the internet became publicly available. Less than 30 years later our lives have been irrevocably transformed. We can now learn which is both amazing and . This is why the question “What is block scheduling?” has become important. the internet isn’t life’s only distraction and while productivity has become a huge buzzword in recent years it’s simply a measure of progress: Are you doing what matters most? Author Neil Pasricha writes in Harvard Business Review “As our world gets busier and our phones get beepier the scarcest resource for all of us is becoming attention and creative output. And if you’re not taking time to put something new and beautiful out in the world then your value is diminishing fast.” but it’s not always realistic for me. As the founder and CEO of JotForm I need to weigh in on a variety of daily decisions from hiring to product roadmaps to financial planning. I suspect other founders feel the same way. Yet I do believe in the power of focused work which is also why I recommend block scheduling. How to Use Time Blocking to Boost Productivity is a tug-of-war between competing priorities. while multitasking might feel efficient research shows that shifting between tasks can slash productivity by up to 40%. Task-switching leaves what Dr. Sophie Leroy calls “attention residue which means we’re still thinking about a previous activity while we start the next one Here’s where block scheduling can shine. What is block scheduling We usually become familiar with the concept of block scheduling in high school. You likely received a schedule with a certain number of classes per day all blocked according to class time each school year. This is basic block scheduling. block scheduling is the practice of allocating large chunks of time to related tasks. For example you might designate Mondays for meetings and Tuesdays for strategy. Teachers often use block scheduling when creating lesson plans. which we’ll get to shortly. here’s why it matters. Business is essentially and all the myriad activities that entrepreneurs tackle demand focus and minimal distractions. They’re also inherently human tasks that won’t easily be replaced by AI which means your business depends on your ability to go deep. Deep Work: Rules for Success in a Distracted World said in a 2017 interview: “Focus is now the lifeblood of this economy.” Block scheduling can also help you to produce higher quality work in less time. Parkinson’s Law holds that “work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion which is why setting time limits can deflate a ballooning task. How to Use Time Blocking to Boost Productivity Once you know how you’ve been spending your time it’ll be easier to know what to keep and what to throw out when you begin to make your new schedule. 10-11am: Brainstorm and plan for Client A’s project 11am-12pm: Meet with Client A to discuss ideas Read your emotions and abilities throughout the day to tap into what is going to work best for you. the goal is to avoid switching mental gears throughout the day and maybe even the month. I realize this isn’t easy but it can be incredibly valuable. Spending a full day on projects you dislike such as administrative work or meetings but blocking them into a single day can make the rest of your week infinitely more productive and more enjoyable. You’re free to tackle all the entrepreneurial challenges that get your blood flowing. I suggest always scheduling in at least one Family day. It will ensure you make time for the important people in your life and give your brain time to rest. For more on how to stop procrastinating to the task at hand. You’ll respond to the limits you set for yourself and will focus to get things done. In my 14 years at JotForm I’ve realized that business growth means doing more of what makes the biggest impact. I don’t always succeed but I try to focus my time and energy where it matters and I know that busyness is not synonymous with productivity. If you feel the same way give time blocking a try. Share your experiments in scheduling with colleagues and family members so they understand the changes and can support you. don’t worry about getting it right immediately. You may need to get under the hood of your calendar and tinker around a bit. Find what works for you then protect your new schedule at all costs.

What is the use of break and continue in Python? you will learn to use break and continue statements to alter the flow of a loop. Video: Python break and continue Statement What is the use of break and continue in Python? statements can alter the flow of a normal loop. Loops iterate over a block of code until the test expression is false but sometimes we wish to terminate the current iteration or even the whole loop without checking test expression. statements are used in these cases. statement terminates the loop containing it. Control of the program flows to the statement immediately after the body of the loop. statement is inside a nested loop (loop inside another loop) statement will terminate the innermost loop.

If you are asking the question “how do I get over my anxiety?” then this article is for you. I’ve put together a list of my top strategies to help you get over your anxiety. These are the same strategies that have worked for many of my clients over the years and I think they can work for you too! uneasiness or nervousness about an undetermined outcome this worry and uneasiness is quite excessive and goes from something that we can manage on our own to something for which we need professional help.  If your worry or apprehension includes panic attacks or compulsive behaviors consider reaching out to a therapist or a doctor for more professional help. I like to think of anxiety as information—a sign that something is off in your life. It could be a global pandemic or the sign of a larger mental health issue.  Whatever it is it’s good to think this through and be asking the questions that will help you uncover the parts of your life that could use some adjusting. consulting with a therapist or counselor even just for a brief period of time can help decipher some of these questions for you.  And if you want to give it a go on your own well that takes us to the first of my five tips on how to get over anxiety. Here are 5 tips on how to get over anxiety and live a more fulfilling life. You will be amazed by the power of —the path of self-discovery it can lead you down. The best part of journaling is that there is no right or wrong here. It is a private place where you can work through the stuff in your head and figure some things out. There are lots of formats for journaling and I have personally changed my own approach several times depending on what was going on and what I was looking for.  It could be that narrative of your day or bullets with highlights or thoughts of the day. To make the most out of your journaling I would encourage you to push yourself and go beyond a recount of the day’s events. What you really want here is to get into your thought process and understand the feelings behind the thoughts. Timelines can also be a great way to gain some understanding of relationships and the different events in your life. Again it is a matter of what works for you. The pen truly is mightier than. . . the meds?!? My own little psych-mashup. What are the ways you treat yourself? Life is busy and when life demands increase is often one of the first things to fall by the wayside. But it is critical that you build in your “you time” because when stress levels increase If self-care is not something that you are accustomed to thinking about I listed some ideas for you to consider.  Keep in mind that if you schedule it with someone else it might help with accountability. Think about working smaller chunks of time into the workweek and then something a little more extensive on the weekend or even the occasional weekend away. Take your lunchtime away from your desk and get outside for a walk or join a colleague for some casual chitchat. Schedule a massage or trip to the spa/salon. Watch a favorite movie or TV show either on your own or with your favorite person/people. inside or out—anything that gets your heart rate up. Go on an evening or afternoon walk. at home with your kids or on your own.  Play your favorite tunes and do your thing! 40 Self Care Techniques To Rejuvenate And Restore Yourself. Music speaks to our soul. It is a go-to for many of us when in need of a pick-me-up or just blowing off some steam. But sometimes and we don’t incorporate it into our life the way we once did—finding ourselves in a music deficient rut listening to the same boring stuff on the radio. Let this be a reminder to explore the new music out there. Streaming services have revolutionized our access to music and have made it easier than ever before. Explore it and find your jam. music therapy is a growing form of therapy built on the research that it helps decrease pain and—you guessed it—anxiety while also increasing mood Medical Doctors are using it more and more in operating rooms and incorporating it into their practices. If you subscribe to Spotify or Apple Music you can just type in “relaxing music” and you will be sure to find something that will do the trick bringing calm and focus into your life.  In my research for this article I came across some great ones. and they are now a part of my daily rotation. I think of it as the physical energy rising from our feet to our head like a thermometer. Sometimes this energy can even bring us to a place where we feel disconnected from our bodies. The 5 senses exercise will help you reconnect yourself to your body and bring your anxiety levels down to a more manageable level. The 5 senses exercise is a exercise where you connect your 5 senses to your present environment. This is a great way to ground yourself and bring your attention and your energy to the here and now.  What I love about this exercise is that it can be done anywhere and at any time. If you start to feel your anxiety creep up this could be a good strategy to center yourself and possibly ward off a panic attack or prolonged anxiety. Start by taking a few deep breathes inhaling as you count to 3 and then exhaling as you count to 3. identify 5 things you see 3 things you can touch and feel 2 things you can smell and 1 thing you can taste. give yourself a few minutes. This last one is a big one. A lot of times anxiety waxes and wanes with how we think about something. Be mindful of your negative self-talk keeping it in check and working to incorporate perspective. If you know that you are headed into something challenging prepare yourself for it mentally and allow yourself to be ok with the challenge. After all the challenge helps us grow and develop. remember that life is full of choices—granted the options in front of us may be less than ideal but remember that they are there.  Incorporating some of these above strategies could be one of the first choices you make to create change in your life and get a hold of the anxiety A quick easy way to get some perspective is to acknowledge the things that you are grateful for (this is also a mindfulness practice).  The is one way to do this where you write down three to five things that you are grateful for every day. Try it out for a week or so and see how you feel. Of course the more time you practice this the more you will feel the benefits. Anxiety is something that we all experience from time to time working to identify the source of your anxiety will help you discover the best strategies for you. However there are some definite best practices that you can incorporate into your life that are sure to minimize your anxiety and keep you living the active and fulfilling life you want.

Meditation has a long history dating back at least 3000 years ago. It began as a practice within Hinduism. Perhaps this is the reason why when many people think of meditation they imagine someone sitting in a lotus pose What’s missing from this stereotype is an understanding of how much meditation has become a variegated practice of enhancing mental control and repose. Although some people continue to use meditation as part of their religious practice the majority of those who practice meditation do so to reap its many health benefits. This is understandable given how little time it takes to effectively employ meditation daily (about 20 minutes—less time than most people spend catching up on social media). Let’s take a look at the six science-backed health benefits of meditation. One of the more surprising aspects of meditation is its impact on your immune system. It turns out that regularly calming your mind has a way of building up resistance to various illnesses. That’s not to say that meditation is a firewall that will prevent you from ever getting the flu again. Even so the evidence is pretty strong that it can significantly reduce the chances of your becoming sick. An example of this benefit comes from a study that compared three groups of people. There was a control group where no changes were made to their daily lives an exercise group where the members completed a set of daily exercises and a meditation group whose members practiced meditation daily. The study found that after eight weeks the meditation group had 30% fewer respiratory infections when compared to controls. What’s more the severity of those illnesses that did occur among people in the meditation group was significantly less than either the exercise or control group. The takeaway lesson: a regular dose of medication may be just the thing to help guard against some illnesses. How does this work? No one knows for certain. Even so it seems likely that because meditation reduces stress this has the follow-on effect of helping the body stay in a strong state of readiness to combat illness. then you experience stress. Some sources of stress are pleasant moving into your dream home. Many sources of stress are unpleasant like being fired from work the loss of a loved one the cost of having your car repaired. No matter the source and no matter whether the stress is pleasant or cringeworthy it can take a toll on your mental and physical reserves. Consequently finding effective ways to control your stress is important for living a full and rewarding life. Meditation can be one of the tools used to reach this goal. This has been shown in many studies. For example researchers Cara Geary and Susan Rosenthal compared stress levels in two groups of subjects over the course of eight weeks. One group received training in meditation (and then performed it consistently) while the other group coped with stress in their usual manner. the meditation group had significantly less stress after eight weeks. But what is more surprising is that the meditation group continued to have lower stress levels one year later. Moreover they also rated their overall sense of well-being as higher than those who had not received training in meditation. The takeaway lesson is that a brief introduction to meditation can lead to lifestyle changes that have long-term impacts. Everyone has experienced how much sleep impacts their mood and their ability to function effectively. A good night’s rest sets the foundation for the day ahead. Likewise a night of tossing and turning creates an obstacle to pushing forward toward your goals the following day. It’s a well-known problem that 60 million Americans struggle with each year. If you are one of those who chronically wrestle with getting enough good quality sleep meditation may just be the thing that helps you turn the corner. One study that supports this idea included a group of participants that were studied for one year. All participants presented with significantly disturbed sleep. The researchers divided the group into two subgroups. One was taught simple meditation techniques. The other group was given instructions on how to get a better night’s rest (e.g. At the end of the year these two groups showed significant differences in their quality of sleep. The meditation group had markedly improved sleep—similar to what is found with those who use medication to treat sleep problems. They found that the power of meditation to improve the quality of sleep was roughly equal to that of medication or cognitive behavior therapy. The other group—the one that was provided sleep education/instruction—showed only mild improvement in sleep. But it is not just one study that supports the link between meditation and improved sleep. A 2018 review of 18 studies on meditation including a total of 1654 participants found that meditation improved the quality of sleep much more than using a “wait and see” approach. Although practicing meditation does not lead to eternal youth it does appear to reduce the speed at which cells age and eventually decay. It seems likely that part of the mechanism by which meditation induces this effect is by increasing the presence of telomerase an enzyme that protects genes from aging (protects but does not ultimately prevent). cells tend to age faster. When it is in abundance cells age more slowly. Likewise the telomerase enzyme increases when someone is coping well with life and decreases when one feels extremely stressed. Meditation appears to cause an increase in this enzyme and reduces the rate of cellular aging. The mechanism by which this happens may be the reduction in psychological stress that is often seen in those who meditate. By reducing tension in life and increasing a sense of well-being the presence of telomerase should increase. In turn the more slowly they need to be replaced and the slower you age. Several studies show that meditation enhances . It improves blood flow in the brain which may account for the improvements in memory. Although research has not shown that one form of meditation is superior to another it has shown that it only takes about ten minutes of meditation each day for someone to experience these benefits. Moreover the improvements in memory begin to show up soon after someone begins to make meditation a daily habit. An example of this is found in a study that compared two groups of subjects. The first group consisted of people who listened to a 13-minute guided meditation recording each day. The other group of subjects listened to a 13-minute podcast (unrelated to meditation). At the end of eight weeks both groups were tested and the one that performed daily meditation showed significant improvement in both long-term memory and recognition memory. Not surprisingly those that meditated also showed less stress. is part of life that everyone experiences from time to time. It arises anxiety becomes a major source of concern—one that has life-changing consequences: loss of employment Even milder (but chronic) anxiety can have a significant impact on one’s happiness and ability to function at his or her best. many effective approaches reduce or eliminate anxiety. These include Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) and others. But none of these approaches can compete with the simplicity and ease of meditation. A 2010 review of 39 studies involving 1 140 participants concluded that meditation has a positive impact on reducing anxiety. Interestingly the authors also found that meditation is sometimes helpful in reducing anxiety that arises as a function of chronic pain it does not require long periods of meditation for it to be effective in reducing anxiety. Just 20 minutes a day can prove helpful. Many people are likely to see improvement in their anxiety levels by following a ten-minute guided meditation once in the morning and once again in the evening. Below is a short video to help you. Consistently practicing short periods of meditation can result in numerous benefits. Yet it takes very little effort and costs nothing but a brief bit of your time. It is easy to learn and can be done at home Anyone wanting to improve their quality of life can readily take advantage of this tool. The only thing needed is to make a decision—start today. You can easily do that by going to Ron Siegel’s website (he is a Professor at Harvard Medical school) and listening to one of his guided meditations. Barbara Fredrickson Professor of Psychology at the University of North Carolina is one of the foremost researchers on meditation. She has free guided meditations on her website that will get you started enjoying the benefits of making this a daily practice.

1620762457.7186134,81733028,https://hackaday.com/author/dp2cnk/,Desiccant is common in 3D printing because the drier plastic filament is the better it prints. Beads of silica gel are great for controlling humidity but finding a porous container for them that is a convenient size is a little harder. 3D printing is a generally useful solution for custom containers but suffers from a slight drawback in this case: printing dense grills or hole patterns is not very efficient for filament-based printers. Dense hole patterns means lots of stopping and starting for the extruder which means a lot of filament retractions and longer print times in general. The green model is used as a modifier to the orange container (of which only the corners are left visible here) [The_Redcoat]’s solution to this is to avoid hole patterns or grills altogether print large wall sections of the container as infill-only with no perimeter layers at all . The exposed infill pattern is dense enough to prevent small beads of desiccant from falling through while allowing ample airflow at the same time. The big advantage here is that infill patterns are also quite efficient for the printer to lay down. Instead of the loads of stops and starts and retractions needed to print a network of holes infill patterns are mostly extruded in layers of unbroken lines. This translates to faster print speeds and an overall more reliable outcome even on printers that might not be as well tuned or calibrated as they could be. to create a stack of segments to use as a modifier in PrusaSlicer. The container is printed as normal except where it intersects with the modifier in which case those areas get printed with infill only and no walls. The result is what you see here: enough airflow for the desiccant to do its job while not allowing any of the beads to escape. It’s a clever use of both a high infill as well as the ability to use a 3D model as a slicing modifier. There’s also another approach to avoiding having to print a dense pattern of holes though it is for light-duty applications only: embedding a material like tulle into a 3D print can make a pretty great fan filter Commodore 64 Emulator In VR Delivers A Full 80s Experience The simulated color CRT monitor looks surprisingly convincing in VR. One way to play with vintage hardware without owning the hardware is to use an emulator [omni_shaNker] announced taking it to the next level by using VR to deliver a complete Commodore 64 system complete with a native 80s habitat playset! This is a pretty interesting angle for simulating vintage hardware especially since the emulator is paired with what looks like a pretty convincing CRT monitor effect in VR not to mention a virtual 5.25″ floppy drive that makes compellingly authentic sounds. and supports a variety of VR hardware but for owners of Oculus headsets the application is also available on SideQuest for maximum convenience. SideQuest is essentially an off-the-books app store for managing software that is neither approved nor distributed by Facebook. Oculus is owned by Facebook and Facebook is keen to keep a tight grip on their hardware As functional as the application is there are still improvements and optimizations to be made. To address this a call for beta testers on Reddit so if that’s up your alley be sure to get in touch. A video demonstration and overview that is chock-full of technical details is also embedded below; be sure to give it a watch to see what the project is all about. “Commodore 64 Emulator In VR Delivers A Full 80s Experience” Is Actually An ESP32 Development Board showing optional color-coded 40-pin header (top) ATMegaZero ESP32-S2 is currently being funded with a campaign on GroupGets and it’s a microcontroller board modeled after the Raspberry Pi Zero’s form factor. That means instead of the embedded Linux system most of us know and love it’s an ESP32-based development board with the same shape and 40-pin GPIO header as the Pi Zero. As a bonus it has some neat features like a connector for inexpensive SSD1306 and SH1106-based OLED displays. Being able to use existing accessories can go a long way towards easing a project’s creation and leveraging that is one of the reasons for sharing the Pi Zero form factor. Ease of use is also one of the goals so the boards will ship with and can also be used with the Arduino IDE. If a microcontroller board using the Pi Zero form factor looks a bit familiar you might be remembering the which was based on the Atmel ATMega32U4 but to get wireless communications one needed to attach a separate ESP8266 module. This newer board keeps the ATMegaZero name and footprint to provide all the necessary functions. CircuitPython has been a feature in a wide variety of projects and hacks and it’s a fine way to make a microcontroller board easy to use right out of the box. This DIY Split-Flap Display Does Both Time And Weather With little more than four economical stepper motors an awfully slick Smart Flip Clock that can display not only the time but also weather data as well. This is done by adding a few extra graphics to some of the split-flaps so numbers can also be used to indicate temperature and weather conditions succinctly. Displaying the time has to do without a colon (so but being able to show temperature and weather conditions more than makes up for it. 32 degrees and a mix of sun and cloud it looks as though each split-flap has thirteen unique positions. The first ten are for numerals 0 through 9 and the rest are either blank or used to make up a few different weather icons with different combinations. A Python script runs on the Raspberry Pi and retrieves weather data from and the GPIO header drives the display via four geared stepper motors and driver boards. The rest of the hardware is 3D printed and [Thomas] helpfully provides CAD models in STEP format alongside the STL files. The basic design of a split-flap display is really quite versatile and enterprising hackers have been putting delightful new twists on them for years. There has been a split-flap display used as a kind of flip-book animation and we’ve also had the pleasure of seeing an entire Tarot deck used for esoteric With 3D Printing And Epoxy Like the looks of stained glass but not the amount of work [Northern Geometry] shows how to sidestep all that nonsense and use a 3D printed frame and some alcohol-based inks to create a pretty good fake stained-glass effect piece of art A smooth polypropylene board is the key to a glassy smooth back. [Northern Geometry] has played with this idea before but shares some refinements and tips on getting the best results. One suggestion is to begin by securely taping the 3D printed frame to a smooth polypropylene board as a backer. Giving the cured resin a smooth surface is important to get the right look and since resin will not bond to the polypropylene it can be used as a backer to get that done. pour a small amount of epoxy into each cavity and ensure it gets into every corner then let it cure. The thin bottom layer of resin will seal things as well as create a glassy-smooth backing that is the perfect foundation for finishing the piece with colored resin as needed. and everything has had plenty of time to cure fully just pop the piece off the board. Check it out in the video embedded below where [Northern Geometry] shows the process from start to finish. With 3D Printing And Epoxy” What To Expect From 3D Scanning And How To Work With It 3D scanning and 3D printing may sound like a natural match for one another but they don’t always play together as easily and nicely as one would hope. I’ll explain what one can expect by highlighting three use cases the average hacker encounters and how well they do (or don’t) work. With this you’ll have a better idea of how 3D scanning can meet your part design and 3D printing needs. How Well Some Things (Don’t) Work Most 3D printing enthusiasts sooner or later become interested in whether 3D scanning can make their lives and projects easier. Here are a three different intersections of 3D scanning and CAD along with a few words on how well each can be expected to work. Use scans to make copies of an object. Objects might be functional things like fixtures or appliance parts but depends on the object Make a CAD model from a source object. The goal is a 1:1 model Use 3D scanning instead of creating the object in CAD. Obtain an accurate model of complex shapes that can’t easily be measured or modeled any other way. objects that are attached to something else or can’t be easily moved body parts like heads or faces and objects with many curves. Useful to make sure a 3D printed object will fit into or on something else. Creating a CAD model of a part for engineering purposes is not the goal. one wants a 3D model of an object and that’s exactly what 3D scanning creates so what’s the problem? The problem is that not all 3D models are alike and useful for the same things. “What To Expect From 3D Scanning And How To Work With It” DIY Wireless Serial Adapter Speaks (True) RS-232 There is a gotcha lurking in wait for hackers who look at a piece of equipment see a port labeled “Serial / RS-232” and start to get ideas. The issue is the fact that the older the equipment the more likely it is to be a bit old-fashioned about how it expects to speak RS-232. Vintage electronics may expect the serial data to be at bipolar voltage levels that are higher than what the typical microcontroller is used to slinging and that was the situation [g3gg0] faced with some vintage benchtop equipment. Rather than deal with cables and wired adapters a wireless adapter with WiFi and Bluetooth on one end and true RS-232 on the other The adapter features an ESP32 and is attached to a DB-9 plug so it’s nice and small. It uses the chip to communicate at 3 V logic levels on the microcontroller side supports bipolar logic up to +/-13 V on the vintage hardware side and a rudimentary web interface allows setting hardware parameters like baud rate. The nice thing about the ST3232 transceiver is that it is not only small but can work from a 3 V supply with only four 0.1 uF capacitors needed for the internal charge pumps. As for actually using the adapter [g3gg0] says that the adapter’s serial port is exposed over TCP on port 23 (Telnet) which is supported by some programs and hardware. Alternately one can connect an ESP32 to one’s computer over USB and run firmware that bridges any serial data directly to the adapter on the other end. and you can see a brief tour of the adapter in the video “DIY Wireless Serial Adapter Speaks (True) RS-232” The Russian Woodpecker: Official Bird Of The Cold War Nests In Giant Antenna And What It Can Do For You How To Build A Turbo Car The Cheap SpaceX Drops The Ball On Catching Fairings South Australia Vs.

The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). There are many real-life examples of a stack. Consider an example of plates stacked over one another in the canteen. The plate which is at the top is the first one to be removed i.e. the plate which has been placed at the bottommost position remains in the stack for the longest period of time. So it can be simply seen to follow LIFO(Last In First Out)/FILO(First In Last Out) order.

The signal was a rapid 10 Hz tapping that sounded like a woodpecker or a helicopter thup-thupping on the roof. It had a wide bandwidth of 40 kHz and sometimes exceeded 10 MW. human for scale. Image by Corsairoz This was during the Cold War and plenty of people rushed to the conclusion that it was some sort of Soviet mind control scheme or weather control experiment. But amateur radio operators traced the mysterious signal to an over-the-horizon radar antenna near Chernobyl Ukraine (then part of the USSR) and they named it the Russian Woodpecker. Here’s a clip of the sound The frequency-hopping Woodpecker signal was so strong that it made communication impossible on certain channels and could even be heard across telephone lines when conditions were right. Several countries filed official complaints with the USSR through the UN but there was no stopping the Russian Woodpecker. Russia wouldn’t even own up to the signal’s existence which has since been traced to that is nearly half a mile long and at 490 feet stands slightly taller than the Great Pyramid at Giza. This imposing steel structure stands within the irradiated forest near Pripyat an idyllic town founded in 1970 to house the Chernobyl nuclear plant workers. Pictured above is the transmitter or Duga-3 depending on who you ask. Located 30 miles northeast of Chernobyl on old Soviet maps the area is simply labeled Boy Scout Camp. Today It was such a secret that the government denied it’s existence yet was being heard all over the world. What was this mammoth installation used for? The Duga radar was one of two transmitter/receiver pairs built in response to the Distant Early Warning Line (DEW Line) a smattering of antennas that were built above the Arctic Circle in a joint effort between the US and Canada. Like any the theory behind Russia’s system was that Moscow would have about 25 minutes to respond to ICBMs in kind rather than having a mere 10 minutes or so in which to duck and cover and kiss the world goodbye. To get a better idea of the scale of this thing check out Tom Scott’s brief tour in the video embedded below. and Pinetree radar lines. Image via Over-the-horizon radar relies on a similar phenomenon that delivers such great range for amateur radio — the signals bounce off the ionosphere and are thus able to overcome the curvature of the Earth which allows it to detect launches much earlier than standard ground radar can. a film crew led by an artist from Kiev attempts to uncover the mysteries of the antenna. He believes that the nuclear incident at Chernobyl was orchestrated to divert attention away from the structure which was due for an upcoming inspection that it was never going to pass. the Duga antenna cost twice as much as the Chernobyl plant itself — around 7 billion Rubles. Putting this cost in historical context is tricky. Using the Treasury Reporting Rates of Exchange as of June 30 we find the exchange rate at the time was 0.7550 Rubles to Dollars. That places the 1976 cost at about $9.27 billion. Inflation adjusted that’s $43.16 billion in 2021 value — a mind-boggling sum that makes us question the documentary’s cost assessment (and the accuracy of our own conversion process). Some sources say the radar system never worked. Other sources claim that it did and that they were able to detect every single Shuttle launch with it. And when the Woodpecker was reported to be interfering with Russian SOS signals they altered the frequency. But after they did that it stopped working because of interference from Aurora borealis. companies and individuals built blanker circuitry to tune out the incessant tapping. Conventional interference blanker circuits work by looking for short pulse duration with fast rise time and generate a signal to shut off a gate in the signal path. But these would be useless to drown out the Woodpecker because they don’t work on lower-amplitude pulses. The Moscow Muffler WB-1. Image via The problem with blanking the Woodpecker’s signal was that it had a large bandwidth and inconsistent pulses. Ionospheric reflection would stretch the pulses and sometimes create echoes turning it into a game of whack-a-mole. To make matters worse they often looked like regular signals making it even harder to isolate the Woodpecker from whatever the desired signal was. The Datong SRB2 Woodpecker Blanker. Image via which worked by generating an internal signal of 10 or 16 Hz to blank out the Woodpecker. But if the ionosphere was stretching the pulses the blanker’s pulse width had to be increased to compensate which often meant losing the desired signal in the shuffle. was much more of a set-it-and-forget-it deal page 39). The SRB2 worked much like the Moscow Muffler by generating an internal clock and comparing it with the Woodpecker signal. The nifty thing about the SRB2 is that it was automatic. Once it found a match it tailored the blocking pulse to suit by dialing in the pulse width the number of blanking pulses and their ideal positions. Conversely the Moscow Muffler used fixed-width pulses so you had to keep messing with it in order to keep the signal blanked out. The Russian Woodpecker interference stopped after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989 around which time its existence was finally confirmed by the Soviet government. By then the Russians had moved on to satellites for their early warning purposes. a similar signal started to terrorize the shortwaves though not as strongly as the original. It is believed to come from a new Russian OTH radar system called which looks to be nearly as big as Duga. If you want to check it out and let us know what you hear! Original Game Boy Powered Up With GBA Motherboard The Russian Woodpecker: Official Bird Of The Cold War Nests In Giant Antenna There was a DEW Line radar in Dickinson ND when I was a kid. on the same hill that the radar stood Mike Rowe did an episode of “Dirty Jobs” who discovered that if they manually adjusted the dot rate on their automatic keyers to match the Woodpecker’s PRF it would change its transmitting frequency. Technically illegal (interference with another broadcaster) but effective in clearing the Woodpecker out of the ham bands. It might have been more fun to transmit back on the doppler-shifted frequency to simulate an ICBM launch! Guess they’d have to admit to owning the Woodpecker to complain about it! I have to wonder if that was the project’s official budget or if it was just one of the shells that got moved around to hide that something else was over budget. Someone please launch a nuclear missile so this construction wouldn’t be in vain  :D the purpose is to detect those launches and determine IFF “This was during the Cold War and plenty of people rushed to the conclusion that it was some sort of Soviet mind control scheme or weather control experiment.” Oh people and their wacky conspiracies. “He believes that the nuclear incident at Chernobyl was orchestrated to divert attention away from the structure which was due for an upcoming inspection that it was never going to pass.” If you are also into quadcopters here is a cool video on Duga (from back when Rotor Riot wasn’t lame) Gave a listen at about 15:20 UTC on 14.270 and all I heard was bleed over from somebody operating sideband phone on the 20M band. This is from southern Arizona Detecting something the size of the shuttle with an RCS of a warehouse isn’t exactly useful for something supposedly capable of detecting an ICBM during launch/boost phase. I rather suspect the Russians have caught up. Duga-3 is referenced in the excellent S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow Of Chernobyl video game. In the game there’s a large antennae array called the brain scorcher that turns people into mindless zombies. Please be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

What is a function in Python? and types of functions. Also you'll learn to create a function in Python. What is a function in Python? a function is a group of related statements that performs a specific task. Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks. As our program grows larger and larger functions make it more organized and manageable. it avoids repetition and makes the code reusable. Above shown is a function definition that consists of the following components. that marks the start of the function header. A function name to uniquely identify the function. Function naming follows the same rules of writing identifiers in Python Parameters (arguments) through which we pass values to a function. They are optional. A colon (:) to mark the end of the function header. Optional documentation string (docstring) to describe what the function does. One or more valid python statements that make up the function body. Statements must have the same indentation level (usually 4 spaces). statement to return a value from the function. def greet(name):
    """"""
    This function greets to
    the person passed in as
    a parameter
    """"""
    print(""Hello "" + name + "". Good morning!"") How to call a function in python? Once we have defined a function we can call it from another function program or even the Python prompt. To call a function we simply type the function name with appropriate parameters. Try running the above code in the Python program with the function definition to see the output. def greet(name):
    """"""
    This function greets to
    the person passed in as
    a parameter
    """"""
    print(""Hello "" + name + "". Good morning!"")

greet('Paul') The first string after the function header is called the docstring and is short for documentation string. It is briefly used to explain what a function does. documentation is a good programming practice. Unless you can remember what you had for dinner last week we have a docstring immediately below the function header. We generally use triple quotes so that docstring can extend up to multiple lines. This string is available to us as the Try running the following into the Python shell to see the output. >>> print(greet.__doc__)

    This function greets to
    the person passed in as
    a parameter To learn more about docstrings in Python statement is used to exit a function and go back to the place from where it was called. This statement can contain an expression that gets evaluated and the value is returned. If there is no expression in the statement or the statement itself is not present inside a function then the function will return the directly prints the name and no def absolute_value(num):
    """"""This function returns the absolute
    value of the entered number""""""

    if num >= 0:
        return num
    else:
        return -num


print(absolute_value(2))

print(absolute_value(-4)) Scope of a variable is the portion of a program where the variable is recognized. Parameters and variables defined inside a function are not visible from outside the function. Hence they have a local scope. The lifetime of a variable is the period throughout which the variable exits in the memory. The lifetime of variables inside a function is as long as the function executes. They are destroyed once we return from the function. Hence a function does not remember the value of a variable from its previous calls. Here is an example to illustrate the scope of a variable inside a function. def my_func():
	x = 10
	print(""Value inside function:"" Value inside function: 10
Value outside function: 20 we can see that the value of is 20 initially. Even though the function it did not affect the value outside the function. inside the function is different (local to the function) from the one outside. Although they have the same names they are two different variables with different scopes. variables outside of the function are visible from inside. They have a global scope. We can read these values from inside the function but cannot change (write) them. In order to modify the value of variables outside the function they must be declared as global variables using the keyword we can divide functions into the following two types: - Functions that are built into Python. - Functions defined by the users themselves.

The signal was a rapid 10 Hz tapping that sounded like a woodpecker or a helicopter thup-thupping on the roof. It had a wide bandwidth of 40 kHz and sometimes exceeded 10 MW. human for scale. Image by Corsairoz This was during the Cold War and plenty of people rushed to the conclusion that it was some sort of Soviet mind control scheme or weather control experiment. But amateur radio operators traced the mysterious signal to an over-the-horizon radar antenna near Chernobyl Ukraine (then part of the USSR) and they named it the Russian Woodpecker. Here’s a clip of the sound The frequency-hopping Woodpecker signal was so strong that it made communication impossible on certain channels and could even be heard across telephone lines when conditions were right. Several countries filed official complaints with the USSR through the UN but there was no stopping the Russian Woodpecker. Russia wouldn’t even own up to the signal’s existence which has since been traced to that is nearly half a mile long and at 490 feet stands slightly taller than the Great Pyramid at Giza. This imposing steel structure stands within the irradiated forest near Pripyat an idyllic town founded in 1970 to house the Chernobyl nuclear plant workers. Pictured above is the transmitter or Duga-3 depending on who you ask. Located 30 miles northeast of Chernobyl on old Soviet maps the area is simply labeled Boy Scout Camp. Today It was such a secret that the government denied it’s existence yet was being heard all over the world. What was this mammoth installation used for? The Duga radar was one of two transmitter/receiver pairs built in response to the Distant Early Warning Line (DEW Line) a smattering of antennas that were built above the Arctic Circle in a joint effort between the US and Canada. Like any the theory behind Russia’s system was that Moscow would have about 25 minutes to respond to ICBMs in kind rather than having a mere 10 minutes or so in which to duck and cover and kiss the world goodbye. To get a better idea of the scale of this thing check out Tom Scott’s brief tour in the video embedded below. and Pinetree radar lines. Image via Over-the-horizon radar relies on a similar phenomenon that delivers such great range for amateur radio — the signals bounce off the ionosphere and are thus able to overcome the curvature of the Earth which allows it to detect launches much earlier than standard ground radar can. a film crew led by an artist from Kiev attempts to uncover the mysteries of the antenna. He believes that the nuclear incident at Chernobyl was orchestrated to divert attention away from the structure which was due for an upcoming inspection that it was never going to pass. the Duga antenna cost twice as much as the Chernobyl plant itself — around 7 billion Rubles. Putting this cost in historical context is tricky. Using the Treasury Reporting Rates of Exchange as of June 30 we find the exchange rate at the time was 0.7550 Rubles to Dollars. That places the 1976 cost at about $9.27 billion. Inflation adjusted that’s $43.16 billion in 2021 value — a mind-boggling sum that makes us question the documentary’s cost assessment (and the accuracy of our own conversion process). Some sources say the radar system never worked. Other sources claim that it did and that they were able to detect every single Shuttle launch with it. And when the Woodpecker was reported to be interfering with Russian SOS signals they altered the frequency. But after they did that it stopped working because of interference from Aurora borealis. companies and individuals built blanker circuitry to tune out the incessant tapping. Conventional interference blanker circuits work by looking for short pulse duration with fast rise time and generate a signal to shut off a gate in the signal path. But these would be useless to drown out the Woodpecker because they don’t work on lower-amplitude pulses. The Moscow Muffler WB-1. Image via The problem with blanking the Woodpecker’s signal was that it had a large bandwidth and inconsistent pulses. Ionospheric reflection would stretch the pulses and sometimes create echoes turning it into a game of whack-a-mole. To make matters worse they often looked like regular signals making it even harder to isolate the Woodpecker from whatever the desired signal was. The Datong SRB2 Woodpecker Blanker. Image via which worked by generating an internal signal of 10 or 16 Hz to blank out the Woodpecker. But if the ionosphere was stretching the pulses the blanker’s pulse width had to be increased to compensate which often meant losing the desired signal in the shuffle. was much more of a set-it-and-forget-it deal page 39). The SRB2 worked much like the Moscow Muffler by generating an internal clock and comparing it with the Woodpecker signal. The nifty thing about the SRB2 is that it was automatic. Once it found a match it tailored the blocking pulse to suit by dialing in the pulse width the number of blanking pulses and their ideal positions. Conversely the Moscow Muffler used fixed-width pulses so you had to keep messing with it in order to keep the signal blanked out. The Russian Woodpecker interference stopped after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989 around which time its existence was finally confirmed by the Soviet government. By then the Russians had moved on to satellites for their early warning purposes. a similar signal started to terrorize the shortwaves though not as strongly as the original. It is believed to come from a new Russian OTH radar system called which looks to be nearly as big as Duga. If you want to check it out and let us know what you hear! Original Game Boy Powered Up With GBA Motherboard The Russian Woodpecker: Official Bird Of The Cold War Nests In Giant Antenna There was a DEW Line radar in Dickinson ND when I was a kid. on the same hill that the radar stood Mike Rowe did an episode of “Dirty Jobs” who discovered that if they manually adjusted the dot rate on their automatic keyers to match the Woodpecker’s PRF it would change its transmitting frequency. Technically illegal (interference with another broadcaster) but effective in clearing the Woodpecker out of the ham bands. It might have been more fun to transmit back on the doppler-shifted frequency to simulate an ICBM launch! Guess they’d have to admit to owning the Woodpecker to complain about it! I have to wonder if that was the project’s official budget or if it was just one of the shells that got moved around to hide that something else was over budget. Someone please launch a nuclear missile so this construction wouldn’t be in vain  :D the purpose is to detect those launches and determine IFF “This was during the Cold War and plenty of people rushed to the conclusion that it was some sort of Soviet mind control scheme or weather control experiment.” Oh people and their wacky conspiracies. “He believes that the nuclear incident at Chernobyl was orchestrated to divert attention away from the structure which was due for an upcoming inspection that it was never going to pass.” If you are also into quadcopters here is a cool video on Duga (from back when Rotor Riot wasn’t lame) Gave a listen at about 15:20 UTC on 14.270 and all I heard was bleed over from somebody operating sideband phone on the 20M band. This is from southern Arizona Detecting something the size of the shuttle with an RCS of a warehouse isn’t exactly useful for something supposedly capable of detecting an ICBM during launch/boost phase. I rather suspect the Russians have caught up. Duga-3 is referenced in the excellent S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow Of Chernobyl video game. In the game there’s a large antennae array called the brain scorcher that turns people into mindless zombies. Please be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

In this article you will learn to define such functions using default we learned about defining a function and calling it. Otherwise the function call will result in an error. Here is an example. msg):
    """"""This function greets to
    the person with the provided message""""""
    print(""Hello"" Since we have called this function with two arguments it runs smoothly and we do not get any error. If we call it with a different number of arguments the interpreter will show an error message. Below is a call to this function with one and no arguments along with their respective error messages. >>> greet(""Monica"")    # only one argument
TypeError: greet() missing 1 required positional argument: 'msg' >>> greet()    # no arguments
TypeError: greet() missing 2 required positional arguments: 'name' and 'msg' functions had a fixed number of arguments. In Python there are other ways to define a function that can take variable number of arguments. Three different forms of this type are described below. Function arguments can have default values in Python. We can provide a default value to an argument by using the assignment operator (=). Here is an example. msg=""Good morning!""):
    """"""
    This function greets to
    the person with the
    provided message.

    If the message is not provided it defaults to ""Good
    morning!""
    """"""

    print(""Hello"" does not have a default value and is required (mandatory) during a call. it is optional during a call. If a value is provided it will overwrite the default value. Any number of arguments in a function can have a default value. But once we have a default argument all the arguments to its right must also have default values. non-default arguments cannot follow default arguments. For example if we had defined the function header above as: We would get an error as: SyntaxError: non-default argument follows default argument When we call a function with some values these values get assigned to the arguments according to their position. when we called it as Python allows functions to be called using keyword arguments. When we call functions in this way the order (position) of the arguments can be changed. Following calls to the above function are all valid and produce the same result. # 2 keyword arguments
greet(name = ""Bruce"" msg = ""How do you do?"")

# 2 keyword arguments (out of order)
greet(msg = ""How do you do?"" msg = ""How do you do?"") we can mix positional arguments with keyword arguments during a function call. But we must keep in mind that keyword arguments must follow positional arguments. Having a positional argument after keyword arguments will result in errors. For example the function call as follows: SyntaxError: non-keyword arg after keyword arg we do not know in advance the number of arguments that will be passed into a function. Python allows us to handle this kind of situation through function calls with an arbitrary number of arguments. we use an asterisk (*) before the parameter name to denote this kind of argument. Here is an example. def greet(*names):
    """"""This function greets all
    the person in the names tuple.""""""

    # names is a tuple with arguments
    for name in names:
        print(""Hello"" we have called the function with multiple arguments. These arguments get wrapped up into a tuple before being passed into the function.

Recursion is the process of defining something in terms of itself. A physical world example would be to place two parallel mirrors facing each other. Any object in between them would be reflected recursively. can call other functions. It is even possible for the function to call itself. These types of construct are termed as recursive functions. The following image shows the working of a recursive function called Following is an example of a recursive function to find the factorial of an integer. Factorial of a number is the product of all the integers from 1 to that number. For example the factorial of 6 (denoted as 6!) is def factorial(x):
    """"""This is a recursive function
    to find the factorial of an integer""""""

    if x == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return (x * factorial(x-1))


num = 3
print(""The factorial of"" The factorial of 3 is 6 is a recursive function as it calls itself. When we call this function with a positive integer it will recursively call itself by decreasing the number. Each function multiplies the number with the factorial of the number below it until it is equal to one. This recursive call can be explained in the following steps. Let's look at an image that shows a step-by-step process of what is going on: Working of a recursive factorial function Our recursion ends when the number reduces to 1. This is called the base condition. Every recursive function must have a base condition that stops the recursion or else the function calls itself infinitely. The Python interpreter limits the depths of recursion to help avoid infinite recursions the maximum depth of recursion is . If the limit is crossed . Let's look at one such condition. def recursor():

RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded Recursive functions make the code look clean and elegant. A complex task can be broken down into simpler sub-problems using recursion. Sequence generation is easier with recursion than using some nested iteration. Sometimes the logic behind recursion is hard to follow through. Recursive calls are expensive (inefficient) as they take up a lot of memory and time. Recursive functions are hard to debug. Join our newsletter for the latest updates.

The signal was a rapid 10 Hz tapping that sounded like a woodpecker or a helicopter thup-thupping on the roof. It had a wide bandwidth of 40 kHz and sometimes exceeded 10 MW. human for scale. Image by Corsairoz This was during the Cold War and plenty of people rushed to the conclusion that it was some sort of Soviet mind control scheme or weather control experiment. But amateur radio operators traced the mysterious signal to an over-the-horizon radar antenna near Chernobyl Ukraine (then part of the USSR) and they named it the Russian Woodpecker. Here’s a clip of the sound The frequency-hopping Woodpecker signal was so strong that it made communication impossible on certain channels and could even be heard across telephone lines when conditions were right. Several countries filed official complaints with the USSR through the UN but there was no stopping the Russian Woodpecker. Russia wouldn’t even own up to the signal’s existence which has since been traced to that is nearly half a mile long and at 490 feet stands slightly taller than the Great Pyramid at Giza. This imposing steel structure stands within the irradiated forest near Pripyat an idyllic town founded in 1970 to house the Chernobyl nuclear plant workers. Pictured above is the transmitter or Duga-3 depending on who you ask. Located 30 miles northeast of Chernobyl on old Soviet maps the area is simply labeled Boy Scout Camp. Today It was such a secret that the government denied it’s existence yet was being heard all over the world.

Plenty of spaces around the abode have had to do double and triple duty as we navigate work and everything in between. Although it’s been a great time to engage in hobbies and even find new ones where exactly are we supposed put all the stuff that accumulates? usable solution for doing electronics work that could be easily packed away. They happened upon a tool case being thrown out a great one-stop solution for whenever the urge to play with pixies strikes [Fabse89] started by stripping the box out to the bare walls and modeling the inside in Fusion360. Then they built and cut an acrylic insert that holds two power supplies and a soldering station. There are fixed 5 V and 12 V outputs on one power supply plus a variable supply that maxes out at 48 V. When it came to tool storage options [Fabse89] got lucky with a small seldom-used set of plastic drawers that fits perfectly next to the power station. These hold all the small tools like flush cutters and a de-soldering pump. The top section of the case folds back and is the perfect place for component storage boxes. We think this is a tidy solution and especially like that you don’t have to dismantle it to use it — can be used with everything in place and packed up quickly. We also like that the front lid pulls down into a makeshift table so this really could go anywhere with mains power. Acrylic not rugged enough for your tastes? Here’s a DIY supply that doubles as a melee weapon MIT’s Hair-Brushing Robot Untangles Difficult Robotics Problem Whether you care to admit it or not hair is important to self-image and not being able to deal with it yourself feels like a real loss of independence. To help people with limited mobility researchers at MIT CSAIL have created a hair-brushing robot that combines a camera with force feedback and closed-loop control to adjust to any hair type from straight to curly on the fly. They achieved this by examining hair as double helices of soft fibers and developed a mathematical model to untangle them much like a human would — by working from the bottom up. It may look like a hairbrush strapped to a robot arm but there’s more to it than that. Before it ever starts brushing the robot’s camera takes a picture that gets cropped down to a rectangle of pure hair data. This image is converted to grayscale and then the program analyzes the x/y image gradients. The straighter the hair the more edges it has in the x-direction whereas curly hair is more evenly distributed. Finally the program computes the ratio of straightness to curliness and uses this number to set the pain threshold. The brush is equipped with sensors that measure the forces being exerted on the hair and scalp as it’s being brushed and compares this input to a baseline established by a human who used it to brush their own hair. We think it would be awesome if the robot could grasp the section of hair first so the person can’t feel the pull against their scalp and start by brushing out the ends before brushing from the scalp down but we admit that would be asking a lot. Maybe they could get it to respond to exclamations like ‘ow’ and ‘ouch’. Human trials are still in the works. For now watch it gently brush out various wigs after the break. Even though we have wavy hair that tangles quite easily we would probably let this robot brush our hair. “MIT’s Hair-Brushing Robot Untangles Difficult Robotics Problem” K’nex Pinball Machine Is A Playable Work Of Art It’s really a wonder that we missed this one what with all the extra time in front of a computer we’ve had over the last year or so. But better late than never (a little at a time because there’s quite a lot to look at) [Tyler Bower]’s pinball machine built entirely from K’nex Where do we even start? This is a full-size pinball machine and 3′ wide. [Tyler] estimates that it’s made from about 16 or around 73 pounds of plastic much of which was obtained locally and is secondhand. Many of those pieces make up the ten drill motor-driven chain lifts in the back — these move the ball through the machine after it goes through one of the track triggers and return it to the playfield in various delightful ways. there are nine of them total and some are harder to get to than others. They all involve some really amazing K’nex movement and each one uses aluminum foil switches to trigger scoring through a MaKey MaKey. Of course there’s a multi-ball mode but our favorite has to be the trap door in the playfield that gets you to the mini pinball game in the upper left because only the best pinball games have some kind of mini game. Either that or our favorite is the rotating arm that swings around gracefully and drops the ball on a track. Anyway all nine elements are explored in the video after the break which frankly we could watch on repeat. If you’re hungry for more details there’s quite a bit of info in the description. The only thing this machine is missing is a tilt switch but as you’ll see in the video it would probably get triggered quite often. Is this somehow not cool enough for you? Here’s a slightly bigger K’nex ball machine that doesn’t seem to move as much but also isn’t a full freaking pinball machine complete with meta game. “K’nex Pinball Machine Is A Playable Work Of Art” Auto Strummer Can Plectrum The Whole Flat-Strumming Spectrum and dexterity in both hands. Depending on your mobility level rocking out with your axe might be impossible unless you could somehow hold down the strings and have a robot do the strumming for you [Jacob Stambaugh]’s Auto Strummer uses six lighted buttons to tell the hidden internal pick which string(s) to strum which it does with the help of an Arduino Pro Mini and a stepper motor. If two or more buttons are pressed all the strings between the outermost pair selected will be strummed. That little golden knob near the top is a pot that controls the strumming tempo. [Jacob]’s impressive 3D-printed enclosure attaches to the guitar with a pair of spring-loaded clamps that grasp the edge of the sound hole. But don’t fret — there’s plenty of foam padding under every point that touches the soundboard. We were worried that the enclosure would block or muffle the sound even though it sits about an inch above the hole. But as you can hear in the video after the break that doesn’t seem to be the case — it sounds fantastic. but love to play Guitar Hero? “Auto Strummer Can Plectrum The Whole Flat-Strumming Spectrum” Shake Up Your Magic 8-Ball With GIFs When you need quick answers to life’s burning yes or no questions most reasonable people reach for a Magic 8-Ball. But since we all have most of those answers memorized at this point has the Magic 8-Ball sunk to a cliche and become less useful in the present day? because [DJ Harrigan] has given the Magic 8-Ball a modern makeover by redesigning it to serve up suitable GIFs instead . Inside that beautifully-engineered snap-together shell lives a Raspberry Pi 3 and it displays the GIFs on a 240 x 240 IPS LCD screen. [DJ] wanted to use a round screen but couldn’t find one with a good enough refresh rate. Maybe someday. We love this build either way. Our favorite part is probably the power button which is incorporated as the period in the ‘.gif’ logo. Although it takes a bit longer to get this 8-Ball ready to answer questions it’s worth the wait. And besides the splash screen is nice. Once it’s booted up and ready to go you still have to shake it — for this [DJ] used a simple DIY spring-based tilt switch. Check out the demo and build video after the break. If you want to build one for yourself the files are up on Need decision-making support on the go?

Us too. But not [codaris] who bought an under-desk bike to get in a bit of cycling while banging away on the keyboard. The only bad thing about this bike is the accompanying app — it’s all-around weak and requires too many steps just to get to peddlin’. It pays to know thyself and [codaris] knows that this will be a major de-motivator and made a desktop app that does it all including/starting up as soon as the pedals start spinning. [codaris] built a Windows application that displays workout data in real time and then saves the stats in a SQLite database after the pedaling stops. It took a fair amount of work to get there logging the Bluetooth traffic during a ride and comparing that with Wireshark output from a live session to decode the communication between the bike and the app. Turns out there are six commands total and [codaris] really only needs three — Connect The app displays the elapsed workout time and the current RPM. We love that it starts logging and displaying data as soon as [codaris] starts pedaling because that would be a major goal for us There’s more than one way to hack a bike. [codaris] was inspired by [ptx2]’s excellent work to un-brick a much more expensive bike with a Raspberry P The Russian Woodpecker: Official Bird Of The Cold War Nests In Giant Antenna And What It Can Do For You How To Build A Turbo Car The Cheap SpaceX Drops The Ball On Catching Fairings South Australia Vs.

Set up the environment variables Step 9. Flash onto the Device This guide shows how to get started with the ESP-WROVER-KIT V4.1 development board and also provides information about its functionality and configuration options. For the description of other ESP-WROVER-KIT versions You can skip the introduction sections and go directly to Section ESP-WROVER-KIT is an ESP32-based development board produced by ESP-WROVER-KIT features the following integrated components: Its another distinguishing feature is the embedded FTDI FT2232HL chip - an advanced multi-interface USB bridge. This chip enables to use JTAG for direct debugging of ESP32 through the USB interface without a separate JTAG debugger. ESP-WROVER-KIT makes development convenient Most of the ESP32 I/O pins are broken out to the board’s pin headers for easy access. ESP32’s GPIO16 and GPIO17 are used as chip select and clock signals for PSRAM. By default the two GPIOs are not broken out to the board’s pin headers in order to ensure reliable performance. The block diagram below shows the main components of ESP-WROVER-KIT and their interconnections. The following two figures and the table below describe the key components and controls of the ESP-WROVER-KIT board. The table below provides description in the following manner: Starting from the first picture’s top right corner and going clockwise Then moving on to the second picture The FT2232 chip serves as a multi-protocol USB-to-serial bridge which can be programmed and controlled via USB to provide communication with ESP32. FT2232 also features USB-to-JTAG interface which is available on channel A of the chip while USB-to-serial is on channel B. The FT2232 chip enhances user-friendliness in terms of application development and debugging. See External precision 32.768 kHz crystal oscillator serves as a clock with low-power consumption while the chip is in Deep-sleep mode. Zero-ohm resistor intended as a placeholder for a current shunt can be desoldered or replaced with a current shunt to facilitate the measurement of ESP32’s current consumption in different modes. This ESP32 module features 64-Mbit PSRAM for flexible extended storage and data processing capabilities. Four red LEDs connected to the GPIO pins of FT2232. Intended for future use. Serial port. The serial TX/RX signals of FT2232 and ESP32 are broken out to the inward and outward sides of JP2 respectively. By default these pairs of pins are connected with jumpers. To use ESP32’s serial interface remove the jumpers and connect another external serial device to the respective pins. ESP32 uses its SPI interface to access flash and PSRAM memory inside the module. Use these pins to connect ESP32 to another SPI device. In this case an extra chip select (CS) signal is needed. Please note that the voltage of this interface is 3.3V. Serial port flow control signals: the pins are not connected to the circuitry by default. To enable them short the respective pins of JP14 with jumpers. JTAG interface. JTAG signals of FT2232 and ESP32 are broken out to the inward and outward sides of JP2 respectively. By default these pairs of pins are disconnected. To enable JTAG short the respective pins with jumpers as shown in Section USB interface. Power supply for the board as well as the communication interface between a computer and the board. initiates Firmware Download mode for downloading firmware through the serial port. Power On/Off Switch. Toggling toward the Power supply selector interface. The board can be powered either via USB or via the 5V Input interface. Select the power source with a jumper. For more details 5V power supply interface for a standard coaxial power connector center positive. This interface can be more convenient when the board is operating autonomously (not connected to a computer). This red LED turns on when power is supplied to the board NCP1117(1A). 5V-to-3.3V LDO. NCP1117 can provide a maximum current of 1A. The LDO on the board has a fixed output voltage. Although the user can install an LDO with adjustable output voltage. For details a standard OV7670 camera module. green and blue (RGB) light emitting diodes (LEDs) can be controlled by pulse width modulation (PWM). All the pins on the ESP32 module are broken out to pin headers. You can program ESP32 to enable multiple functions Useful for developing applications that access MicroSD card for data storage and retrieval. Support for mounting and interfacing a 3.2” SPI (standard 4-wire Serial Peripheral Interface) LCD There are three jumper blocks available to set up the board functionality. The most frequently required options are listed in the table below. Power ESP-WROVER-KIT via an external power supply Enable RTS/CTS flow control for serial communication Some pins / terminals of ESP32 are allocated for use with the onboard or external hardware. If that hardware is not used nothing is plugged into the Camera (JP4) header then these GPIOs can be used for other purposes. such as GPIO0 or GPIO2 have multiple functions and some of them are shared among onboard and external peripheral devices. Certain combinations of peripherals cannot work together. For example it is not possible to do JTAG debugging of an application that is using SD card because several pins are shared by JTAG and the SD card slot. peripherals can coexist under certain conditions. This is applicable to LCD screen and SD card that share only a single pin GPIO21. This pin is used to provide D/C (Data / Control) signal for the LCD as well as the CD (Card Detect) signal read from the SD card slot. If the card detect functionality is not essential then it may be disabled by removing R167 so both LCD and SD may operate together. For more details on which pins are shared among which peripherals please refer to the table in the next section. The JP1 connector consists of 14x2 male pins whose functions are shown in the middle two “I/O” columns of the table below. The two “Shared With” columns on both sides describe where else on the board a certain GPIO is used. Boot - Boot button / SW2 Since GPIO32 and GPIO33 are connected to the oscillator by default they are not connected to the JP1 I/O connector to maintain signal integrity. This allocation may be changed from the oscillator to JP1 by desoldering the zero-ohm resistors from positions R11 / R23 and re-soldering them to positions R12 / R24. The module’s flash bus is connected to the jumper block JP2 through zero-ohm resistors R140 ~ R145. If the flash memory needs to operate at the frequency of 80 MHz for reasons such as improving the integrity of bus signals you can desolder these resistors to disconnect the module’s flash bus from the pin header JP2.

<p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.lifehack.org/905620/motivation-to-study"">How To Motivate Yourself To Study When You&#8217;re Too Busy With Work</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.lifehack.org"">Lifehack</a>.</p> <p>It was just after 5 AM as I gathered my things to head to the gym. As I walked down the hall I noticed the light on in my daughter Kinsey&#8217;s bedroom. She isn&#8217;t typically up that early so I decided to peek inside to see what was going on.</p>
<p>As I opened the door I saw her sitting in bed with her laptop open and a perplexed look on her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; I asked.<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;m doing some last-minute studying before I take my pharmacology exam.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Why are you doing it so early?&#8221; I questioned.<br />
&#8220;I need to get it done before I go to work because I have a full day and I won&#8217;t want to do it later.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kinsey is a great student and she works full-time and goes to school so I didn&#8217;t want to question her actions. Still it hit me. This was one way she kept her motivation to study when she was too busy with work.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t want to disturb her further so I slowly closed the door and went on my way pondering the question on my own &#8220;how does one maintain their motivation to study when they are too busy with work?&#8221;</p>
<p>Motivation is an interesting topic that psychologists and scientists of all types have studied for decades. Countless books and articles have been written on the subject and continue to pop up each year. But what motivates us in certain situations? How can we stay motivated when we have so many other things on our minds like work?</p>
<p>To answer these questions we first need to understand motivation itself. More specifically the two types of motivation: <strong>intrinsic</strong> and <strong>extrinsic.</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/898494/what-is-intrinsic-motivation"">Intrinsic motivation</a></strong> is an incentive to engage in a specific activity that derives from pleasure in the activity itself rather than because of any external benefits that might be obtained.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_7180_1"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7180_1');"">[1]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7180_1""></span> It sounds like &#8220;I&#8217;m going to work hard to get that promotion so I can be more fulfilled at work.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the other hand <strong><a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/902485/what-is-extrinsic-motivation"">extrinsic motivation</a> </strong>is an external incentive to engage in a specific activity especially motivation arising from the expectation of punishment or reward.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_7180_2"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7180_2');"">[2]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7180_2""></span> It sounds like &#8220;I really want that promotion at work to make more money.&#8221;</p>
<p>How we are motivated really comes down to whether the motivation is coming from within us or outside us. We all tend to gravitate toward one more than the other but this can depend on a specific situation.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the facts from the specific situation in my example and break them down to understand them further.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kinsey works and goes to school like a lot of college students.</li>
<li>Kinsey was taking her exam very early in the morning before her usual wake-up time.</li>
<li>She was doing the exam before going to work.</li>
<li>She had a busy day of work ahead.</li>
<li>She acknowledged that she would not want to do it later.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the facts above point to a <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/8-things-highly-motivated-people-differently.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">motivated individual</a>. What they don&#8217;t tell us specifically is was she motivated intrinsically or extrinsically? I would lean towards intrinsic as there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any obvious reward.</p>
<p>This example provides some less apparent clues to ways that can help others like you. I&#8217;ve compiled the secrets inspired by these clues along with some additional wisdom I&#8217;ve learned along the way to help you in maintaining your motivation to study.</p>
<p>Here are 11 tips on how to motivate yourself to study even when you&#8217;re too busy with work.</p>
<h2>1. Have a Great mindset</h2>
<p>It all starts here and a positive mindset can go a long way. Believe that you will achieve your goals and focus on the good things that you have already done. Studies show that being optimistic leads to getting more done and having better overall mental and physical well-being.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_7180_3"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7180_3');"">[3]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7180_3""></span></p>
<h2>2. Visualize Success</h2>
<p>Once your mindset is in order then the next step is to <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/883519/visualization-techniques"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">visualize</a> your success. Begin with a clear vision of what you want to achieve and then experience the feeling of having that success. For example if you know you want to get an A on an exam break down the steps to learning the material to ensure success.</p>
<h2>3. Break Your Goals Into Small Attainable Tasks</h2>
<p>Sometimes a goal can feel too big like graduating college with straight A&#8217;s. Think of the goals you have and break them down into simple if you know you want to get an A on an exam start with gathering the right resources to study and then go further to identify what you need from each resource. Once you drill down far enough everything becomes attainable.</p>
<h2>4. Reward yourself</h2>
<p><a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/900026/reward-system-in-brain"">Rewards</a> help keep you motivated as long as they are healthy. Once you&#8217;ve set a goal establish a small reward for achieving it. Whether it&#8217;s an edible treat you love or something bigger like a massage this type of external motivator can help maintain your motivation and push you closer to your bigger goals.</p>
<h2>5. Pomodoro for the Win</h2>
<p>The <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/the-pomodoro-technique-is-it-right-for-you.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Pomodoro Technique</a> is a time management system that encourages you to work with the time you have rather than against it. Break the time you have to study into 25-minute chunks separated by 5-minute breaks. Each interval or Pomodoro helps you resist interruptions and trains your brain to focus. You&#8217;ll find that the sense of urgency it creates is a fantastic motivator.</p>
<h2>6. Measure Progress</h2>
<p>Once you start to accomplish goals and have successful Pomodoro&#8217;s you need to measure it all. If you do not measure and report your progress then you&#8217;re probably not making much progress at all. According to Pearson&#8217;s Law it improves; when performance is measured and reported it improves exponentially.</p>
<h2>7. Make It a Competition</h2>
<p>Healthy competition is advantageous to keep you moving and it&#8217;s great for building your motivation to study. You can positively compete with others to push each other to succeed. If you don&#8217;t have anyone else then set up a competition with yourself.</p>
<p>For example see how many Pomodoro&#8217;s you can do without breaking focus and looking at your phone. Keep pushing the bar higher and you will strive to reach it.</p>
<h2>8. Find a Mentor</h2>
<p>Another way for you to build and maintain your motivation to study is to find a mentor. <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/582049/good-mentor-hard-find-what-look-for-mentor"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Having a mentor</a> is a great way to motivate and connect with someone you admire or someone in the field that you are studying. Having a mentor provides a double benefit in that they can provide both assistance and encouragement to you on your road to success.</p>
<h2>9. Get an Accountability Buddy</h2>
<p>While this is occasionally the role of a mentor you can also find another person studying the same thing as you as your accountability buddy or partner. With both of you focused on the same outcome you can share ideas that you may not have thought of and understand the point of view of your friend.</p>
<p>Studies show that publicly committing your goals to someone gives you at least a 65% chance of completing them. Having a specific accountability partner increases your chance of success to 95%.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_7180_4"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7180_4');"">[4]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7180_4""></span></p>
<h2>10. Find &#8220;Your&#8221; Time</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a funny line from an old movie Fast Times at Ridgemont High where a student is disrupting class and the teacher tells him to stop interrupting the class and do what he&#8217;s doing on his own time. The student responds doesn&#8217;t that make it our time?&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether you are studying with a group or solo you still need to find the time that works best for your needs and your brain. For some this is first thing in the morning it&#8217;s after work when they have decompressed. By measuring your success and the efficiency of your Pomodoro&#8217;s you can identify the optimal time for you.</p>
<h2>11. Move</h2>
<p>Taking the time to move is critical toward moving towards your goals. It doesn&#8217;t matter if you study at a desk you still need to move. Take short five-minute breaks after each successful Pomodoro to stand up and move your legs around. This increased blood flow will help keep you awake and get oxygen to your brain.</p>
<p>After you&#8217;ve completed four consecutive sessions then it&#8217;s time for a more extended 15 to 20-minute break. This break is the optimal time to get some fresh air and brief exercise outside. This short amount of time will make a significant difference in your level of motivation.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Any of the above tips on their own can help with building and maintaining motivation when put into action. Find the ones that work for you and make them a habit. Once this is done you won&#8217;t need the level of external motivation as you will be programmed internally for success.</p>
<p>I want to think that I&#8217;ve raised Kinsey with some good internal programming and her grades indicate that as well. When she got home from work around 7 PM she came into my office and asked if she could use it for a while.</p>
<p>I said what do you need to do?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Take my pharmacology exam.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I thought you took it this morning.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;I was going to but the opening time was wrong on the exam so it didn&#8217;t open until noon today instead of midnight.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Oh I get it now. Sure so you have peace and quiet.&#8221;</p>
<p>I closed the door and left her in the serenity of my cave knowing she would get a good grade on her exam. I ended up being right about the grade but not about the source of her motivation to study that morning.</p>
<p>When she emerged from the office about 30 minutes later she quickly turned on the TV. It all came down to the fact that she didn&#8217;t want to miss the season finale of The Batchelor. I guess it was more extrinsic than I thought.</p>

<p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.lifehack.org/900271/brain-breaks-for-kids"">20 Energizing Brain Breaks For Kids</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.lifehack.org"">Lifehack</a>.</p> <p>From coaching martial arts to children as young as four years old I very quickly came to the understanding that if I wanted to help kids progress their skills I needed to find a way to help them focus more consistently in my class.</p>
<p>There are two key ways I found when it came to improving my students&#8217; level of focus:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make what we&#8217;re doing more interesting. Nothing is off the table here—from having ninja clowns on the rampage in a lesson to including popular games with a martial arts theme tapping into the student&#8217;s love of fun to help them focus.</li>
<li>Introduce brain breaks.</li>
</ol>
<p>Brain breaks are small mental breaks that help the kids stay more focused. Think of the brain as a fuel gauge that shows the information you can consciously hold in your mind at any given moment. When the kids are focused and working hard on their tasks the meter is usually full. They can easily concentrate and pass experiences into their long-term memory.</p>
<p>But when the needle starts to drop you may observe that your kids are feeling anxious or looking restless. New information and knowledge are not getting processed from the staging area or working memory into the long-term memory.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_1129_1"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1129_1');"">[1]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1129_1""></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s here that brain breaks make the most difference as they allow us to &#8220;top-up the tank&#8221; or reset the gauge so that we can continue to learn and focus and at a higher level.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been home tutoring you&#8217;ll appreciate that brain breaks can help kids in many ways. They can reduce stress and frustration. Think of those times when you&#8217;re helping your kids solve a difficult problem. It&#8217;s taxing for you both and when compounded with the energy loss after a day at school or watching TV. The stress effect can be compounded and it&#8217;s here that brain breaks can be a lifesaver.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_1129_2"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1129_2');"">[2]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1129_2""></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1rem;"">The following is a selection of brain break ideas for kids. You&#8217;ll see that some are physical activities while others are more relaxing. It&#8217;s always great to test them out to see which ones connect the best with your children.</span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s okay to repeat the same brain breaks. Having a clear name and mission to a break can help keep your child excited knowing that they&#8217;ll have the opportunity to take part in a future round of the activity.</p>

<h2>Active Brain Breaks</h2>
<p>Here are some active brain breaks for kids that you can try out.</p>
<h3>1. Swapsies</h3>
<p>Have the participants stand behind a chair. Call out a character trait like &#8220;everyone with brown eyes.&#8221; You then swap places with someone else who has the same characteristic. If you have nothing that matches you stay put!</p>
<p>Examples: “Everyone with trainers on.” “Everyone who is left-handed.” “Everyone who is wearing yellow.”</p>
<h3>2. Dance Party</h3>
<p>Put five or six different types of songs on Spotify including a classic like &#8220;baby shark or the hamster dance.&#8221; Dim the lights if possible and have the kids dance to the tunes. Then change the tunes and change the dance style. It&#8217;s silly and fun.</p>
<h3>3. Freeze Dance</h3>
<p>Similar to Dance Party except that when the music stops students have to stay perfectly still until the music restarts. You can make this even more fun by trying to make the students smile. If they smile they are out and have to sit down.</p>
<h3>4. Keep It Up</h3>
<p>Students must keep a balloon from touching the floor. You can add multiple balloons. You can make it more competitive by having different balloons of two different colors and split people into teams. Whoever keeps the balloons up the longest or the team with the most balloons in the air with a timer of 60 seconds wins.</p>
<h3>5. Simon Says</h3>
<p>This brain break for kids is an old favorite. You can also mix it up with martial arts moves etc.</p>
<h3>6. Animal Movement</h3>
<p>Move like different animals. It&#8217;s fun for younger children. We use Flamingo where you stand on one leg and walk like a penguin.</p>
<h3>7. Find It Fast</h3>
<p>&#8220;Find It Fast&#8221; is a scavenger hunt variation. Call an item out in the room and kids have to stand by it. For example find something with a face etc.</p>
<h3>8. The Frog</h3>
<p>Physical Challenges can be excellent fun. We have one in the martial arts class called &#8220;The Frog&#8221; where you squat like a frog then lean forward so your head and feet are off the floor. These are all old <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/789579/kids-yoga-exercises"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">yoga poses</a> so have a look through a booklet or website for some safe ideas. Other examples are grabbing your nose with your left hand and touching your knee with your right elbow.</p>
<h3>9. Pizza Delivery Time</h3>
<p>Give the students paper plates and tell them to hold the plates above their head on a flat hand. They then run around the room and try to keep the plate in their hand. You can make it more challenging by having other students try to knock others&#8217; plates off. There&#8217;s usually a 3-star jump penalty if your plate touches the floor.</p>
<h3>10. Limbo</h3>
<p>We use martial arts belts and the students take turns going underneath the belts. Fun music creates an awesome atmosphere here.</p>
<h3>11. Human Knot</h3>
<p>Split the group of people and have everyone link hands under and over. That&#8217;s making knots between everyone in the group. Have the other students try to untangle them and return everyone back into a circle.</p>
<h3>12. Feather Balance</h3>
<p>This brain break for kids works well with gentle music and you can use a balloon or a straw if you don’t have a feather handy.</p>
<h3>13. Stack them high</h3>
<p>The students should have plastic cups and paper squares. The goal is to make a tower as high as possible or it could be to make a triangle or even a pyramid.</p>
<h2>Relaxing Brain Breaks</h2>
<p>We talked about brain breaks for kids that are being used to energize the students. But they can also be used to calm and relax them. We&#8217;re more familiar with the term mindfulness but it&#8217;s the same idea. These are brain breaks for kids that reduce stress and anxiety.</p>
<h3>14. Meditation</h3>
<p><a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/788281/meditation-for-kids"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Meditation</a> is a popular way to reduce anxiety. There are lots of great examples already pre-recorded on YouTube that you can follow along with. Below is a useful classroom meditation example.</p>

<h3>15. Kaleidoscope</h3>
<p>Kaleidoscopes are fun ways to relax. They are mesmerizing and like a peaceful vortex that sucks you into them. Below is a great example of a visual online one you can use.</p>
<div class=""entry-content-asset""><iframe loading=""lazy"" title=""Relaxing Third Eye Chakra Mandala Meditation"" width=""706"" height=""397"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/FsfZxijCQpU?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1&#038;origin=https://www.lifehack.org"" frameborder=""0"" allow=""accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<h3>16. Reading/Listening to a Story</h3>
<p>When I surveyed the members of our martial arts club about how their kids employ brain breaks at home there was a clear winner among the families—listening to a story or reading a story. The feedback was that the process of daydreaming a little helps the kids to recharge. But it goes without saying that the story needs to be engaging.</p>
<h3>17. Doodling</h3>
<p>My personal favorite way to brain break as a kid was to doodle. Doodling gives your child a few minutes to draw anything they want. It can be calming for them and it&#8217;s a lot more fun if you have different types of pens or crayons available to use. Add some soft music and you have a simple way to take some time to relax.</p>
<h3>18. Coloring Sheets</h3>
<p>Coloring sheets are another way to relax the mind. There&#8217;s lots of great coloring in pads available but here are some links to public resources shared on the internet that are great examples.</p>

<h3>19. Deep Breathing</h3>
<p><a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/845536/deep-breathing-exercises"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Deep breathing</a> is an epic way to help your child slow down. It is a quick way to relieve anxiety so that they feel more ready for the next task ahead.</p>
<p>Try this: put your hands on your tummy breathe in through the nose and feel your belly expand like a balloon. Hold it here then slowly breathe out through the mouth while feeling your stomach get smaller. Repeat this 10 times. Use the following counts: breath in for 4 seconds and breath out for 4 seconds.</p>
<h3>20. Going Outside</h3>
<p>Go outside was the second most popular response from our parent&#8217;s survey about brain breaks for kids at home. Fresh air always feels nice. You can combine this with a treasure hunt looking for different colored cars or even types of trees if you&#8217;re familiar with these.</p>
<p>My personal favorite is using a <a href=""https://learn.freshcap.com/tips/mushroom-identification-app/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">mushroom spotting app</a> on our phones and finding a mushroom or toadstool then using the app to identify its name. This is surprisingly engaging for children. But a few safety rules about not touching them is important. It gives kids a change of scenery and helps revitalize the senses providing a welcome break from their homework.</p>
<h2>How Often Should You Introduce Brain Breaks?</h2>
<p>The key to brain breaks is their timing. If you can introduce them before you notice that your kids are entering deep fatigue or their loss of focus has set in. You&#8217;ll find a great balance between breaks and effort.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve observed from my martial arts coaching that younger students have a smaller amount of working memory than older kids. My formula is for five minutes of technical training we provide five minutes of brain breaks for students under seven years old. Plus we coach to 15 minutes of training to five minutes of brain breaks for children under 12 years.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Implementing calming brain breaks for kids is a really efficient way of introducing brain breaks. You have a quick way to allow your students to learn about regulating themselves. Balancing their mind and energy is a useful skill and you can take this with you everywhere you go.</p>
<p>Our martial arts center revolutionized our approach to coaching by using brain breaks for kids. We found that although we were teaching less technical skills there was now consistent progress from the students. Plus and are having more fun. This is a win overall.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been having challenges with your kids focusing at home maybe try a mixture of the calming and active breaks to see which types work best for your kids.</p>

<p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.lifehack.org/2313/productivity-boost-how-to-start-your-day-at-500-am"">Productivity Boost: How to start your day at 5:00 AM</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.lifehack.org"">Lifehack</a>.</p> <p>I have been an early-riser for over a year now. Monday through Friday I wake up at 5:00 AM without hitting the snooze button even once. I never take naps and rarely feel tired throughout the day. The following is my advice on how to start your day (everyday) at 5:00 AM.The idea of waking up early and starting the day at or before the sunrise is the desire of many people. Many highly successful people attribute their success to rising early. Early-risers have more productive mornings and report less stress on average than &#8220;late-risers.&#8221; However the task of waking up at 5:00 AM can seem extremely daunting. This article will present five tips about how to physically wake up at 5:00 AM and how to get yourself mentally ready to have a productive day.</p>
<p>Many people simply &#8220;can&#8217;t&#8221; get up early because they are stuck in a routine. Whether this is getting to bed unnecessarily late or waiting until the absolute last possible moment before getting out of bed &#8220;sleeping in&#8221; can easily consume your entire morning. The following tips will let you break the &#8220;sleeping in&#8221; routine.</p>
<h2>Relocate your alarm clock.</h2>
<p>Having an alarm clock too close to your bed is the number one reason people simply cannot get up in the morning. If your alarm clock is within arms reach of your bed or if you can turn your alarm clock off without getting out of bed you are creating an unnecessarily difficult situation for yourself. Before I became an early-riser there were many times that I would turn off my alarm without even waking up enough to remember turning it off. I recommend moving your alarm clock far enough away from your bed that you have to get completely out of bed to turn it off. I keep my alarm clock in the bathroom. This may not be possible for all living arrangements I use my cellphone as an alarm clock and putting it in the bathroom makes perfect sense. In order to turn off my alarm I have to get completely out of bed and since going to the restroom and taking a shower are the first two things I do everyday keeping the alarm clock in the bathroom streamlines the start of my morning.</p>
<h2>Scrap the snooze.</h2>
<p>The snooze feature on all modern alarm clocks serves absolutely no constructive purpose. Don&#8217;t even try the &#8220;it helps me slowly wake up&#8221; lie. I recommend buying an alarm that does not have a snooze button. If you can&#8217;t find an alarm without a snooze button never read the instructions so you will never know how long your snooze button lasts. Not knowing whether it waits 10 minutes or 60 minutes should be enough of a deterrent to get you to stop using it.</p>
<h2>Change up your buzzer</h2>
<p>If you use the same buzzer day in and day out you begin to develop a tolerance to the sound. The alarm clock will slowly become less effective at waking you up over time. Most newer alarm clocks will let you set a different buzzer tone for the different days of the week. If you change your buzzer frequently you will have an easier time waking up.</p>
<h2>Make a puzzle</h2>
<p>If you absolutely cannot wake up without repetitive snoozing try making a puzzle for yourself. It doesn&#8217;t take rocket science to understand that the longer your alarm is going off the more awake you will become. Try making your alarm very difficult to turn off by putting it under the sink putting it under the bed by forcing yourself to complete a puzzle to turn it off. Try putting your alarm into a combination-locked box and make yourself put in the combination in order to turn off the alarm &#8212; it&#8217;s annoying but extremely effective!</p>
<h2>Get into a routine</h2>
<p>Getting up at 5:00 AM is much easier if you are doing it Monday through Friday rather than sporadically during the week. I recommend setting an alarm once that repeats everyday. Also going to bed at about the same time every night is an important factor to having a productive morning. Learn how much sleep you need to get in order to not feel exhausted the following day. Some people can get by on 4-6 hours while most need 7-8.</p>
<h2>Have a reason</h2>
<p>Make sure you have a specific reason to get up in the morning. Getting up at 5:00 AM just for the heck of it is a lot more difficult than if you are getting up early to plan your day get an early start on work etc. I recommend finding something you want to do for yourself in the morning. It will be a lot easier to get up if you are guaranteed to do something fun for yourself &#8212; compare this to going on vacation. You probably have no problem waking up very early on vacation or during holidays. My goal every morning is to bring that excitement to the day by doing something fun for myself.</p>
<p>As I previously mentioned I have been using these tips for a very long time. Joining the world of early-risers has been a great decision. I feel less stressed and I feel happier than I did when I was a late-riser. If you follow these tips you can become an early-riser too. Do you have any tips that I didn&#8217;t mention?

<p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.lifehack.org/905610/tools-for-learning"">10 Tools That Make Learning At Home More Efficient</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.lifehack.org"">Lifehack</a>.</p> <p>In a world where everybody is going more remote every day it&#8217;s critical to keep a constant eye on your development and growth. You can never stop learning so it&#8217;s more critical than ever to have the right tools for learning at your disposal and keep yourself on that path.</p>
<p>Whether you are a student or a professional continuing your education the year 2020 has proved to be a metaphorical wrench thrown in the wheels of your learning. You found yourself physically isolated from your tribes and disconnected from your <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/794619/learning-management-system"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">learning environments</a>. Once again technology came to the rescue and many companies put out great new tools for learning meant to fill that very gap.</p>
<p>Some tools existed before but they took off as their popularity exploded in recent years. You should take from this that these tools are not only saving grace in dire times but you can also use them in your day-to-day process to make learning more efficient.</p>
<p>There are many aspects of learning I wanted to focus on four primary areas that are critical when it comes to distance learning or learning on your own:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reading</strong> &#8211; the basic source of knowledge</li>
<li><strong>Courses</strong> &#8211; advanced learning programs</li>
<li><strong>Retaining information</strong> &#8211; making learning stick</li>
<li><strong>Archiving your knowledge</strong> &#8211; finding and accessing your knowledgebase easily</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Learn as though you would never be able to master it; hold it as though you would be in fear of losing it.&#8221;—Confucius</p></blockquote>

<h2>Reading &#8211; The Source of Knowledge</h2>
<p>A vast majority of learning happens through reading and we often find sources of inspiration for our knowledge in books. You might find it challenging to identify the books you should read and you invest in a book only to learn mid-way that you&#8217;re not enjoying the style or that it simply doesn&#8217;t address what you need.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I believe that two apps will come very handy to allow you to identify what to read while also getting a few golden nuggets along the way.</p>
<p>These apps are also beneficial when trying to find something new to learn perhaps something totally <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/903993/motivation-to-learn"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">outside of your comfort zone</a>. They will help you sort through the tons of books out there and quickly figure out what sparks your interest.</p>
<h3>1. Blinkist</h3>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-907039"" src=""https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blinkist.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1747"" height=""1240"" srcset=""https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blinkist.jpg 1747w https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blinkist-1536x1090.jpg 1536w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1747px) 100vw 1747px"" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m an avid reader and my biggest problem after going through the essential books on specific topics is finding new things to learn from. Especially since self-publishing became a thing it&#8217;s becoming harder and harder to sort through all the options out there and pick something that will help and that you will enjoy and I must&#8217;ve read about fifty different books due to that. Blinkist picks books and summarizes them in a series of short audio snippets called blinks. Typically a Blinkist entry takes about 15 minutes to listen to (or read if you prefer).</p>
<p>The app has a robust tagging system so you can select the books you need based on the type or based on others you&#8217;ve already read. This app will improve your efficiency in identifying new books to read and learn from. Also it will help you waste a minimal amount of time finding out what books you shouldn&#8217;t waste your time on.</p>

<h3>2. Headway</h3>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-907040"" src=""https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/headway.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1747"" height=""1240"" srcset=""https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/headway.jpg 1747w https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/headway-1536x1090.jpg 1536w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1747px) 100vw 1747px"" /></p>
<p>Headway is similar to Blinkist but it&#8217;s a newer addition to the market. Their app is clean and the user interface is intuitive and easy to use.</p>
<p>The tool is excellent at identifying your reading patterns and suggests what to read next based on your history. Although their library is not as extensive as Blinkist&#8217;s for the time being they put efforts into creating summaries for new books that hit the shelves as well as some of the more widely known non-fiction books.</p>

<h2>Courses &#8211; Going Deeper</h2>
<p>The online course market is another industry that has exploded over the past few years. You can find courses on everything for all levels. Teachers come from all walks of life sharing their specific knowledge through these convenient tools for learning.</p>
<p>I must have gone through a dozen courses in the last year and I found them easy to digest and consume and highly efficient. You can install these tools on your phone or tablet and use them while driving or before bedtime.</p>
<p>Because the courses have different levels you can start from a beginner course and see if that works for you. Later you can upgrade to higher levels and continue to learn on that subject. You&#8217;ll find it particularly effective to combine a book you&#8217;ve identified with a course available on one of these apps in the same category.</p>
<h3>3. Udemy</h3>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-907041"" src=""https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/udemy.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1747"" height=""1240"" srcset=""https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/udemy.jpg 1747w https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/udemy-1536x1090.jpg 1536w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1747px) 100vw 1747px"" /></p>
<p>Udemy is a site and app that provides online learning through video courses. The content is varied and it&#8217;s geared toward personal and professional development.</p>
<p>The site itself is user-friendly and finding what you need is straightforward. Because thousands of users are using the app you benefit from many reviews and testimonials for each course.</p>
<p>The one drawback for Udemy is that they don&#8217;t have a subscription model so if you want to take many classes you have to pay for each one individually. However the app often provides significant discounts as the company is trying to attract more students.</p>
<p>I love this site and it&#8217;s one of my to-go every time I want to learn something new.</p>

<h3>4. Coursera</h3>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-907042"" src=""https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/coursera.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1747"" height=""1240"" srcset=""https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/coursera.jpg 1747w https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/coursera-1536x1090.jpg 1536w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1747px) 100vw 1747px"" /></p>
<p>Coursera is another excellent tool for learning especially if you are looking to get a certificate and use it to apply for a job. Unlike Udemy Coursera is more focused on academics you can get a certificate that attests that you&#8217;ve completed the course.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not surprising that Coursera offers such accreditation since two professors from Stanford University created the platform. Currently the site claims to have served 70 million students in 2020 with a year-over-year growth of 60% which is a pretty impressive number.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_1623_1"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1623_1');"">[1]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1623_1""></span></p>
<p>What I love about Coursera is that they provide a subscription model that gives you access to all courses with certificates included. Of course so they are perfectly designed for effective learning from home or on the go.</p>

<h3>5. The Great Courses</h3>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-907043"" src=""https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/the-great-courses.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1747"" height=""1240"" srcset=""https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/the-great-courses.jpg 1747w https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/the-great-courses-1536x1090.jpg 1536w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1747px) 100vw 1747px"" /></p>
<p>If Coursera is geared mainly toward professional skills The Great Courses offers a broader variety of classes for almost every hobby you can think of. The Great Courses has an upgrade program called The Great Courses Plus which offers a subscription model that gives unlimited access to their rich content.</p>
<p>One great thing about The Great Courses is that they have professionally designed video courses led by some of the world&#8217;s best instructors and masters of each field. In addition to having a user-friendly interface The Great Courses also integrates directly into the Roku TV player and is also available on Amazon Kindle.</p>

<h2>Retaining Information &#8211; Long-Term Learning</h2>
<p>Retaining information is a critical part of learning. If you go through dozens of courses and read hundreds of books—although it&#8217;s good for you—it won&#8217;t be as good if you can&#8217;t retain most of it.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that retaining doesn&#8217;t mean blindly memorizing everything you read or hear. It means organizing the essential aspects of what you learn in a way that makes it easy to search and access when you need it.</p>
<p>That is why it&#8217;s important to have a system in place that is always at your fingertips and allows you to accumulate and create your personal learning database. Such tools for learning will organize and logically connect all the bits and pieces of your education. At a later time you&#8217;ll be able to retrieve the information and use it effectively.</p>
<h3>6. Anki</h3>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-907044"" src=""https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/anki.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1747"" height=""1240"" srcset=""https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/anki.jpg 1747w https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/anki-1536x1090.jpg 1536w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1747px) 100vw 1747px"" /></p>
<p>Anki is a tool that will help you remember what you learn and retain information with more precision and for a longer time. It&#8217;s a study method that mimics that of paper flashcards but its creators designed it to be more efficient than other traditional learning methods.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that the system adapts to your current level and adjusts your learning accordingly. So let&#8217;s say you are learning a new language and you go through a set of flashcards. The app registers the answers you know and you won&#8217;t get those question cards again for two weeks. Those that you don&#8217;t know at all will appear again tomorrow.</p>
<p>By focusing on the power of repetition but avoiding things you already know well you will learn and retain information highly efficiently.</p>
<p>One of the best things about Anki? It&#8217;s free. The second best thing? You can find it as a download for both Windows and Mac and also on mobile devices.</p>
<p>Anki is an excellent tool for learning that will improve your memory and save you lots of time.</p>

<p>Quizlet is another app that aims to help you retain information. It&#8217;s a study aid that turns a simplistic flashcard system into a full-fledged learning system through its intelligent features.</p>
<p>Quizlet is a perfect tool for learning at home at your own pace. The AI features built in the app allow it to adapt your learning path over time by targeting those areas where you struggle and limiting the recycling of information you&#8217;ve already got a good grip on.</p>
<p>At first sight it might look like this app is limited to K-12 students. Still it&#8217;s very well suited for advanced learners including university students and professionals who want to sharpen their knowledge and skills.</p>

<h2>Archiving and Maintaining Your Knowledge Base</h2>
<p>No matter how good your memory is you cannot rely exclusively on it especially when your goal is to optimize your efficiency. That&#8217;s why you must add a robust system to your learning process that allows you to store what you learn and access it quickly when you need it.</p>
<p>The goal here is to have the notes from your courses and labeled so that you can retrieve them with a few clicks.</p>
<h3>8. Diigo</h3>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-907046"" src=""https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/diigo.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1747"" height=""1240"" srcset=""https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/diigo.jpg 1747w https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/diigo-1536x1090.jpg 1536w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1747px) 100vw 1747px"" /></p>
<p>Diigo is a beautiful addition to your tools for learning arsenal. As the time you spend online grows the chances you encounter interesting information increases as well.</p>
<p>There are opportunities to learn all around you but often they fly right by due to the sheer volume and speed of information—but not if you use a tool like Diigo.</p>
<p>Diigo is a personal information management and organization system that allows you to bookmark and archive any information you encounter on the web. You capture data on the go and you put it in your learning queue for later.</p>

<h3>9. Evernote</h3>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-907047"" src=""https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/evernote.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1747"" height=""1240"" srcset=""https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/evernote.jpg 1747w https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/evernote-1536x1090.jpg 1536w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1747px) 100vw 1747px"" /></p>
<p>Evernote is one of the veteran apps in the note-taking universe. It started in the early 2000s and was among the first companies to fully embrace mobile integration and cross-device synchronization.</p>
<p>There are similarities between Diigo and Evernote but the main difference is that Diigo is focused on collecting content whereas Evernote also allows users to create content.</p>
<p>You can take notes using their intuitive WYSIWYG editor and share and organize them in folders I believe Evernote is a crucial app to use if you want to become more efficient in your learning. Their apps allow you to take photo snapshots and archive them. If the scan can be converted to text then it is also indexed for easy search.</p>

<h3>10. Notion</h3>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-907048"" src=""https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/notion.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1747"" height=""1240"" srcset=""https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/notion.jpg 1747w https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/notion-1536x1090.jpg 1536w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1747px) 100vw 1747px"" /></p>
<p>Notion is a lot more than a note-taking app. It&#8217;s an entire system that you can set up as your personal learning hub. At its core Notion is a database that you can design to hold your notes intuitively and provides you easy access to your information.</p>
<p>Because it works with any media you can save video webinars or entire books or PDFs. There&#8217;s almost nothing that you can&#8217;t do in Notion and it almost sounds too good to be true.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a catch of course. Notion has a little bit of a learning curve and most people don&#8217;t find it easy to use from the get-go. But with a bit of practice and a little time I think it will do wonders for your learning and soon you will drop all other methods of collecting knowledge.</p>

<h2>Bonus: Brain Training &#8211; Keeping Yourself Sharp</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s one more category I want to add as a bonus. Keeping your mind fresh and active is vital no matter where you are in life. Your brain is like a muscle and when it comes to learning consistency over intensity is critical.</p>
<p>Small bursts of brain activation over time will improve your creative thinking and will make your brain more effective at learning. So I consider these apps an integral part of your tools for learning arsenal.</p>
<p>Because we are looking at improving your effectiveness these tools are perfect because they provide small lessons and exercises that can be practice anytime and won&#8217;t take long. You might find yourself opening these apps while waiting in a long line at the grocery store or while waiting to see your doctor.</p>
<p>Overall they provide you with a quick and effective way to sharpen your brain which will improve your ability to learn and retain information over time.</p>
<p>Here are three excellent brain training apps to help you boost your learning.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elevate</strong> (<a href=""https://elevateapp.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Website</a> | <a href=""https://apps.apple.com/us/app/elevate-brain-training/id875063456"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Apple iOS</a> | <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?hl=en_US&amp;id=com.wonder"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Android</a>)</li>

</ul>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Learning is not a requirement but a responsibility. The idea that you complete your learning during school and then life follows is antiquated and we need to change that mindset for good.</p>
<p>Every one of us has room to grow and when learning falls at the bottom of our priority list you will plateau sooner or later. Only by allocating deliberate <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/10-ways-improve-your-time-management-skills.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">time for learning</a> and showing up every day will you be able to grow and lead a happier and fulfilled life.</p>
<p>When you learn on your own at home the danger is falling prey to procrastination or lacking direction. That is why having the right tools for learning at your disposal is so critical. They will improve your efficiency and help you track your progress these tools for learning are just the beginning. I urge you never to stop questioning your status quo and constantly asking yourself &#8220;what else can I learn? Where else can I find information that is easy to get and will help me and my life?&#8221;</p>
<p>Happy learning!</p>

<p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.lifehack.org/906011/how-to-fix-sleep-schedule"">How to Fix Your Sleep Schedule And Feel More Well-Rested</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.lifehack.org"">Lifehack</a>.</p> <p>“I try to sleep early but I can’t fall asleep because my mind keeps racing.” “I wake up at 2 am and can’t go back to sleep.” “I’m so busy I can only get 5 hours of sleep a night.”</p>
<p>Recognizable?</p>
<p>Many people are looking for ways on how to fix their sleep schedules. It&#8217;s a hot topic—and it should be.</p>
<p>One study showed that not sleeping enough is basically like being drunk. When they measured the accuracy in shooting a target in the military after sleeping a certain amount of hours they found that men who slept for more than 7 hours had an accuracy of 98%. For those who slept 6 hours the accuracy dropped to 50%. That’s almost a 50% drop!</p>
<p>But it gets worse: those who slept for 5 hours had an accuracy of only 23% and those who slept for less than 5 hours had an accuracy of 13%. Yes not sleeping enough is basically like being drunk!<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_2504_1"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_2504_1');"">[1]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2504_1""></span></p>
<p>Sleep doesn’t only influence your accuracy but it also affects other areas of your life:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emotionally: you get cranky or even depressed</li>
<li>Mentally: you can’t focus well or remember important information</li>
<li>Somatically: your body feels achy and sore</li>
<li>Physically: your cells can’t repair the inflammation in your body goes up and all kinds of health issues arise</li>
</ul>
<p>So why is it important to not only sleep enough but also have a steady sleep schedule?</p>
<p>Your body needs a rhythm. The wake-sleep cycle is also called the circadian rhythm. It’s a constant play between cortisol and melatonin. Cortisol is your get-up-and-go hormone in the morning. It gets activated with sunlight. Melatonin is your sleep hormone and can only increase when cortisol goes down in the evening.</p>
<p>I know you thought of stress when I mentioned cortisol and you’re right about that. Cortisol goes up when we are stressed have an infection or inflammation in the body and when we are digesting food.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_2504_2"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_2504_2');"">[2]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2504_2""></span> If you’re that person who wakes up at 2 am and can’t fall back asleep that is your cortisol speaking. It’s too high and melatonin is too low.</p>
<p>In this article I&#8217;ll share with you five tips on how to fix your sleep schedule.</p>
<h2>1. Define Your Sleep Rhythm</h2>
<p>Everybody is different. Find what works for you. Do you feel most rested when you sleep early and wake up early? Or are you more of an evening person who’s more productive when sleeping late and waking up late?</p>
<p>Listen to your body and pick your sleep schedule. Don’t worry if you’re not sure about it. Look at it as an experiment. Pick your time of going to bed and your time of waking up and test it out for a week. Doesn’t feel right? Switch it up until you find a rhythm that feels good.</p>
<p>Need some extra support to fix your schedule? Take the <a href=""https://thepowerofwhenquiz.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Power of When Quiz</a> and find your Sleep Chronotype.</p>
<p>There’s an interesting 15-minute video training at the end to know more about the effects on your sleep when you exercise etc.</p>
<h2>2. Create a 5-Minute Morning Routine</h2>
<p>Five minutes is enough to tell your body that it’s time to wake up and to prime your brain to be in the right mood and to feel positive. In those first five minutes of the day your brain wakes up and switches from a subconscious state to a conscious state. This basically means that any input you get and anything you do in those first five minutes will set the tone for the rest of your day.</p>
<p>If you wake up in a rush you turn on your WiFi right away and check your messages you think of everything you still need to do and run out the door those influence the rest of your day. Your mind feels scattered you don’t feel fully present and your stress levels go through the roof.</p>
<p>Find a <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/768258/morning-routine-to-make-your-day"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">mini-morning routine</a> so that you can wake up feeling more well-rested and in control of your day. Create a set of habits that you can repeat every day so your brain doesn’t need to make decisions yet like waking up and drinking a glass of water with lime thinking of three things you’re grateful for looking out the window with a cup of tea or going for a quick walk to get some sunlight in. Soaking up that sunlight in the morning will even help you fall asleep faster at night.</p>
<h2>3. Calm Down Your Brain in the Evening</h2>
<p>Another tip on how to fix your sleep schedule is learning how to calm down your brain in the evening. It’s important to prepare your body and your brain for sleep.</p>
<p>We want our cortisol levels to go down so that melatonin can go up. If we’re still receiving lots of input from social media or we’re engaging in a heated discussion our brain will still be up-and-running processing the information and emotions swirling around instead of slowing down for a good night’s sleep.</p>
<p>How can you create an evening wind-down of one or preferably two hours before going to sleep where you completely disconnect and relax your system?</p>
<p>First of all focus on output instead of input. We are living in such an input society where we keep consuming more information and new impulses through the media. We’re making our brains work overtime answering more messages. What kind of output can you focus on?</p>
<p>Whether it’s journaling find something you can do that can either come out of you instead of putting new things in or something that can give your brain a break by doing something more physical like stretching <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/why-electronics-dont-belong-your-bedroom.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">don’t watch any screens</a>. The blue light from your phone or laptop screen will block melatonin production. If you do need to watch a screen install a blue light filter. This will create a red glow on your screen in the evenings so that your eyes can rest and melatonin doesn’t get blocked. Depending on your device and system you can find many great free options.</p>
<p>Thirdly don’t eat or drink anything before going to sleep. Like mentioned before cortisol goes up when you’re digesting food. Try not to eat or drink anything at least two hours before bedtime. If you do feel hungry go for good protein options instead of carbohydrates. There are even foods with protein that stimulate the production of melatonin like almonds. If you do want to drink something go for some relaxing tea like chamomile or valerian.</p>
<h2>4. Upgrade Your Bedroom</h2>
<p>Make sure your bedroom is super sleep-friendly with a good quality mattress good blinds to block the light from interrupting your sleep and make sure it’s not too humid or hot. It’s worth investing in the greatest sleep circumstances. You spend about 33 years of your life in bed!<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_2504_3"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_2504_3');"">[3]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2504_3""></span></p>
<p>Use your bed only for sleeping and making love. We need to train our brains in our favor. If we tell our brains that the bed is only a place for sleep it will respect that and help us fall asleep faster.</p>
<p>On the other hand if you sometimes use your laptop in the bed scroll your social media feed your brain will think it can start doing other mental activities when you’re actually just trying to sleep.</p>
<p>If you can’t fall asleep and your brain is racing read a book in the living room drink some lavender tea or diffuse some lavender oil and try again. Don’t just twist and turn in the bed hoping you’ll fall asleep soon. To train our brains to fall asleep faster and respect our sleep schedule it’s better to get up and then come back to try again.</p>
<h2>5. Bring Down Your Stress Levels</h2>
<p>Last but not least on how to fix your sleep schedule you need to keep your cortisol levels low. It can peak for short moments and that is totally natural. But when you are chronically stressed and your cortisol is high all the time the effects on your health can be detrimental.</p>
<p>This is why it’s so important to work on your stress management skills. Which tools do you have in your toolbox already that you can use? What gives you that feeling of calmness? How can you do more of that especially during your evening wind down?</p>
<p>You can either try different stress management practices at home or get help from a stress coach:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/317334/5-breathing-exercises-relax-your-mind"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Breathing exercises</a></li>
<li>Practicing gratitude</li>
<li>Journaling</li>
<li>Reframing problems</li>
<li>Exercising</li>
<li>Meditating</li>
<li>Connecting with positive people</li>
<li>Laughing</li>
<li>Listening to relaxing music</li>
<li>Doing yoga</li>
</ul>
<p>Find out what fits you as a person and what you can easily implement even when life gets in the way. We all fall off the wagon and forget about these practices now and then. It’s never too late to get back on that horse and restart a regular relaxation practice.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Sleep is that golden chain that ties health and our bodies together.&#8221;—Thomas Dekker</p></blockquote>
<p>High levels of cortisol don’t always come from mental stress. It can be physical stress too when your immune system is fighting against bacteria or certain foods. If you feel that might be the case it is worth investigating more into your physical health and finding where the inflammation in your body is coming from.</p>
<p>And with that I’m wishing you a lovely evening and a great night’s rest!</p>

<p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.lifehack.org/900275/fake-people"">How To Spot Fake People (And Ways To Deal With Them)</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.lifehack.org"">Lifehack</a>.</p> <p>They say we are the average of the five persons we spend the most time with. For a minute consider the people around you. Are they truly who your &#8220;tribe&#8221; should be or who you aspire to become in the future? Are they really genuine people who want to see you succeed? Or are they fake people who don&#8217;t really want to see you happy?</p>
<p>In this article I&#8217;ll review why it is important to surround yourself with genuine individuals—the ones who care bring something to our table who leave all fakeness behind.</p>

<h2>How to Spot Fake People?</h2>
<p>When you&#8217;ve been working in the helping professions for a while spotting fake people gets a bit easier. There are some very clear signs that the person you are looking at is hiding something or simply wanting to get somewhere. Most often there is a secondary gain—perhaps attention or even a promotion.</p>
<p>Whatever it is you&#8217;re better off working their true agenda and staying the hell away. Here are some things you should look out for to help spot fake people.</p>
<h4>1. Full of Themselves</h4>
<p>Fake people like to show off. They love looking at themselves in the mirror. They collect photos and videos of every single achievement they had and every part of their body and claim to be the &#8220;best at what they do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of these people are actually not that good in real life. But they act like they are and ensure that they appear better than the next person. The issue for you is that you may find yourself always feeling &#8220;beneath&#8221; them and irritated at their constant need to be in the spotlight.</p>
<h4>2. Murky in Expressing Their Emotions</h4>
<p>Have you ever tried having a deep and meaningful conversation with a fake person? It&#8217;s almost impossible. It&#8217;s because they have limited emotional intelligence and don&#8217;t know how they truly feel deep down—and partly because they don&#8217;t want to have their true emotions exposed no matter how normal these might be.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s much harder to say &#8220;I&#8217;m the best at what I do&#8221; while simultaneously sharing &#8220;average&#8221; emotions with &#8220;equal&#8221; people.</p>
<h4>3. Zero Self-Reflection</h4>
<p>To grow we must accept feedback from others. We must be open to our strengths and to our weaknesses. We must accept that we all come in different shapes and can always improve.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/the-power-self-reflection-ten-questions-you-should-ask-yourself.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Self-reflection</a> requires us to think and learn from our mistakes. But to do that we have to be able to adopt a level of genuineness and depth that fake people don&#8217;t routinely have. A fake person generally never apologizes it is often followed with a &#8220;but&#8221; in the next breath.</p>
<h4>4. Unrealistic Perceptions</h4>
<p>Fake people most often have an unrealistic perception of the world—things that they want to portray to others (pseudo achievements or a made-up sense of happiness) or simply how they genuinely regard life outside themselves.</p>
<p>A lot of fake people hide pain and other underlying reasons in their behavior. This could explain why they can&#8217;t be authentic and/or have difficulties seeing their environment for the way it objectively is (both good and bad).</p>
<h4>5. Love Attention</h4>
<p>As I mentioned earlier the biggest sign that something isn&#8217;t quite right with someone&#8217;s behavior can be established by how much they love attention. Are you being interrupted every time you speak by someone who wants to make sure that the spotlight gets reverted back to them? Is the focus always on them no matter the topic? If yes you&#8217;re probably dealing with a fake person.</p>
<h4>6. People Pleaser</h4>
<p>Appreciation feels nice but having everyone like you is even better. While it is completely unrealistic for most people to please everyone all the time fake people seem to always say yes in pursuit of constant approval.</p>
<p>Now this is a problem for two reasons. Firstly these people are simply saying yes to things for their own satisfaction. Secondly they often end up changing their minds or retracting their offer for one reason or another (&#8220;I would have loved to but my grandmother suddenly fell ill.&#8221;) leaving you in the lurch for the 100th time this year.</p>
<h4>7. Sarcasm and Cynicism</h4>
<p>Behind the chronic pasted smile fake people are well known for brewing resentment or anger. This is because they are often unhappy. Sarcasm and cynicism are well known to act as a defense mechanism sometimes even a diversion—anything so they can remain feeling on top of the world whether it is through boosting themselves or bringing people down.</p>
<h4>8. Crappy friend</h4>
<p>Fake people are bad friends. They don&#8217;t listen to you and whatever news you might have to share. In fact you might find yourself migrating away from them when you have exciting or bad news to share knowing that it will always end up one way—their way. In addition you might find that they&#8217;re not available when you truly need them or worse cancel plans at the last minute.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not unusual to hear that a fake person talks constantly behind people&#8217;s backs. Let&#8217;s be honest if they do it to others they&#8217;re doing it to you too. If your &#8220;friend&#8221; makes you feel bad constantly they&#8217;re not achieving their purpose and they&#8217;re simply not a good person to have around.</p>
<p>The sooner you learn to spot these fake people the sooner you can meet meaningful individuals again.</p>
<h2>How to Cope With Fake People Moving Forward?</h2>
<p>It is important to remind yourself that <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/11-warning-signs-that-youre-settling-for-less-life.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">you deserve more</a> than what you&#8217;re getting. You are worthy and just as important as the next person.</p>
<p>There are many ways to manage fake people. Here are some tips on how to deal with them.</p>
<h4>1. Boundaries</h4>
<p>Keep your boundaries very clear. As explained in the book <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082J8KXVF?tag=s7621-20"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Unlock Your Resilience</a> boundaries are what keep you sane when the world tries to suffocate you. When fake people become emotional vampires make sure to keep your distances and simply replace them with more valuable interactions.</p>
<h4>2. Don&#8217;t Take Their Behavior Personally</h4>
<p>Sadly they most likely have behaved this way before they knew you and will continue much longer after you have moved on. It isn&#8217;t about you. It is about their inner need to meet a void that you are not responsible for. And in all honesty unless you are a trained professional you are unlikely to improve it anyway.</p>
<h4>3. Be Upfront and Honest About How You Feel</h4>
<p>If your &#8220;friend&#8221; has been hurtful or engaged in behaviors you struggle with but let them know that they are affecting you. If it works you&#8217;ll feel better and when you&#8217;re ready to move on you&#8217;ll know you tried to reach out. Your conscience is clear.</p>
<h4>4. Ask for Advice</h4>
<p>If you&#8217;re unsure about what you&#8217;re seeing or feeling ask for advice. Perhaps a relative or a colleague might have some input as to whether you are overreacting or seeing some genuine concerns.</p>
<p>Now don&#8217;t confuse asking for advice with gossiping behind the fake person&#8217;s back because you don&#8217;t want to stoop down to their level. However a little reminder as to how to stay on your own wellness track can never hurt.</p>
<h4>5. Dig Deeper</h4>
<p>Now I offer with caution. If you are emotionally strong guaranteed you won&#8217;t get sucked into it and have the skills to manage perhaps you could dig into the reasons a fake person is acting the way they do.</p>
<p>Have they suffered recent trauma? Have they been rejected all their lives? Is their <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/565816/low-self-esteem"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">self-esteem</a> so low that they must resort to making themselves feel good in any way they can? Sometimes having an understanding of a person&#8217;s behavior can help in processing it.</p>
<h4>6. Practice Self-Care!</h4>
<p>Clearly putting some distance between the fake person and yourself is probably the way to go. However it takes time to get there. In the meantime make sure to practice self-care and compensate with lots of positives!</p>
<p>Self-care can be as simple as taking a hot shower after talking to them or declining an invitation when you&#8217;re not feeling up to the challenge.</p>
<p>Spotting fake people isn&#8217;t too hard. They generally glow with wanna-be vibes. However there are reasons as to why they are like this. Calling their behavior might be the first step. Providing them with support might be the second. But if these don&#8217;t work it&#8217;s time to stay away and surround yourself with the positivity that you deserve.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Remember that life is a rollercoaster. It has good moments and moments you wouldn&#8217;t change for the world. So look around and make sure that you take the time to choose the right people to share it all with.</p>
<p>We are the average of the five people we spend the most time with so take a good look around and choose wisely!</p>

<p>2.“For what reasons can it not be you?”</p>
<p>3. Ditch the guilt. Guilt is one emotion that never leads to good things. Remove the guilt and you can move on.</p>
<p>4. At this moment in time you are everything you need to be everything you want to be.</p>
<p>5. The day you realize how amazing you are is the day the world had better stand back.</p>
<p>6. You need to know on a good day how to look after yourself and your success on a bad day. How will you ensure you take action on this advice?</p>
<p>7. Your mind can be a power for your success or power for your failure. Choose wisely the quality of your thoughts. How will you monitor the quality of your thoughts and ensure they work for you?</p>
<p>8. Even the long-distance swimmer does not achieve success on their own—who is in your team toward success?</p>
<p>9. How do you keep going? Look how far you have come. What helped you get this far? Who helped you get this far? How will they feature in the future to ensure you succeed and overcome?</p>
<p>10. Life is easier with love—swap the word &#8220;life&#8221; for success achieving your goals. Now ask yourself—where do you get your love from? The first place should be you.</p>
<p>11.</p>

<p>12. Learn the science of who you are. This is powerful knowledge that will empower you to move forward no matter what you face or want to achieve.</p>
<p>13. Trying to copy the route to success that someone else took doesn&#8217;t guarantee you success. You have to honor your values and experiences.</p>
<p>14. What you think is possible is absolutely correct. Challenge what you think.</p>
<p>15. For one month ask this question every day and score yourself out of 10 (10 being exceptional 1 being lousy). Write the answer in your phone’s calendar: How successful do I feel? You can swap successful for happy etc. Notice what affects your score.</p>
<p>16. Remember that everything changes. The hibernating tree looks dead but will return in the spring rejuvenated. This is essential knowledge for good times and bad. In bad times it reminds you to keep going it reminds you to be grateful and keep looking to learn and grow. (Just like that tree!)</p>
<p>17. What’s stopping you? Is it a perception or a fact? Either way you can do something about it even if it is just to change the thoughts attached to the thing that is stopping you. Nothing can have power over you unless you let it.</p>
<p>18. Steer clear of negative people and views. It’s all too easy to get dragged into other people’s negativity. Understand how negative news and people impact you. If you can’t find ways to keep that negativity away then step away metaphorically and physically. Your success will appreciate it.</p>
<p>19. The quality of your thoughts and feelings impacts your actions and results. Everything you can see started as a thought. So “are my thoughts enabling me or disabling me?” Are my thoughts “moving me forward or holding me back?”</p>
<p>20.</p>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-906990"" src=""https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/quote20.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1747"" height=""1240"" srcset=""https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/quote20.jpg 1747w https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/quote20-1536x1090.jpg 1536w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1747px) 100vw 1747px"" /></p>
<p>21. Sad isn’t bad. We get all the emotions not just the good ones. So don’t push those emotions away. Take yourself through this process:</p>
<ol>
<li>For what reason am I feeling this?</li>
<li>What does it tell me about my life right now?</li>
<li>What does it tell me about my actions and results right now?</li>
<li>What would I like to feel instead?</li>
<li>What would this do for me?</li>
<li>How will I get myself there?</li>
</ol>
<p>Take yourself through the process and own all emotions.</p>
<p>23. The one thing you can control is what you think.</p>
<p>24. On this planet your job is not to fit in. Your job is to shine. Stand out. Speak up and be the unique individual you are meant to be. It’s the quickest way to lasting success.</p>
<p>25. Words can only have power if you let them. Good words bad words. Happy words. Successful words. Which words are you giving the most power to?</p>
<p>26. If you want to achieve more you’ve got to assume you are worth it. Are you worth it? (The answer is “Yes with bells on are you worth it!”) And if you don’t believe this then what will you do to rocket your confidence?</p>
<p>27. While many fear failure it is a gift in disguise. It tells you what not to repeat it tells you what didn&#8217;t work and it moves you forward to what you want to achieve. Don&#8217;t berate and hate your failures. They are driving you forward to your success.</p>
<p>28. It&#8217;s hard to achieve great things if you don&#8217;t have a plan. It&#8217;s like wanting to go on holiday and just rocking up at the airport on the off chance you can get on a plane going to your dream destination. Plan what you want and create a <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/844018/action-plan"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">plan of action</a> to help get you there. It&#8217;s easier and faster.</p>
<p>29. Everyone needs someone in their corner—someone to cheerlead and wipe your grazed knees and remind you that you can. Who is in your corner? You can add me to that list.</p>
<p>30. Social media is supposed to be good for you. It&#8217;s supposed to connect you to like-minded people and loved like you are part of something truly special. If it doesn&#8217;t step away from the negative groups and look for the things that inspire you—yes you can include cute funny cat videos!</p>
<p>31. Action! The key to success is knowing when to <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/878426/take-action"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">take action</a> and when to stop.</p>
<p>32. When someone tells you that one book changed their life that doesn&#8217;t mean it will work for you. If it doesn&#8217;t work for you the book failed. The book was the wrong book for you. Don&#8217;t stop reading. Just look for the right fit for you.</p>
<p>33. Just as all people are different with different beliefs and aspirations so is the journey to success and progress different for all. Expecting to move forward and get what you want by copying others is not the same as looking up to the right role models.</p>
<p>34. Your success and progress in life are not dependent on luck. It is dependent on self-belief. Check your levels.</p>
<p>35. It is not beneficial to apologize for what you need in life. It takes away its value to you. If you need it own it!</p>
<p>35. It&#8217;s a good idea to know the difference between enjoying the breeze and being pushed around by life.</p>
<p>36. Motivation. If you are needing some don&#8217;t look for it on a bad day. Look for it on a good day. Music and dancing can be the key to kick you back into action and results.</p>
<p>37. Black and white. Nothing in life is black and white and yet people want things to be like this—to be &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no.&#8221; Final. Getting what you want in life rarely is so finite. You need to be able to accept a bit of grey area in life to get more of what you want. Being someone reliant on absolutes makes it so much harder.</p>
<p>38. The racing driver does not concentrate on the brick wall at the side of the road as they race at 100+ miles per hour. They concentrate on the bend and success. If you don&#8217;t want to hit the wall concentrate on the track.</p>
<p>39.</p>
<p><img loading=""lazy"" class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-906991"" src=""https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/quote39.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1747"" height=""1240"" srcset=""https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/quote39.jpg 1747w https://cdn.lifehack.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/quote39-1536x1090.jpg 1536w"" sizes=""(max-width: 1747px) 100vw 1747px"" /></p>
<p>40. Choosing to stop thinking about something because it upsets you or angers you doesn&#8217;t mean your brain is not trying to process how you feel. You need to make space to process those negatives so that you are back in the flow and doing what you excel at.</p>
<p>41. Being reactive instead of proactive stops you from moving forward. What needs to change?</p>
<p>42. Is your fundamental desire for what you want rooted in love? If it is not question how powerful your <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/7-great-ways-how-overcome-loss-motivation.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">motivation</a> is.</p>
<p>43. When you really need motivation and encouragement and want to reach out to others did you know that helping others also helps you? Altruism is a fast way to feeling good and doing good and it helps you to feel motivated too.</p>
<p>44. Think back to a time that you overcome adversity or kept going when you really didn&#8217;t want to. What skills do you notice? What were you telling yourself? What did you learn about who you are? How will you use that knowledge moving forward?</p>
<p>45. &#8220;Don&#8217;t &#8221; and &#8220;Can&#8217;t&#8221; all have power. One holds power over you and one takes ownership. Which one are you using? Can you tell the difference?</p>
<p>46. Whoever said words had no power had never met a powerful coach! Words can be the building blocks to overcoming anything and getting what you want in life. So what words are you allowing in your head? How do you word your goals and ambitions?</p>
<p>47. Feel the fear and do it anyway. Is that a good idea with a starving tiger in the same room? Will you stick around and have a chat about how you wish to overcome the fear of the tiger or will you take action? Move so far away from your fear that it doesn&#8217;t exist? And get an expert to help you deal with the tiger? Analogies like this help you see how fear is allowed to stick around and how to get rid of it permanently.</p>
<p>48. Believing that &#8220;it is what it is&#8221; is a great way to stay stuck. If you choose to believe there is a better way you will find it.</p>
<p>49. Being honest about what you face is not moaning it&#8217;s reaching out. If people see this as moaning they are the wrong people to be turning to. Maybe it&#8217;s time to upgrade your network of friends and people you can trust.</p>
<p>50. Look in the mirror who do you see? Someone you love or someone you loathe? Both will impact your success.</p>
<h2>So What Now?</h2>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve read 50 quotes and words of encouragement which ones got you thinking and which ones can&#8217;t you remember reading? Some will really resonate with you and make you question how you think and how you act. Take just three minutes to decide which words of encouragement are going to be your mantra for the coming week.</p>
<p>Take the time at the end of the week to review and reflect. Did you see any improvement? Did you really remember to hold on to this quote with the power to encourage you forward to great things?</p>
<p>If not stop in your tracks and consider how much you believe in yourself. The most powerful words in the world can&#8217;t work on the person who already believes that they are good enough or have failed.</p>

<p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.lifehack.org/905612/what-is-decision-fatigue"">What Is Decision Fatigue And How To Combat It</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.lifehack.org"">Lifehack</a>.</p> <p>How often have you had the experience of needing to make tough decisions that pull you in different directions? You go round and round in circles and you either flip a coin or make a snap decision because you&#8217;re just too tired to think anymore. Or maybe you simply put off reaching a decision indefinitely which is sometimes easier than making a tough call.</p>
<p>Can you relate to this currently? If so then you&#8217;re likely suffering from decision fatigue. Poor decisions are made not because of incapability but because arriving at one or more choices takes its toll—to the extent that it severely weakens our mental energy.</p>
<p>Now that we know what decision fatigue is let&#8217;s explore the primary ways to combat it to enable a stronger mental state coupled with better decision-making.</p>
<h2>1. Identify and Make the Most Important Decisions First</h2>
<p>If you have a busy personal or work life where many tricky decisions are on the table every day this can easily and quickly become overwhelming. In this instance create mental space by initially laying out all situations and challenges requiring a decision. Use a basic software tool or write them down on paper—a notepad file or word document is sufficient.</p>
<p>Once you have your complete list carefully pick out the most important items needing a conclusion sooner rather than later. Be mindful of the fact that you can&#8217;t treat everything as urgent or requiring immediate attention. There have to be some things that are more important than others!</p>
<h3>Prioritize and Declare the Appropriate Options</h3>
<p>Equipped with your most pressing items awaiting decisions add another layer of scrutiny by <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/810807/prioritizing-work-and-life"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">prioritizing them</a> even further. The result should allow you to identify your most urgent and important tasks without any conflicting priorities.</p>
<p>The last part of this exercise is to highlight all of the options to consider for your most important decision and work through them one by one. With the visual representation of options and most critical decisions out the way first you&#8217;ll be able to think more clearly and prevent decision fatigue from subtly kicking in.</p>
<h2>2. Implement Daily Routines to Automate Less Important Decisions</h2>
<p>&#8220;Shall I have a healthy lunch today?&#8221; &#8220;Should I wake up earlier tomorrow?&#8221; &#8220;What time should I prepare dinner tonight?&#8221;</p>
<p>As trivial as these questions appear to be each one still requires a decision. Stack them on top of other straightforward everyday questions in addition to more significant ones and things can start to add up unpleasantly.</p>
<p>Small or less important decisions can eat away at your time and productivity. When many other decisions need to be made in parallel it can lead to decision fatigue. However there&#8217;s a method to avoid this. It involves streamlining aspects of your life by automating repetitive decisions and this drives the ability to make better decisions overall.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_2759_1"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_2759_1');"">[1]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2759_1""></span></p>
<h3>It&#8217;s Your Routine—Control It to Create Time for Other Activities</h3>
<p>Instead of having to decide multiple times per week if you should have a healthy lunch create a <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/677367/powerful-daily-routine"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">daily routine</a> sufficiently ahead of time by dictating what healthy food you&#8217;ll eat for lunch every day. In doing so you&#8217;re putting that particular decision on autopilot. Your predefined routine commits you to a decision immediately and without hesitation.</p>
<p>Invest time into highlighting all of the trivial and recurring situations requiring decisions daily then implement a collective routine that relieves the need for you to give them much thought (if any thought at all).</p>
<h2>3. Put a Time Limit on Every Decision</h2>
<p>Making complex or big decisions increases the risk of draining your energy. This is especially true if you struggle with the fear of making the wrong decision. The doubt and worry bouncing around inside continuously are enough for the majority of people to become fed up and exhausted.</p>
<p>To make good decisions you need to be in the right position to act. A tactic to deploy is to essentially force yourself to act by setting a time limit on your decision-making process. What might seem a little daunting—given that it can create a sense of added pressure—actually provides clarity on when you need to conclude since you can see the end in sight.</p>
<h3>Grow in Confidence by Reducing Hesitation</h3>
<p>After making the decision it&#8217;s time to move on. You&#8217;ll feel good and <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/683919/how-to-be-more-confident-the-definitive-step-by-step-guide"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">build self-confidence</a> knowing that you didn&#8217;t linger on the choices available.</p>
<p>Only consider revisiting a previous decision if something unexpected occurs that impacts it. If that&#8217;s the case then follow the same process by ensuring you make the revised decision before a new deadline.</p>
<h2>4. Seek Input From Other People—Don&#8217;t Decide Alone</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a time and place to make decisions alone it&#8217;s appropriate to involve others. If there&#8217;s any degree of struggle in reaching a verdict then seeking opinions from people in your network can lessen the mental burden of indecisiveness.</p>
<p>Do you feel comfortable seeking input from other people to help make decisions? Trust and feeling secure in your relationships are crucial to answer &#8220;yes&#8221; to this question.</p>
<h3>Explore the Thoughts of Others and Gain a Different Perspective</h3>
<p>An insecure business leader likely won&#8217;t trust their team(s) to help them make decisions. On the other hand an assured and secure business leader realizes they don&#8217;t &#8220;know it all.&#8221; Instead of going solo on all work-related decisions they install trust among their team and get the support required to arrive at the best possible decisions.</p>
<p>The ability to make a great decision can depend on the information related to it that&#8217;s at your disposal. When faced with a difficult choice don&#8217;t be afraid to lean on the relevant people for help. They can offer valid alternatives that are otherwise easy to overlook or hold the key to you making a well-informed decision.</p>
<h2>5. Simplify and Lower the Number of Available Options</h2>
<p>You&#8217;re standing in the store facing an aisle of more than 20 varieties of peanut butter. You have no idea which one to choose and although there are subtle differences they all look fairly similar. No doubt you&#8217;ve been in this situation at least once in the past (maybe with a substitute for peanut butter!).</p>
<p>This is a classic example of having too many choices—an event that makes you prone to decide to do nothing or waste time by continually pondering on which product to buy.</p>
<p>According to the psychological concept known as choice overload simply having too many options can be disruptive and overburdening causing decision fatigue.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_2759_2"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_2759_2');"">[2]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2759_2""></span> Using the example above you might make the easiest choice of avoiding any further thought which often results in the purchase of the wrong item.</p>
<h3>Extract Meaningful Information and Evaluate Options With a Binary Outcome</h3>
<p>To simplify and lower your range of options leverage the information available and extract what&#8217;s most important for you to make a decision. Is it the price? The protein content? Whether it has sustainable packaging or a combination of multiple details?</p>
<p>Keep a tight lid on having too many important components. Prioritize if necessary and implement a binary outcome (of &#8220;yes&#8221; or &#8220;no&#8221; / &#8220;true&#8221; or &#8220;false&#8221;) to help arrive at decisions earlier such as defining a limited price range that the product must fall within.</p>
<h2>6. Eliminate Unnecessary Distractions</h2>
<p>Arguably attention is the currency of the modern world. The ability to concentrate better than the next person can mean the difference between a successful student how can you improve your attention span to make better choices and avoid decision fatigue? There are many strategies and one of the most optimal ways is to eliminate distractions. Today the easiest distractions are a result of technology and the devices running it—all of which are at your fingertips 24/7.</p>
<h3>Create Extended Periods of Time to Increase Focus</h3>
<p>These distractions might be small or large but the broader issue is the frequency of them and they repeatedly cause a break in your focus. Dealing with this while trying to make the right decision can be mentally debilitating.</p>
<p>Technology distractions commonly relate to email push notifications from mobile apps and scrolling through social media feeds. Access to all of these technologies and tools must be limited to scheduled <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/881771/time-blocking"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">time blocks</a> (ideally using a calendar if it&#8217;s during a working day).</p>
<p>Switch off notifications entirely to all of the above to prevent distractions (where possible) when it&#8217;s not time to look at them. This enables you to think more deeply and focus for prolonged periods of time ultimately boosting the chances of making good decisions.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Decision fatigue is a real phenomenon that can deplete energy levels and increase stress. It can affect anyone who has to make decisions whether they are minor or major ones.</p>
<p>Overcoming decision fatigue needs patience and dedication. By applying the best practices discussed in this article you&#8217;ll be on the path to implement valuable changes. These changes will increase your productivity as well as drastically improve your consistency and ability to make the right choices.</p>

<p>If you are asking the question “how do I get over my anxiety?” then this article is for you. I’ve put together a list of my top strategies to help you get over your anxiety. These are the same strategies that have worked for many of my clients over the years and I think they can work for you too!</p>
<p><strong>Anxiety is as</strong> <strong>uneasiness or nervousness about an undetermined outcome</strong>. Sometimes this worry and uneasiness is quite excessive and goes from something that we can manage on our own to something for which we need professional help.  If your worry or apprehension includes panic attacks or compulsive behaviors consider reaching out to a therapist or a doctor for more professional help.</p>
<p>I like to think of anxiety as information—a sign that something is off in your life. It could be a global pandemic or the sign of a larger mental health issue.  Whatever it is it’s good to think this through and be asking the questions that will help you uncover the parts of your life that could use some adjusting.</p>
<p>Again consulting with a therapist or counselor even just for a brief period of time can help decipher some of these questions for you.  And if you want to give it a go on your own well that takes us to the first of my five tips on how to get over anxiety.</p>
<p>Here are 5 tips on how to get over anxiety and live a more fulfilling life.</p>
<h2>1. The Mighty Journal</h2>
<p>You will be amazed by the power of <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/journal-writing-5-smart-reasons-why-you-should-start-doing-today.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">journaling</a>—the path of self-discovery it can lead you down. The best part of journaling is that there is no right or wrong here. It is a private place where you can work through the stuff in your head and figure some things out.</p>
<p>There are lots of formats for journaling and I have personally changed my own approach several times depending on what was going on and what I was looking for.  It could be that narrative of your day or bullets with highlights or thoughts of the day.</p>
<p>To make the most out of your journaling I would encourage you to push yourself and go beyond a recount of the day&#8217;s events. What you really want here is to get into your thought process and understand the feelings behind the thoughts. Timelines can also be a great way to gain some understanding of relationships and the different events in your life. Again it is a matter of what works for you.</p>
<p>The pen truly is mightier than. . . the meds?!? My own little psych-mashup.</p>
<h2>2. Schedule Your Self-Care Time</h2>
<p>What are the ways you treat yourself? Life is busy and when life demands increase <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/the-5-step-guide-self-care-for-busy-people.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">self-care</a> is often one of the first things to fall by the wayside. But it is critical that you build in your “you time” because when stress levels increase so will anxiety.</p>
<p>If self-care is not something that you are accustomed to thinking about I listed some ideas for you to consider.  Keep in mind that if you schedule it with someone else it might help with accountability.</p>
<p>Think about working smaller chunks of time into the workweek and then something a little more extensive on the weekend or even the occasional weekend away.</p>
<p>Self-care ideas:<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_5785_2"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_5785_2');"">[2]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_5785_2""></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Take your lunchtime away from your desk and get outside for a walk or join a colleague for some casual chitchat.</li>
<li>Schedule a massage or trip to the spa/salon.</li>
<li>Watch a favorite movie or TV show either on your own or with your favorite person/people.</li>
<li>Work out inside or out—anything that gets your heart rate up.</li>
<li>Go on an evening or afternoon walk.</li>
<li>Tap into your creative outlet at home with your kids or on your own.  Play your favorite tunes and do your thing!</li>

<h2>3. Listen to Your Music</h2>
<p>Music speaks to our soul. It is a go-to for many of us when in need of a pick-me-up or just blowing off some steam. But sometimes and we don’t incorporate it into our life the way we once did—finding ourselves in a music deficient rut listening to the same boring stuff on the radio.</p>
<p>Let this be a reminder to explore the new music out there. Streaming services have revolutionized our access to music and have made it easier than ever before. Explore it and find your jam.</p>
<p>Additionally music therapy is a growing form of therapy built on the research that it helps decrease pain and—you guessed it—anxiety while also increasing mood and overall positivity.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_5785_3"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_5785_3');"">[3]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_5785_3""></span></p>
<p>Medical Doctors are using it more and more in operating rooms and incorporating it into their practices. If you subscribe to Spotify or Apple Music you can just type in “relaxing music” and you will be sure to find something that will do the trick bringing calm and focus into your life.  In my research for this article I came across some great ones. and they are now a part of my daily rotation.</p>
<h2>4. The Five Senses Exercise</h2>
<p>When we experience heightened anxiety I think of it as the physical energy rising from our feet to our head like a thermometer. Sometimes this energy can even bring us to a place where we feel disconnected from our bodies. The 5 senses exercise will help you reconnect yourself to your body and bring your anxiety levels down to a more manageable level.</p>
<p>The 5 senses exercise is a <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/878419/how-to-be-mindful"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">mindfulness</a> exercise where you connect your 5 senses to your present environment. This is a great way to ground yourself and bring your attention and your energy to the here and now.  What I love about this exercise is that it can be done anywhere and at any time. If you start to feel your anxiety creep up this could be a good strategy to center yourself and possibly ward off a panic attack or prolonged anxiety.</p>
<p>The process is simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start by taking a few deep breathes inhaling as you count to 3 and then exhaling as you count to 3.</li>
<li>Next identify 5 things you see 3 things you can touch and feel 2 things you can smell and 1 thing you can taste.</li>
<li>Take it in give yourself a few minutes.</li>
<li>Repeat if needed and carry on.</li>
</ol>
<h2>5. Mindset Matters</h2>
<p>This last one is a big one. A lot of times anxiety waxes and wanes with how we think about something. Be mindful of your negative self-talk keeping it in check and working to incorporate perspective. If you know that you are headed into something challenging prepare yourself for it mentally and allow yourself to be ok with the challenge. After all the challenge helps us grow and develop.</p>
<p>Also remember that life is full of choices—granted the options in front of us may be less than ideal but remember that they are there.  Incorporating some of these above strategies could be one of the first choices you make to create change in your life and get a hold of the anxiety</p>
<p>A quick easy way to get some perspective is to acknowledge the things that you are grateful for (this is also a mindfulness practice).  The <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/794635/gratitude-journal"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">gratitude journal</a> is one way to do this where you write down three to five things that you are grateful for every day. Try it out for a week or so and see how you feel. Of course the more time you practice this the more you will feel the benefits.</p>
<h2>Summing It Up</h2>
<p>Anxiety is something that we all experience from time to time working to identify the source of your anxiety will help you discover the best strategies for you. However there are some definite best practices that you can incorporate into your life that are sure to minimize your anxiety and keep you living the active and fulfilling life you want.</p>

<p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.lifehack.org/904623/dinner-for-kids"">35 Easy And Healthy Dinner Ideas For Kids</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.lifehack.org"">Lifehack</a>.</p> <p>Parents jokingly say that the most challenging part about raising kids is deciding what&#8217;s for dinner. While it&#8217;s funny there&#8217;s also a lot of truth to it. Kids can be picky. They love something one day and despise it the next. They also don&#8217;t care if something is healthy or not. And good luck ever getting dinner &#8220;right&#8221; if you have more than one kid. More kids equal more opinions.</p>
<p>What can busy parents do to get their kids to eat healthy meals? How can mealtime be easier?</p>
<p>First you might be wondering if new recipes will even help. Picky eaters are good at refusing anything and everything. Kid-friendly meals won&#8217;t be beneficial if your child isn&#8217;t open to new things. Even kids that aren&#8217;t overly picky tend to shy away from new foods. Ironically they also hate eating the same things over and over.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the best way to overcome meal-time frustration? Make it fun! Distract kids with a bit of creativity. They&#8217;ll be more likely to eat if everyone is relaxed and enjoying the meal.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_6953_1"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_6953_1');"">[1]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_6953_1""></span></p>
<p>Before I dive into the 35 dinner ideas for kids here are some tips for getting young kids to eat and break out of that dinner rut.(Mayo Clinic: <a href=""https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/childrens-health/in-depth/childrens-health/art-20044948"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Children&#8217;s Nutrition: 10 Tips For Picky Eaters</a>))</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Make Breakfast for Dinner</strong> &#8211; Switch things up by serving breakfast for dinner. Kids will love the surprise. Use fruit and sausage to make it more filling. Some days can be exceedingly rough so oatmeal and fruit can even be an option.</li>
<li><strong>Involve Them</strong> &#8211; Kids love to help and will be more excited to try the food they helped make. Touching and seeing the ingredients during the process can help your child become more familiar with them and ease their uncertainty. The biggest benefit is you&#8217;ll be spending time together not to mention the value of learning to cook.</li>
<li><strong>Do Dinner Buffet-Style</strong> &#8211; Set food and toppings out on the table buffet-style and allow kids to dish up their plates. What works well for a buffet?<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_6953_2"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_6953_2');"">[2]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_6953_2""></span> Tacos finger foods and chili are just a few of the many ideas out there. Don&#8217;t be afraid to come up with your own.</li>
<li><strong>Creative Presentation</strong> &#8211; Turning a meal into art is another way to get kids interested. Nothing makes food more interesting than when it looks like a face or boat. Get creative with how you present the food!</li>
<li><strong>Have Fun With Themes</strong> &#8211; The options here are endless. You could base it on your child&#8217;s favorite characters or focus on a different culture or even history. This is a great way to introduce your child to how and what others around the world eat.</li>
<li><strong>Bribery</strong> &#8211; Sometimes parents have to resort to shameless bribery to get kids to eat. It&#8217;s okay to use a little extra motivation to get kids to try something new.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_6953_3"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_6953_3');"">[3]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_6953_3""></span> We all need a boost now and then. Avoid using dessert as a motive to eat dinner but what are some harmless bribes to try? For instance extra screen time or bedtime book.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let&#8217;s get to the dinner ideas. Meal planning is just one more thing to do in an already busy day. This list of dinner recipes for kids can help.

<p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.lifehack.org/903512/benefits-of-meditation"">6 Health Benefits of Meditation (Backed By Science)</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.lifehack.org"">Lifehack</a>.</p> <p>Meditation has a long history dating back at least 3000 years ago. It began as a practice within Hinduism. Perhaps this is the reason why when many people think of meditation they imagine someone sitting in a lotus pose and eyes closed.</p>
<p>What’s missing from this stereotype is an understanding of how much meditation has become a variegated practice of enhancing mental control and repose. Although some people continue to use meditation as part of their religious practice the majority of those who practice meditation do so to reap its many health benefits.</p>
<p>This is understandable given how little time it takes to effectively employ meditation daily (about 20 minutes—less time than most people spend catching up on social media).</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the six science-backed health benefits of meditation.</p>
<h2>1. Stronger the Immune System</h2>
<p>One of the more surprising aspects of meditation is its impact on your immune system. It turns out that regularly calming your mind has a way of building up resistance to various illnesses.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_1704_1"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1704_1');"">[1]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1704_1""></span> That’s not to say that meditation is a firewall that will prevent you from ever getting the flu again. Even so the evidence is pretty strong that it can significantly reduce the chances of your becoming sick.</p>
<p>An example of this benefit comes from a study that compared three groups of people. There was a control group where no changes were made to their daily lives an exercise group where the members completed a set of daily exercises and a meditation group whose members practiced meditation daily.</p>
<p>The study found that after eight weeks the meditation group had 30% fewer respiratory infections when compared to controls. What’s more the severity of those illnesses that did occur among people in the meditation group was significantly less than either the exercise or control group.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_1704_2"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1704_2');"">[2]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1704_2""></span></p>
<p>The takeaway lesson: a regular dose of medication may be just the thing to help guard against some illnesses.</p>
<p>How does this work? No one knows for certain. Even so it seems likely that because meditation reduces stress this has the follow-on effect of helping the body stay in a strong state of readiness to combat illness.</p>
<h2>2. Decreased Psychological Stress</h2>
<p>Everyone experiences <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/900268/how-to-not-stress"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">stress</a>. If you are conscious then you experience stress. Some sources of stress are pleasant moving into your dream home. Many sources of stress are unpleasant like being fired from work the loss of a loved one the cost of having your car repaired.</p>
<p>No matter the source and no matter whether the stress is pleasant or cringeworthy it can take a toll on your mental and physical reserves. Consequently finding effective ways to control your stress is important for living a full and rewarding life.</p>
<p>Meditation can be one of the tools used to reach this goal. This has been shown in many studies. For example researchers Cara Geary and Susan Rosenthal compared stress levels in two groups of subjects over the course of eight weeks. One group received training in meditation (and then performed it consistently) while the other group coped with stress in their usual manner.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly the meditation group had significantly less stress after eight weeks. But what is more surprising is that the meditation group continued to have lower stress levels one year later. Moreover they also rated their overall sense of well-being as higher than those who had not received training in meditation.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_1704_3"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1704_3');"">[3]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1704_3""></span></p>
<p>The takeaway lesson is that a brief introduction to meditation can lead to lifestyle changes that have long-term impacts.</p>
<h2>3. Enhanced Quality of Sleep</h2>
<p>Everyone has experienced how much sleep impacts their mood and their ability to function effectively. A good night’s rest sets the foundation for the day ahead. Likewise a night of tossing and turning creates an obstacle to pushing forward toward your goals the following day.</p>
<p>It’s a well-known problem that 60 million Americans struggle with each year.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_1704_4"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1704_4');"">[4]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1704_4""></span> If you are one of those who chronically wrestle with getting enough good quality sleep meditation may just be the thing that helps you turn the corner.</p>
<p>One study that supports this idea included a group of participants that were studied for one year. All participants presented with significantly disturbed sleep. The researchers divided the group into two subgroups. One was taught simple meditation techniques. The other group was given instructions on how to get a better night’s rest (e.g. etc.).</p>
<p>At the end of the year these two groups showed significant differences in their quality of sleep. The meditation group had markedly improved sleep—similar to what is found with those who use medication to treat sleep problems. They found that the power of meditation to improve the quality of sleep was roughly equal to that of medication or cognitive behavior therapy.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_1704_5"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1704_5');"">[5]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1704_5""></span></p>
<p>The other group—the one that was provided sleep education/instruction—showed only mild improvement in sleep.</p>
<p>But it is not just one study that supports the link between meditation and improved sleep. A 2018 review of 18 studies on meditation including a total of 1654 participants found that meditation improved the quality of sleep much more than using a &#8220;wait and see&#8221; approach.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_1704_6"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1704_6');"">[6]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1704_6""></span></p>
<h2>4. Decreased Cellular Aging</h2>
<p>Although practicing meditation does not lead to eternal youth it does appear to reduce the speed at which cells age and eventually decay. It seems likely that part of the mechanism by which meditation induces this effect is by increasing the presence of telomerase an enzyme that protects genes from aging (protects but does not ultimately prevent).<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_1704_7"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1704_7');"">[7]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1704_7""></span></p>
<p>When this enzyme is scarce cells tend to age faster. When it is in abundance cells age more slowly. Likewise the telomerase enzyme increases when someone is coping well with life and decreases when one feels extremely stressed.</p>
<p>Meditation appears to cause an increase in this enzyme and reduces the rate of cellular aging. The mechanism by which this happens may be the reduction in psychological stress that is often seen in those who meditate. By reducing tension in life and increasing a sense of well-being the presence of telomerase should increase. In turn cells live longer.</p>
<p>The longer your cells live the more slowly they need to be replaced and the slower you age.</p>
<h2>5. Increased Memory</h2>
<p>Several studies show that meditation enhances <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/13-simple-tricks-improve-your-memory.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">memory</a>. It improves blood flow in the brain which may account for the improvements in memory.</p>
<p>Although research has not shown that one form of meditation is superior to another it has shown that it only takes about ten minutes of meditation each day for someone to experience these benefits. Moreover the improvements in memory begin to show up soon after someone begins to make meditation a daily habit.</p>
<p>An example of this is found in a study that compared two groups of subjects. The first group consisted of people who listened to a 13-minute guided meditation recording each day. The other group of subjects listened to a 13-minute podcast (unrelated to meditation).</p>
<p>At the end of eight weeks both groups were tested and the one that performed daily meditation showed significant improvement in both long-term memory and recognition memory. Not surprisingly those that meditated also showed less stress.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_1704_8"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1704_8');"">[8]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1704_8""></span></p>
<h2>6. Decreased Anxiety</h2>
<p><a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/812967/anxiety-coping-mechanisms"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Anxiety</a> is part of life that everyone experiences from time to time. It arises anxiety becomes a major source of concern—one that has life-changing consequences: loss of employment and physical illness.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_1704_9"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1704_9');"">[9]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1704_9""></span> Even milder (but chronic) anxiety can have a significant impact on one’s happiness and ability to function at his or her best.</p>
<p>Fortunately many effective approaches reduce or eliminate anxiety. These include Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) and others. But none of these approaches can compete with the simplicity and ease of meditation.</p>
<p>A 2010 review of 39 studies involving 1 140 participants concluded that meditation has a positive impact on reducing anxiety. Interestingly the authors also found that meditation is sometimes helpful in reducing anxiety that arises as a function of chronic pain and cancer treatments.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_1704_10"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_1704_10');"">[10]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_1704_10""></span></p>
<p>As was true with memory it does not require long periods of meditation for it to be effective in reducing anxiety. Just 20 minutes a day can prove helpful.</p>
<p>Many people are likely to see improvement in their anxiety levels by following a ten-minute guided meditation once in the morning and once again in the evening. Below is a short video to help you.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Consistently practicing short periods of meditation can result in numerous benefits. Yet it takes very little effort and costs nothing but a brief bit of your time. It is easy to learn and can be done at home or when away traveling.</p>
<p>Anyone wanting to improve their quality of life can readily take advantage of this tool. The only thing needed is to make a decision—start today.</p>
<p>You can easily do that by going to Ron Siegel’s website (he is a Professor at Harvard Medical school) and listening to one of his guided meditations. Barbara Fredrickson Professor of Psychology at the University of North Carolina is one of the foremost researchers on meditation. She has free guided meditations on her website that will get you started enjoying the benefits of making this a daily practice.</p>

But modern life is busy and we may not always have the time to cook healthy meals (or we may not even know how to). When food doesn&#8217;t cut it another way to ensure we get all the nutrients we need is by taking supplements. In this article I&#8217;ll take a closer look at combined omega 3-6-9 supplements.</p>
<p>I will start by covering what omega fatty acids are how they affect our overall health and why our bodies need them. Then we&#8217;ll take a look at omega supplements specifically and how to choose a good one.</p>
<p>So are you striving to optimize your overall health and lead a healthier lifestyle? Here&#8217;s what you need to know about omega 3 and 9 acids to achieve your goal.</p>

<h2>What Are Omega Fatty Acids?</h2>
<p>Omega fatty acids are polyunsaturated fats that are also known as &#8220;essential fats.&#8221; In other words these are fats that our body cannot produce and we need to take them through our food or as <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/7-vitamins-supplements-shouldnt-taking.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">supplements</a>.</p>
<p>The name &#8220;polyunsaturated&#8221; is derived from their chemical composition where &#8220;poly&#8221; stands for &#8220;many &#8221; and &#8220;unsaturated&#8221; explains the double bonds they contain. This means that omega fatty acids have many of these bonds. There are also &#8220;monounsaturated&#8221; fats that contain only one double bond.</p>
<p>The position of the first double unsaturated bond from the end of the molecular chain (the omega) is what determines whether that&#8217;s an omega-3 or omega-9 fatty acid.</p>
<p>For example the first double bond is found on the third carbon atom counting back from the molecular tail and in omega-6 and -9 on the sixth and ninth carbon atom respectively.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_2592_1"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_2592_1');"">[1]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2592_1""></span></p>
<h2>A Quick Guide to Omega 3-6-9</h2>
<p>Omega-3 acids have been a well-known dietary supplement especially among the <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/879168/healthy-life"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">healthy lifestyle</a> community.</p>
<p>However very few consumers know about the benefits of other fatty acids—such as omega-6 and -9—and how to balance their intake to optimize their health. So let&#8217;s have a better look at these healthy fats.</p>
<h4>Omega-3 Fatty Acids</h4>
<p>Omega-3 is the most popular among unsaturated fats. They are also known as essential fats because they are necessary for human growth and development. However the human body cannot produce them so the only way to enjoy their benefits is to take them through the food we consume or in the form of a supplement.</p>
<p>The omega-3 group is made of different types of unsaturated fatty acids whose molecular chains vary in shape and size.</p>
<p>These are the most popular:</p>
<ul>
<li>ALA (Alpha-linoleic acid) &#8211; ALA is an 18-carbon chain fatty acid that our body uses for regulating and other heart-related diseases.</li>
<li>The EPA (Eicosapentaenoic acid) &#8211; EPA is a 20-carbon chain fatty acid usually prescribed to patients who have experienced a heart attack and chemo treatments. It&#8217;s also believed to alleviate depression symptoms and manage inflammation caused by chronic diseases.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_2592_2"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_2592_2');"">[2]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2592_2""></span> However there is still plenty of research to be done to support many of these claims.</li>
<li>DHA (Docosahexaenoic acid) &#8211; DHA is a 22-carbon chain fatty acid commonly used for cholesterol control and plays an important role in infant development especially with eye and nerve tissues.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I have already mentioned the human body is not able to synthesize these essential fats. Luckily there are plenty of natural sources that we can and should use in the everyday diet to achieve optimal health.</p>
<p>Here are the most important sources of omega-3 acids:</p>
<ul>
<li>Animal sources: salmon and dairy from grass-fed animals etc.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Omega-6 Fatty Acids</h4>
<p>Another healthy type of unsaturated fats is omega-6. Although not as popular as the omega-3 these fats play an important role in keeping our health in check. They are also considered &#8220;essential&#8221; and need to be consumed through the food in our diet.</p>
<p>These are the four types of omega-6 fatty acids:</p>
<ul>
<li>LA (Linoleic acid) &#8211; LA is the main polyunsaturated fatty acid found in nuts mostly used to prevent and fight coronary heart disease. It is also a popular compound in many cosmetic products used to fight acne and other skin conditions.</li>
<li>ARA (Arachidonic Acid) &#8211; ARA is a 20-carbon chain fatty acid that helps regulate the immune system. The body relies on ARA to create inflammation a normal physical function much needed to fight bacteria and viruses and repair damaged tissues.</li>
<li>GLA (Gamma-linoleic) &#8211; GLA is mostly used to treat arthritis nerve damage caused by diabetes and prevent heart diseases.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_2592_3"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_2592_3');"">[3]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2592_3""></span></li>
<li>CLA (Conjugated linoleic acid) &#8211; CLA is a natural type of trans fat and a popular weight loss supplement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good sources of omega-6 polyunsaturated fats are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Animal sources: dairy safflower seeds and sunflower oils etc.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Omega-9 Fatty Acids</h4>
<p>Unlike the omega-3 and -6 polyunsaturated fats omega-9 is a group of monounsaturated fats. They are also nonessential because the human body has the ability to produce them and you don&#8217;t have to take supplements to regulate their intake.</p>
<p>The most common one among the omega-9 fatty acids is oleic acid. Several studies suggest that including oleic acid in your diet reduces the risk of coronary heart disease and reduces inflammation.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_2592_4"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_2592_4');"">[4]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2592_4""></span></p>
<p>Good sources of omega-9 are olive oil and 9 Health Benefits</h2>
<p>Essential and nonessential omega fatty acids are incredibly for human health and development. The benefits of healthy fatty acids are many. In fact very few other nutrients have been studied and researched to the same extent as the omega fatty acids.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most important health benefits of these fatty acids:</p>
<h4>Health Benefits of Omega-3 Fatty Acids</h4>
<ul>
<li>Helps with improving heart disease risk factors: reduces triglycerides prevents arteriosclerosis<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_2592_5"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_2592_5');"">[5]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2592_5""></span></li>
<li>Alleviates depression and anxiety symptoms</li>
<li>Manages chronic inflammation that can lead to heart attacks and many other diseases</li>
<li>Helps you keep autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis ulcerative colitis under control</li>
<li>Improves mental disorder symptoms: people with mental disorders prove to have low levels of blood omega-3<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_2592_6"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_2592_6');"">[6]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2592_6""></span></li>
<li>Reduces liver fat in humans in cases of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)</li>
<li>Crucial for eye and nerve tissue development as it is a major structural component of the retina</li>
</ul>
<h4>Health Benefits of Omega-6 Fatty Acids</h4>
<ul>
<li>Provides energy</li>
<li>Regulates pro-inflammatory processes in the body essential for fighting infections and injury<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_2592_7"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_2592_7');"">[7]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_2592_7""></span></li>
<li>May fight risk factors of cardiovascular diseases and stroke</li>
</ul>
<h2>Omega-3 Vs. Omega-6</h2>
<p>While they are both polyunsaturated essential fatty acids that we need to consume through food and supplements there are a few key differences between omega-3 vs. omega-6. For one they have a different chemical structure.</p>
<p>Secondly omega-3 regulates the anti-inflammatory processes but omega-6 is responsible for pro-inflammatory processes. This means that they regulate different functions of the immune system and an imbalance can result in various diseases.</p>
<p>Finally omega-6 fatty acids are easy to come by as they are present in many foods the western society consumes regularly. Omega-3-rich-food consumption is lower than ever.</p>
<p>To control the presence of omega-6 fatty acids in your body lower the intake of processed seeds and seed oils.</p>
<h2>Should You Take Omega 3-6-9 Supplements?</h2>
<p>There is no doubt that omega fatty acids are essential for our mental and physical development. You will find lots and lots of <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/900667/vitamins-for-energy"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">combined supplements</a> in the health stores. But the real question is: do you really need to take them?</p>
<p>We know that a disbalance in fatty acid ratios in the human body might cause inflammation and various other diseases. We also know that supplements are meant to help you balance the presence of fatty acids in the body and give you the right proportions such as 2:1:1 for omegas 3 you probably already get enough of omega 6 through food and your body can produce omega 9 by itself. Unless you eat a very unhealthy diet you might be better off with a pure omega-3 supplement instead.</p>
<p>In short the best way to balance your omega intake is to be mindful of the food you consume.</p>
<h2>What Is the Best Omega 3-6-9 Supplement?</h2>
<p>If you do decide to go for a combined supplement make sure you choose oils that have been cold-pressed. This is a natural method that uses a limited amount of heat in the extraction process and doesn&#8217;t oxidize the fatty acids.</p>
<p>Omega 3-6-9 supplements that contain an antioxidant and have omega-3 content higher than 0.3 grams per serving are the best. Moreover fish oil and algal oil-based supplements are a better choice because of the higher EPA and DHA presence shown to have greater health benefits than the ALA found in flaxseed oils.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Omega 3-6-9 foods and supplements are growing in popularity by the day. You might be tempted to take a supplement but try to <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/articles/featured/diet-tips-more-for-a-healthy-and-trim-body.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">eat a balanced diet</a> instead. Nature has already provided us with all the necessary nutrients and all we have to do is choose the right ones to achieve overall health. If you do decide to take a supplement pick one that will help you prevent disease or fight any existing condition.</p>
<p>People practicing a typical Western diet take plenty of omega-6 through their food and the body has a natural ability to produce omega-9 fatty acids.</p>
<p>So if your diet is already healthy consider taking only omega 3s. Chances are the benefits will be quite the same or even better than if you take combined omega supplements.</p>

Still even if you are not the kind of person who reads scientific papers you will undoubtedly have experienced what happens when you do not have healthy sleep habits. You make more mistakes you <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/642157/revenge-of-the-lack-of-sleep"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">become forgetful</a> and your productivity drops like a rock not to mention how rotten you feel throughout the day.</p>
<p>Sleep is vital for regulating so many parts of our bodies from allowing for essential repairs to our bodies to regulating the hormones that contribute to stress and high blood pressure.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_7695_1"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7695_1');"">[1]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7695_1""></span> Without sleep become a non-functioning human being.</p>
<p>So if we agree that getting enough sleep is essential if you want to have an abundance of energy and vitality what healthy sleep habits can you develop to enhance these positive effects and enable you to get enough sleep consistently?</p>
<p>Here are eight healthy sleep habits that can help you stay alert and focused every day.</p>
<h2>1. Have a Set Sleeping Time</h2>
<p>Probably the most effective way of ensuring that you are getting enough sleep is going to bed and waking up at the same time each day. This applies to weekdays as well as weekends.</p>
<p>Now how you do this is up to you. You first need to know how much sleep you need to feel rested. For me I need around six hours of sleep a day. The next thing you need to know is how long it usually takes you to fall asleep. For me I generally require around thirty minutes to fall asleep.</p>
<p>Now here we are all different. Some of you may need eight or nine hours sleep (and generally the younger you are the more sleep you need) or you may operate perfectly fine on five or six hours. My wife can fall asleep as soon as her head hits the pillow. I need at least thirty minutes before I fall asleep.</p>
<p>Once you know how much sleep you need and how long it usually takes you to fall asleep you can work out what time you need to go to bed. If you need six hours of sleep require thirty minutes to fall asleep and need to wake up at 7:30 am you need to go to bed no later than midnight.</p>
<p>So the formula you need is:</p>
<p>amount of sleep you need (in hours) + average time to fall asleep (in minutes) &#8211; time you need to wake up = your bedtime</p>
<p>Once you know your bedtime make that a non-negotiable part of your life.</p>
<h2>2. Don&#8217;t Leave Your Work With Unresolved Issues</h2>
<p>So many people struggle to get a good quality night&#8217;s sleep because they have unresolved issues left over from the day. These unresolved issues cause our minds to worry and stress.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s happening is that your conscious mind is worrying about them because you have not decided what action to take to resolve them. Instead before you go to bed write out everything that&#8217;s on your mind and decide what you need to do to resolve them. Now this does not mean you have to solve the problem at the moment. What it means is that you need to decide what to do next.</p>
<p>For example imagine just before you finished work you received an email informing you that next week&#8217;s important presentation has been moved forward to Friday—not the nicest email to receive at 5:50 pm on a Wednesday. Instead of leaving it until tomorrow where you will worry about it all evening open up your calendar and block out a couple of hours to work on the presentation tomorrow. Rearrange any appointments if necessary.</p>
<p>Just those few minutes rearranging your schedule will take the problem off your mind and free you from the stress and worry you would have if you did not do that. Essentially what you are doing is taking the problem out of your conscious mind and moving it to your subconscious mind—the problem-solving part of your brain.</p>
<h2>3. Plan the Day a Day Before</h2>
<p>Similar to the previous point make sure you have a <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/882629/planning-your-day"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">plan for tomorrow</a>. This stops you from worrying about what you have to do tomorrow. You know what&#8217;s important and you know you have enough time to do it.</p>
<p>Planning the day should not take more than ten to fifteen minutes but the effect of knowing what you want to get done the next day puts you in a much more relaxed state and being in a relaxed state means you are much more likely to have a good nights sleep.</p>
<p>The added benefit of knowing what you want to get done tomorrow is that you begin the day with more focus which inevitably gives you more energy to get the work done.</p>
<p>When you don&#8217;t have a plan for the day you waste so much time and effort trying to decide what to work on you end up working on other people&#8217;s priorities rather than your own. You will feel you have been busy at the end of the day but you&#8217;ve been busy doing other people&#8217;s work and not your own.</p>
<h2>4. Find Out How Much Sleep You Need</h2>
<p>Having healthy sleep habits requires knowing how much sleep you need. Each one of us is different. Some of us will need eight hours and others need six. How many hours of sleep do you need to feel energetic?</p>
<p>You may need to experiment to find this. Often we have allowed ourselves to be influenced by what we read in the media but not everyone needs eight hours of sleep.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_7695_2"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7695_2');"">[2]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7695_2""></span> Some find that nine or even ten hours leave them feeling fully restored.</p>
<p>Margaret Thatcher famously only required four hours. Elon Musk finds that around six hours are required for optimum productivity and Barack Obama&#8217;s was five hours a night.</p>
<p>So take a few weeks and experiment. Try six hours for a few days and see how you feel. If you find you feel energetic and focused throughout the day then perhaps that&#8217;s all you need.</p>
<p>If you find yourself feeling tired mid to late afternoon increase your sleep time by an hour and try seven. You will soon find your optimum sleep time. Once you know that you can structure your day around that time.</p>
<h2>5. Eat Early</h2>
<p>If you want to get a better sleep quality then eat your final meal of the day early. My own experience here is that if I eat after 8 pm I wake up feeling terrible and lethargic—not the best way to start my day energetically.</p>
<p>Now the science is unproven here but one thing we do know is that your body&#8217;s ability to digest food slows down while you sleep.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_7695_3"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7695_3');"">[3]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7695_3""></span> This means if you go to bed with a full stomach of undigested food much of that food will still be undigested when you wake up in the morning. This is why many of us feel lethargic in the morning because our body has to consume vital energy doing something that it should have done before we went to bed.</p>
<p>Eating earlier means your body has time to fully digest your food before you go to bed and you will wake up feeling far more energetic.</p>
<h2>6. Start the Day With a Morning Routine</h2>
<p>If you want to start the day with energy you need a consistent <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/768258/morning-routine-to-make-your-day"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">morning routine</a>. Light exercise and a few minutes reading something educational will energize your day far more than rushing out of bed trying to decide what to wear and doom scrolling through your social media and news feeds.</p>
<p>Now here&#8217;s the thing about effective morning routines. Decide how much time you need to complete your morning routines and make sure you have that time before starting your day.</p>
<p>For example many of my morning calls begin at 8 am. This means my day starts at 8. So I wake up at 7 am. I need forty-five minutes for my morning routines and I like to have fifteen minutes to focus on myself before my first call.</p>
<p>Keep away from email and other notifications an hour or so before you go to bed. Messages and emails have a terrible habit of tripping our negative emotions which is never a good state of being in just before you retire for the day.</p>
<p>Set yourself a cut-off time for reading messages and emails. For example if you decided bedtime is midnight set 10 pm as your cut-off time. At 10 pm close down your email and messaging services such as Slack or What&#8217;s App. You do not want to risk receiving messages from your boss or colleagues—messages that are likely to spike your negative emotions.</p>
<p>If you have been in the habit of constantly checking your emails and messages right up to the point of going to bed this may be not easy to implement at first but it is well worth it and you will get used to it. You can use your phone&#8217;s automated &#8220;do not disturb&#8221; function where your phone automatically puts itself on do not disturb at a set time. That way there&#8217;s no bleeping or vibrating—just quiet and calm before you go to bed.</p>
<h2>7. Don&#8217;t Snooze!</h2>
<p>I know when our alarms go off in the morning we want to stay in bed for a few more minutes mainly when it&#8217;s cold and wet outside. But those extra few minutes are terrible on our energy levels.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_7695_4"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7695_4');"">[4]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7695_4""></span></p>
<p>As we wake up in the morning we are coming towards the end of a REM (rapid eye movement) sleep cycle. When we snooze we quickly fall back into a new REM sleep cycle. The problem here is when we wake up in the middle or near the beginning of a REM sleep cycle we will feel foggy and groggy and it takes a long time to pull ourselves out of that feeling.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_7695_4"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7695_4');"">[4]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7695_4""></span></p>
<p>So no matter how you feel when your first alarm goes off in the morning don&#8217;t hit that snooze button. If you have difficulty with this try Mel Robbins&#8217; 5 Second Rule: when you wake up you count to five and get out of bed. I promise you will feel so much better in the day if you do this.</p>
<h2>8. Use Power Naps</h2>
<p>This was a revelation to me. Before I discovered power naps I would push through the afternoon slump. The work I did was slow and uninspiring. Once I found that taking a short thirty-minute nap I found something Winston Churchill discovered a hundred years ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think you will be doing less work because you sleep during the day. That&#8217;s a foolish notion held by people who have no imagination. You will be able to accomplish more. You get two days in one-well at least one and a half I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That part about getting at least one and a half days I found to be true. On days I do not take a power nap I am mentally finished by six or seven in the evening not capable of doing much more than vegetating in front of YouTube or Netflix. On days I take a nap I&#8217;m fully alert right through the evening able to learn something new by taking a course or having meaningful conversations with my wife.</p>
<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<p>These eight tips on healthy sleep habits are just the start of your journey to maximizing your energy each day. The key is to understand that we are all different and you will need to experiment. Once you find your best sleep time you can build your day around making sure you get your optimum hours of sleep which creates an energizing morning routine and a relaxing close to your day.</p>
<p>Follow these healthy sleep habits and you will find yourself having plenty of energy and ultimately feeling a lot happier and less stressed.</p>

<p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.lifehack.org/903508/what-is-abstract-thinking"">What Is Abstract Thinking And How To Develop It</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.lifehack.org"">Lifehack</a>.</p> <p>While incredibly valuable for making wise decisions in work and life abstract thinking is greatly underappreciated.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract thinking refers to our ability to understand complex concepts that don’t rely directly on our physical senses.</strong> Such thinking relies on our capacity to hold frameworks and models in our minds of how the world works. The ability for abstract thinking is so necessary for our increasingly complex and digitalized world—where our physical senses are not nearly sufficient to lead us in the right direction.</p>
<p>The key to abstract thinking comes from metacognition—our ability to understand our own mental processes. In turn metacognition embodies the essence of abstract thinking as we cannot observe with our senses our mental processes. We have to rely on abstractions—models of our mental processes—to understand how we feel and think.</p>
<p>Cultivating our metacognition represents an excellent way to develop abstract thinking.</p>

<h2>Developing Metacognition to Strengthen Abstract Thinking</h2>
<p>Were you ever in a situation when you received constructive criticism—well-delivered or rough—from your boss or your coach? What did your gut tell you to do at that moment? Did it tell you to be aggressive and shout back? Perhaps it told you to hunker down and disengage? Maybe it pushed you to put your fingers in your ears with a “la-la-la or Flight</h3>
<p>Behavioral scientists call these three types of responses the “fight or flight” response. You might have heard about it as the saber-tooth tiger response meaning the system our brain evolved to deal with threats in our ancestral savanna environment. This response stems from the older parts of our brain which developed early in our evolutionary process.</p>
<p>Fight or flight form a central part of one of the two systems of thinking that determine our mental processes. It’s not the old Freudian model of the id which has been left behind by recent research.</p>
<p>One of the main scholars in this field is Daniel Kahneman who won the Nobel Prize for his research on behavioral economics. He calls the two systems of thinking System 1 and 2 but I think “autopilot system” and “intentional system” describe these systems more clearly.</p>
<p>Developing your metacognition involves internalizing these two systems into the way you think about yourself and your own mental processes. In turn you also develop your abstract thinking by thinking in an abstract manner about your own thinking.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_7407_1"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7407_1');"">[1]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7407_1""></span></p>
<p>The autopilot system corresponds to our emotions and intuitions—that’s where we get the fight or flight response. This system guides our daily habits helps us make snap decisions and allows us to react instantly to dangerous life-and-death situations.</p>
<h3>Fight-or-Flight in Modern Life</h3>
<p>While helping our survival in the past the fight-or-flight response is not a great fit for many aspects of modern life. We have many small stresses that are not life-threatening but the autopilot system treats them as saber-tooth tigers. Doing so produces an unnecessarily stressful everyday life experience that undermines our mental and physical well-being.</p>
<p>Moreover the snap judgments resulting from intuitions and emotions usually feel “true” precisely because they are fast and powerful and we feel very comfortable when we go with them. The decisions arising from our gut reactions are often right especially in situations that resemble the ancient savanna.</p>
<p>Unfortunately—in too many cases—they’re wrong as our modern environments have many elements that are unlike the savanna and with growing technological disruption the office of the future will look even less like our ancestral environment. The autopilot system will lead us astray more and more in systematic and predictable ways.</p>
<p>The intentional system reflects rational thinking and centers around the prefrontal cortex—the part of the brain that evolved more recently. According to recent research it developed as humans started to live within larger social groups. This thinking system helps us handle more complex mental activities such as managing individual and group relationships and habits.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_7407_2"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7407_2');"">[2]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7407_2""></span></p>
<p>While the automatic system requires no conscious effort to function the intentional system requires a deliberate effort to turn on and is mentally tiring. Fortunately with enough motivation and appropriate training the intentional system can turn on in situations where the autopilot system is prone to make systematic and predictable errors.</p>
<h2>Intentional Metacognition Intentional Abstract Thinking</h2>
<p>Effective metacognition involves addressing the problems caused by our autopilot systems. You need to catch areas where it goes wrong and doing so involves abstracting yourself from your own emotions and intuitions. You need to recognize that your emotions will often lie to you—as in the example with constructive critical feedback.</p>
<p>You also need to be able to manage your own emotions and train them to be more aligned with reality. Both the recognition and the training rely on the intentional system. By strengthening your intentional system’s ability to guide your autopilot system you will build up your metacognitive abilities and your abstract thinking.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_7407_3"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7407_3');"">[3]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7407_3""></span></p>
<h3>We Are Not Entirely Rational Thinkers</h3>
<p>We tend to think of ourselves as rational thinkers usually using the intentional system. Unfortunately that’s not the case.</p>
<p>The autopilot system has been compared by scholars of this topic to an elephant. It’s by far the more powerful and predominant of the two systems. Our emotions can often overwhelm our rationality. Moreover our intuition and habits dominate the majority of our life. We’re usually in autopilot mode. That’s not a bad thing at all as it would be mentally exhausting to think through our every action and decision.</p>
<p>The intentional system is like the elephant’s rider. It can guide the elephant deliberately to go in a direction that matches our actual goals. Certainly the elephant part of the brain is huge and unwieldy slow to turn and change and stampedes at threats. But we can train the elephant. Your rider can become an elephant whisperer. Over time you can use the intentional system to change your automatic thinking and behavior patterns to avoid dangerous judgment errors.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s crucial to recognize that these two systems of thinking are counterintuitive. They don’t align with our conscious self-perception. Our mind feels like a cohesive whole. Unfortunately this self-perception is simply a comfortable myth that helps us make it through the day. There is no actual “there” there—our sense of self is a construct that results from multiple complex mental processes within the autopilot and intentional system.</p>
<p>When I first found that out it blew my mind. It takes a bit of time to incorporate this realization into your mental model of yourself and others—in other words how you perceive your mind to work. Bottom-line is that you’re not who you think you are. The conscious self-reflective part of you is like a little rider on top of that huge elephant of emotions and intuitions.</p>
<p>Want to see what the tension between the autopilot system and the intentional system feels like in real life? Think back to the last time your supervisor or investor gave you constructive critical feedback. How easy was it to truly listen and take in the information instead of defending yourself and your work? That strain is you using your willpower to get the intentional system to override the cravings of the autopilot system.</p>
<p>For another example consider the last flame war you got into online or perhaps an in-person argument with your loved one. Did the flame war or in-person argument solve things? Did you manage to convince the other person?</p>
<p>I’d be surprised if it did. Arguments usually don’t lead to anything beneficial. Often even if we win the argument we end up harming relationships we care about. It’s like cutting off your nose to spite your face; a bad idea all around.</p>
<p>Looking back you probably regret at least some of the flame wars or in-person arguments in which you’ve engaged. If so why did you engage? It’s the old fight response coming to the fore without you noticing it. It’s not immediately obvious that a fight response will hurt you down the road. Thus you let the elephant go rogue and it stampeded all over the place.</p>
<p>Whether in personal or business settings letting loose the elephant is like allowing a bull into a china shop. Broken dishes will be the least of your problems. Scholars use “akrasia” to refer to such situations where we act against our better judgment. In other words defined in behavioral science as going against our own <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/the-power-self-reflection-ten-questions-you-should-ask-yourself.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">self-reflective</a> goals.</p>
<h2>What If My Gut Helped Me Make Many Good Decisions?</h2>
<p>It’s wise to be wary of absolute statements. Research shows that in some instances gut reactions can be helpful in decision-making contexts.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_7407_4"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7407_4');"">[4]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7407_4""></span> In other words it’s not necessarily irrational to follow your gut. Developing your metacognitive skills involves learning when going with your gut may be a better idea and when it may not.</p>
<p>For instance a great deal of experience on a topic where you get quick and accurate feedback on your judgments may enable your intuitions to pick up valuable and subtle signals that more objective measurements may not discern. Our intuitions are good at learning patterns and immediate feedback about our decision-making helps us develop high-quality expertise through improving pattern recognition.</p>
<p>Another example: if you have a long-standing business relationship with someone and then you experience negative gut responses about their behavior being somehow off in a new business deal it’s time to double-check the fine print. The savanna environment involved us living in tribes where we had to rely on our gut reactions to evaluate fellow tribal members.</p>
<p>However don’t buy into the myth that you can tell apart lies from truths. Studies show that we—yes unless you’re a trained CIA interrogator—are very bad at distinguishing falsehoods from accurate statements. In fact research by Charles Bond Jr and Bella DePaul shows that we only detect fifty-four percent of lies—a shocking statistic considering we’d get fifty percent if we used random chance.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_7407_5"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7407_5');"">[5]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7407_5""></span></p>
<p>Overall it’s never a good idea to just go with your gut. Even in cases where you think you can rely on your intuitions it’s best to use your instincts as just a warning sign of potential danger and evaluate the situation analytically.</p>
<p>For example the person with whom you have a long business relationship might have just gotten some bad news about their family and their demeanor caused your instincts to misread the situation. Your extensive experience in a given topic might bring you to ruin if the market context changes around you and you find yourself using your old intuitions in a different environment like a fish out of water.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To survive and thrive in the modern world you need to develop your abstract thinking—the ability to think about the world through frameworks and models. To do so you need to cultivate your metacognition which is the capacity to understand and manage effectively your own mental processes—your thoughts and feelings.</p>
<p>The key to doing so involves the abstract thinking framework of the autopilot system and intentional system. You need to abstract yourself from your existing autopilot system’s emotions and intuitions recognize and catch when they are leading you in the wrong direction and train them to lead you in the right direction instead of using your intentional system.</p>

<p>In this article I&#8217;ll explore what focused meditation is how it differs in the pool of many styles of meditation and how to implement and start this practice today. Likewise I&#8217;ll highlight the benefits of a focused meditation practice for your overall health.</p>

<h2>What Is Focused Meditation?</h2>
<p>Meditation is the practice of becoming self-aware through breath and attention to connect the mind and spirit.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_7940_1"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7940_1');"">[1]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7940_1""></span> Focused meditation also known as concentrative meditation is the practice of meditating and bringing your attention to one single object. This object can be something practical and tangible such as a mandala painting or a candle flame. It can also be something abstract such as a phrase (also known as mantra) or a sound (such as Om).<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_7940_2"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7940_2');"">[2]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7940_2""></span><sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_7940_3"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7940_3');"">[3]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7940_3""></span></p>
<p>Whatever you settle your attention on becomes the focus of your meditation. None of these object examples are better than others—they are simply choices depending on what you&#8217;re looking to get out of your practice. For example practitioners will choose candle gazing to interpret the images the flame makes in the shadows while others will choose a mantra because that particular phrase or word empowers or heals them.</p>
<h4>How Does It Differ From Other Meditation Styles?</h4>
<p>All meditation styles and practices overlap and build on each other. Their basic foundation is the same: to bring the practitioner<a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/898496/self-introspection"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> insight and introspection</a>.</p>
<p>Focused meditation is the practice of focusing on one single object for the duration of the practice. How this differs from other meditation styles is that it gives the practitioner something tangible to do: focus. It&#8217;s almost like giving your mind an action to perform—listen to this sound etc. This is also one of the reasons why this particular meditation style is great for beginners!</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges in any meditation practice is that the mind gets carried away and we lose ourselves to random thoughts. This &#8220;obstacle&#8221; is actually a style of meditation in and of itself called Vipassana.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_7940_4"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7940_4');"">[4]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7940_4""></span> However we give the mind something to do so that it&#8217;s not simply left to its own devices. This type of meditation is beneficial for beginners and for practitioners who prefer some structure and guidance to their meditations.</p>
<h2>The Benefits of Focused Meditation</h2>
<p>In this style of meditation what you&#8217;re really doing is exercising your mental muscles. Your brain is highly affected by a dedicated and concentrated meditation practice.</p>
<p>Scientists have performed countless studies on focused meditation and have found that active meditators have more gray matter volume in their brain and offsetting the cognitive decline that comes with aging. So not only does practicing focused meditation help you learn how to focus better on certain tasks but it also improves similar functions such as memory. <sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_7940_5"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7940_5');"">[5]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7940_5""></span></p>
<p>Likewise it helps in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety which our society is currently crippled with.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_7940_6"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_7940_6');"">[6]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_7940_6""></span> By settling your attention on an object you are essentially building your ability to observe your thoughts and sensations from a place of objectivity. This allows you to detach from negative self-talk that is often the breeding ground for depression and other mental illnesses.</p>
<h2>How to Practice Focused Meditation</h2>
<p>Here are six tips to help you practice focused meditation. Based on your availability and interest these tips may change and evolve. That&#8217;s the point: to create a structured practice that caters to your needs.</p>
<h4>1. Find a Comfortable Seat</h4>
<p>As with any meditation practice comfort is truly key. The physical body responds to meditation practice by alerting you to whether it is comfortable and supported or stressed out and in pain. This is best observed in practitioners who tend to slouch and lose the tall supported spine that is essential to meditation practice.</p>
<p>A simple rule in meditative sitting is to ensure that your hips are higher than your knees. Therefore choosing to sit in a chair instead of on the floor may be a smart decision or perhaps propping yourself up on a cushion. At the end of the day it does not matter how you sit. All that matters is that you are supported and comfortable sitting for some time.</p>
<h4>2. Choose Your Object of Focus</h4>
<p>Every meditation session is going to be different because no single day is the same for any one person. Therefore choosing an object is much more about listening to what you need at this time versus following any doctrine or &#8220;rule.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not sure and have a hard time deciding make your breath the object and follow it in on the inhale and out on the exhale. Then assign each inhale and exhale a number and once you reach 10 start over. This is one of the simpler methods of keeping your mind occupied—by giving it a task. This also trains your mind and over time and with practice your mind will easily focus on an object without too much effort.</p>
<h4>3. Set Your Desired Time or &#8220;Go With the Flow&#8221;</h4>
<p>If you have a structured routine and would like to stick to your schedule set a gentle timer for how long you&#8217;d like your meditation to be. This is also your opportunity to throw out the notion that any meditation has to be a certain length of time to be correct—it does not.</p>
<p>Likewise if you have the time you can also listen to your body and come out of your meditation when you feel it&#8217;s right to do so. This is often a beautiful practice of listening and tuning in.</p>
<h4>4. Relax Your Body as You Focus on Your Meditation</h4>
<p>Typically when we are focusing on something we tend to tighten our body. Observe this next time that you&#8217;re concentrating on something: your jaw will tighten and your shoulders will squeeze up towards your ears.</p>
<p>As you sink into your meditation keep this in mind and check in with your body every once in a while. Let your shoulders sink down your back and release any tension through your jaw and face. Lastly relax your brow and let your eyes be heavy in their sockets. Then return to your object of meditation. Observe if your meditation changes at all by relaxing your physical body.</p>
<h4>5. Return to Your Breath and Object When You Get Distracted</h4>
<p>Notice that I didn&#8217;t say &#8220;if you get distracted.&#8221; That&#8217;s because you definitely will drift off with random thoughts or get pulled away from your object of focus. In meditation distractions are almost guaranteed. Therefore it&#8217;s your opportunity to practice <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/how-to-practise-the-art-of-detached-focus-to-achieve-your-goals.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">detaching yourself</a> from feeling guilty or inadequate to continue.</p>
<p>Over time and with practice you will find it easier to stay with your object of focus. In the meantime notice when you get distracted. Pause and take a big breath in and out. Check in with your physical body and relax. Once you&#8217;re ready again return to your object of focus. Meditation is simply one long cycle of wandering and coming back to yourself.</p>
<h4>6. Journal Your Experiences</h4>
<p>When your meditation practice has ended another powerful practice is to <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/767041/writing-journal-for-a-better-self"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">jot down any experiences</a> that you felt. There may have been insights and &#8220;downloads&#8221; that you acquired during your session that you may want to record.</p>
<p>Likewise you could write about any challenges that you faced. These are great lessons that will continue to show up for you and it&#8217;s nice to keep a journal of them to see how they evolve and progress over time (and they will). Lastly you can write about what works and what doesn&#8217;t as far as picking your objects of meditation go. This way you can learn what you most associate with and feel comfortable with.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>If practicing meditation causes you to feel distracted and unsupported give focused meditation a go! With the help of an object to bring your attention to it structures your meditation time and offers guidance and support.</p>
<p>Dedicating yourself to this style of meditation will help increase your memory and promote better cognitive function. Even though any style of meditation is a powerful way of taking care of your mental health focused meditation gives your mind a tangible task with which to grow and strengthen.</p>

<p>The post <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.lifehack.org/904777/krill-oil-vs-fish-oil"">Krill Oil vs Fish Oil: Which Should You Take?</a> appeared first on <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://www.lifehack.org"">Lifehack</a>.</p> <p>Omega 3 fats are essential in our diet and there are lots of different sources and also supplements. There are pros and cons of both food sources and also <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/900101/best-fish-oil-supplement"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">supplements</a>. So I will guide you through the advantages and disadvantages of Krill oil vs fish oil supplements. I&#8217;ll also cover who needs to take these supplements and if krill oil is better than fish oil and cod liver oil.</p>

<h2>What Are Omega Fatty Acids?</h2>
<p>There are two types of fats or fatty acids that are essential and can’t be produced in our bodies. These are omega 3 and omega 6. Omega 3 can be broken down into three main forms: alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).</p>
<h3>Where Are Omega Fatty Acids Found?</h3>
<p>ALA is found in plant oils and canola oils. DHA and EPA are found in oily fish and krill oils. DHA and EPA are actually synthesized by microalgae—not by the fish—but accumulate in the tissue when they are eaten by fish and shellfish further up the food chain.</p>
<h3>Why Are Omega Fatty Acids So Important?</h3>
<p>Omega-3 and -6 fatty acids have an important structural role needed for cell membranes. They are also energy sources and are used to form signaling molecules called eicosanoids and leukotrienes.</p>
<p>There are many different prostaglandins with wide-ranging roles such as the sensation of pain regulation of pregnancy and birth and relaxation of smooth muscle.</p>
<p>Thromboxanes regulate blood clotting by causing constriction of blood vessels and the aggregation of platelets (so they stick together) which are early steps in blood clotting.</p>
<p>Leukotrienes are involved in immune function by attracting immune cells such as neutrophils to sites of inflammation. They also constrict bronchioles in the lungs and make capillary walls permeable.</p>
<p>This is thought to be because the metabolic products of omega-3 fatty acids are less inflammatory than those produced from omega 6 fatty acids. Western diets are associated with an imbalance of omega-3 -6 such that instead of levels of omega 3 being higher than 6 the reverse is more commonly seen. This is associated with an increased risk of chronic inflammation.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_8587_1"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_8587_1');"">[1]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_8587_1""></span></p>
<p>A large systemic review that combined 86 trials involving over 162 000 people looked at the effect of higher omega-3 intake versus lower omega-3 intake for at least a year. This was provided mostly by omega-3 supplements while a few trials gave oily fish. Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to reduce blood pressure and can be incorporated into your diet by eating oily fish or seeds and nuts.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_8587_2"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_8587_2');"">[2]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_8587_2""></span></p>
<p>There are three types of omega-3: those found in oily fish called EPA and DHA and the plant-based ALA.</p>
<h2>What Is Krill Oil?</h2>
<p>Krill oil is extracted from the bodies of Antarctic krill a tiny shrimp-like shellfish. Krill oil and cod liver oil are similar in that they all contain DHA and EPA.</p>
<p>Fish oil is extracted from the body of the fish and contains some vitamin A and vitamin D as well. Cod liver oil is extracted from the liver of the fish and contains higher levels of vitamin A and D.</p>
<p>High doses of vitamin A can be toxic as it is a fat-soluble vitamin that is stored by your body. This is why omega 3 supplements that contain vitamin A are to be avoided in pregnancy because high levels of this vitamin may damage the fetus.</p>
<h2>Krill Oil Vs Fish Oil</h2>
<p>Evidence surrounding krill oil is limited compared with fish oils and cod liver oils. A large portion of the EPA and DHA in krill comes in phospholipid form (whereas fish oil fatty acids are contained in triacylglycerols) which some claim has a higher rate of absorption in the body than fish oil.</p>
<p>Previously it was thought that Krill oil was more bioavailable than fish oil but there were problems with this research with regards to dosing.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_8587_3"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_8587_3');"">[3]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_8587_3""></span> More recently a randomized controlled trial in 66 people was performed to answer this question and compared the bioavailability of krill oil compared with fish oil. It found that there was no difference between blood measurements of DHA and EPA. Therefore the evidence does not support krill oil being “better” or needing lower doses than fish oil.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_8587_4"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_8587_4');"">[4]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_8587_4""></span></p>
<h4>Krill Oil Vs Fish Oil in Terms of Cholesterol</h4>
<p>A study in animals looked at gene expression after supplementation with either krill oil or fish oil. They found that fish oil upregulated (increased gene expression) the cholesterol synthesis pathway more than krill oil. Krill oil was found to upregulate (increase gene expression) more metabolic pathways than fish oil. This suggests that there might be different biological effects between krill and fish oil but more research is needed.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_8587_5"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_8587_5');"">[5]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_8587_5""></span></p>
<p>In group (meta) analysis of seven trials totaling 662 participants Krill oil supplementation was found to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides but not total cholesterol.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_8587_6"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_8587_6');"">[6]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_8587_6""></span> Whether this translates to decreased risk of cardiovascular disease needs further research.</p>
<p>However krill oil was not superior to fish oil supplementation and had very similar effects on cholesterol.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_8587_7"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_8587_7');"">[7]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_8587_7""></span></p>
<h2>Krill Oil Vs Cod Liver Oil</h2>
<p>Cod liver oil contains higher levels of vitamin D and vitamin A which may be toxic in excess. If you want to take a high dose of omega-3 this means you will also end up having higher doses of vitamin A and D. Both of these are fat-soluble vitamins that are stored by the body and can become toxic. Vitamin A supplementation should be avoided during pregnancy due to risks for the baby.</p>
<p>There is a risk that since the liver is used to filter out toxins there is the possibility that cod liver oil contains more environmental contaminants than fish oil or krill oil.</p>
<h3>Are There Risks With Krill Oil?</h3>
<p>Less research has been performed on krill oil and although no side effects have been reported the safe maximum dose of natural astaxanthin has not been determined.</p>
<p>Krill make up a vital part of the Antarctic food chain and a huge number of species higher up the food chain depend on them. Fishing krill has the potential to catastrophically destabilize this important food chain. Therefore fish oils are more sustainable than krill oil.</p>
<h3>Why Is Krill Oil Red?</h3>
<p>The deep red color of krill oil is due to a compound called astaxanthin found in krill. Astaxanthin is also found in other more sustainable sources such as red trout and wild salmon. Astaxanthin is a carotenoid antioxidant compound that mops up harmful free radicals.</p>
<h2>When to Take Omega-3 Supplement</h2>
<p>A large review of 86 trials combined—totaling over 162 000 people—looked to see what the effect of increased omega-3 had on cardiovascular risk. Increasing ALA made no significant difference to blood clots of the coronary arteries supplying the heart (coronary events) but slightly reduced cardiovascular events (diseases related to blood vessels such as clots and rhythm problems) while EPA and DHA reduced serum triglycerides and also reduced the risk of coronary <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/fight-heart-disease-with-these-heart-healthy-foods.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">heart disease</a> such as heart attacks.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_8587_8"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_8587_8');"">[8]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_8587_8""></span></p>
<p>They found that EPA and DHA decreased triglycerides (a type of fat) by about 15% and reduced the risk of coronary artery death and coronary events which are illnesses of arteries supplying the heart. However they did not affect cardiovascular events (e.g. heart irregularities).<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_8587_9"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_8587_9');"">[9]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_8587_9""></span></p>
<p>While increasing ALA made no significant difference to coronary events it slightly reduced cardiovascular events. This means that the three combined (ALA and DHA combined) may reduce the risk of coronary but the effects are small.</p>
<p>One of the ways of decreasing your risk of cardiovascular disease is by lowering your cholesterol—reducing saturated fats in your diet and eating ALA omega-3 (e.g. from walnuts). A grouped meta-analysis has not found any link between omega-3 and dementia but more information is needed to see if omega-3 can prevent cognitive decline.<sup id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_8587_10"" class=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text"" onclick=""footnote_moveToAnchor('footnote_plugin_reference_8587_10');"">[10]</sup><span class=""footnote_tooltip"" id=""footnote_plugin_tooltip_text_8587_10""></span></p>
<p>Overall if you aren’t pregnant or intending to get pregnant then omega 3 supplements are probably unlikely to do you harm and might benefit your long-term cardiovascular risk. It isn’t possible to tell the difference in general between eating enough omega-3 in your diet versus supplementing but whole foods have other benefits as well.</p>
<p>Omega-3 supplements often have high levels of vitamin A which can be harmful in pregnancy. Therefore you should avoid supplementing or choose a pregnancy-safe version.</p>
<p>If you are vegan you may consider taking an omega-3 supplement made from algae or seaweed but these are unregulated and can contain significant quantities of iodine which can be harmful. Therefore to optimize your diet. There are concerns that part of the benefit of omega-3 is from a whole food effect that isn’t seen with taking a supplement instead.</p>
<h2>Tips on How to Get Enough Omega-3 in Your Diet</h2>
<ul>
<li>Aim to have oily fish twice a week if you aren’t pregnant or once a week if you are as the benefit of omega-3 has to be offset by the risk of contamination with heavy metals.</li>
<li>Algae and seaweed are the only plant-based sources of EPA and DHA but ALA can be converted in your body into EPA and DHA.</li>
<li>Vegan sources of omega-3 are chia seeds such as rapeseed. To meet the current guidance for omega-3 you would need to eat about a tablespoon of chia or ground linseeds or two tablespoons of hemp seeds or six walnut halves a day.</li>
<li>Algae oil is an alternative to fish oil which makes it an attractive option for vegetarians. But while algae oils do contain large amounts of DHA most don’t contain any EPA fatty acids at all.</li>
</ul>
<h2>In Summary</h2>
<p>Krill oil supplements appear to be safe and as effective as fish oil. They also have the bonus of containing the antioxidant astaxanthin.</p>
<p>However harvesting krill is not sustainable and there are risks regarding destabilizing the Antarctic food chain. Instead aim to include foods rich in omega-3 in your diet to benefit from the “whole food effect ” and eat foods that are naturally rich in carotenoids and lobster. Avoid taking high doses of cod liver oil and avoid it completely during pregnancy due to the risk of vitamin A.</p>

What are lambda functions in Python? How to use lambda Functions in Python? Example of Lambda Function in python Use of Lambda Function in python you'll learn about the anonymous function also known as lambda functions. You'll learn what they are their syntax and how to use them (with examples). What are lambda functions in Python? an anonymous function is a that is defined without a name. While normal functions are defined using the anonymous functions are defined using the anonymous functions are also called lambda functions. How to use lambda Functions in Python? A lambda function in python has the following syntax. Lambda functions can have any number of arguments but only one expression. The expression is evaluated and returned. Lambda functions can be used wherever function objects are required. Example of Lambda Function in python Here is an example of lambda function that doubles the input value. # Program to show the use of lambda functions
double = lambda x: x * 2

print(double(5)) is the expression that gets evaluated and returned. This function has no name. It returns a function object which is assigned to the identifier . We can now call it as a normal function. The statement We use lambda functions when we require a nameless function for a short period of time. we generally use it as an argument to a higher-order function (a function that takes in other functions as ). Lambda functions are used along with built-in functions like function in Python takes in a function and a list as arguments. The function is called with all the items in the list and a new list is returned which contains items for which the function evaluates to Here is an example use of function to filter out only even numbers from a list. # Program to filter out only the even items from a list
my_list = [1 12]

new_list = list(filter(lambda x: (x%2 == 0) function in Python takes in a function and a list. The function is called with all the items in the list and a new list is returned which contains items returned by that function for each item. Here is an example use of function to double all the items in a list. # Program to double each item in a list using map()

my_list = [1 12]

For the description of other ESP32-PICO-KIT versions This particular description covers ESP32-PICO-KIT V4 and V4.1. The difference is the upgraded USB-UART bridge from CP2102 in V4 with up to 1 Mbps transfer rates to CP2102N in V4.1 with up to 3 Mbps transfer rates. USB 2.0 A to Micro B cable You can skip the introduction sections and go directly to Section ESP32-PICO-KIT is an ESP32-based mini development board produced by The core of this board is ESP32-PICO-D4 - a System-in-Package (SiP) module with complete Wi-Fi and Bluetooth functionalities. Compared to other ESP32 modules ESP32-PICO-D4 integrates the following peripheral components in one single package which otherwise would need to be installed separately: This setup reduces the costs of additional external components as well as the cost of assembly and testing and also increases the overall usability of the product. The development board features a USB-UART Bridge circuit which allows developers to connect the board to a computer’s USB port for flashing and debugging. All the IO signals and system power on ESP32-PICO-D4 are led out to two rows of 20 x 0.1” header pads on both sides of the development board for easy access. For compatibility with Dupont wires 2 x 17 header pads are populated with two rows of male pin headers. The remaining 2 x 3 header pads beside the antenna are not populated. These pads may be populated later by the user if required. The 2 x 3 pads not populated with pin headers are connected to the flash memory embedded in the ESP32-PICO-D4 SiP module. For more details see module’s datasheet in ESP32-PICO-KIT comes with male headers by default. The block diagram below shows the main components of ESP32-PICO-KIT and their interconnections. The following figure and the table below describe the key components and controls of the ESP32-PICO-KIT board. Below is the description of the items identified in the figure starting from the top left corner and going clockwise. Standard ESP32-PICO-D4 module soldered to the ESP32-PICO-KIT board. The complete ESP32 system on a chip (ESP32 SoC) has been integrated into the SiP module requiring only an external antenna with LC matching network and a pull-up resistor for EN signals to function properly. 5V-to-3.3V Low dropout voltage regulator (LDO).

Power supply for the board as well as the communication interface between a computer and the board. This red LED turns on when power is supplied to the board. For details All the pins on ESP32-PICO-D4 are broken out to pin headers. You can program ESP32 to enable multiple functions initiates Firmware Download mode for downloading firmware through the serial port. There are three mutually exclusive ways to provide power to the board: The power supply must be provided using one and only one of the options above otherwise the board and/or the power supply source can be damaged. The two tables below provide the of I/O header pins on both sides of the board .

While there’s certainly a number of games for the system that are still as entertaining in 2021 as they were in the 80s and 90s the hardware itself is another story entirely. Having to squint at the unlit display with its somewhat nauseating green tint certainly takes away from the experience of hunting down Pokémon. Which is precisely why [The Poor Student Hobbyist] decided to take an original Game Boy and replace its internals with more modern hardware in the form of a Game Boy Advance (GBA) SP motherboard and aftermarket IPS LCD panel. The backwards compatibility mode of the GBA allows him to play those classic Game Boy and Game Boy Color games from their original cartridges while the IPS display brings them to life in a way never before possible. Relocating the cartridge connector took several attempts. this might seem like a relatively simple project. After all the GBA SP was much smaller than its predecessors so there should be plenty of room inside the relatively cavernous DMG-01 case for the transplanted hardware. But [The Poor Student Hobbyist] made things quite a bit harder on himself by deciding early on that there would be no external signs that the Game Boy had been modified; beyond the wildly improved screen That meant deleting the GBA’s shoulder buttons though since the goal was always to play older games that predated their addition to the system that wasn’t really a problem. The GBA’s larger and wider screen is still intact albeit hidden behind the Game Boy’s original bezel. It turns out the image isn’t exactly centered on the physical display so [The Poor Student Hobbyist] came up with a 3D printed adapter to mount it with a slight offset. The adapter also allows the small tactile switch that controls the screen brightness to be mounted where the “Contrast” wheel used to go. An incredible amount of thought and effort went into making the final result look as close to stock as possible [The Poor Student Hobbyist] did a phenomenal job of documenting it for others who might want to make similar modifications. Even if you’re not in the market for a rejuvenated Game Boy it’s worth browsing through the build log to marvel at the passion that went into this project. Some would argue [The Poor Student Hobbyist] should have just put a Raspberry Pi into a Game Boy case but where’s the fun in that? Sure it might have been a somewhat better Bitcoin miner but there’s something to be said for playing classic games on real hardware. The Russian Woodpecker: Official Bird Of The Cold War Nests In Giant Antenna Original Game Boy Powered Up With GBA Motherboard I think we can all agree this is a very cool hack without denigrating the hardy DMG-01. What it lacks in a backlight it makes up for in mods and just general build quality. It’s also incredibly cheap to mod and repair. New shells are very inexpensive. Removing the GBA support and only using the Z80 on the motherboard is like cutting the balls off a bull putting it in a dress and calling it a “hack”. Technically true I guess. The same IPS screen can be used with a Gameboy color which might have been easier to fit in the DMG case with less waste. If you’d actually looked at the person’s project you’d know he started with the GBC but realized it would have been much more difficult. I probably would have just played it on the GBA with its somewhat nauseating green tint don’t you be dissin’ the Data General ONE.

Video: Python Local and Global Variables a variable declared outside of the function or in global scope is known as a global variable. This means that a global variable can be accessed inside or outside of the function. Let's see an example of how a global variable is created in Python. Example 1: Create a Global Variable x = ""global""

def foo():
    print(""x inside:"" as a global variable and defined a which will print the value of What if you want to change the value of x = ""global""

def foo():
    x = x * 2
    print(x)

foo() UnboundLocalError: local variable 'x' referenced before assignment The output shows an error because Python treats A variable declared inside the function's body or in the local scope is known as a local variable. Example 2: Accessing local variable outside the scope def foo():
    y = ""local""


foo()
print(y) NameError: name 'y' is not defined The output shows an error because we are trying to access a local variable in a global scope whereas the local variable only works inside Let's see an example on how a local variable is created in Python. Example 3: Create a Local Variable we declare a variable inside the function to create a local variable. def foo():
    y = ""local""
    print(y)

foo() Let's take a look at the was a global variable and we wanted to modify we will show how to use global variables and local variables in the same code. Example 4: Using Global and Local variables in the same code x = ""global ""

def foo():

    y = ""local""
    x = x * 2
    print(x)
    print(y)

foo() as a local variable in the we print the value of local variable Example 5: Global variable and Local variable with same name x = 5

def foo():
    x = 10
    print(""local x:"" we used the same name for both global variable and local variable. We get a different result when we print the same variable because the variable is declared in both scopes i.e. the local scope inside When we print the variable inside . This is called the local scope of the variable. when we print the variable outside the . This is called the global scope of the variable. Nonlocal variables are used in nested functions whose local scope is not defined. This means that the variable can be neither in the local nor the global scope. Let's see an example of how a nonlocal variable is used in Python. Example 6: Create a nonlocal variable def outer():

Set up the tools Step 4. Set up the environment variables Step 9. Flash onto the Device This guide shows how to get started with the ESP32-Ethernet-Kit development board and also provides information about its functionality and configuration options. is an Ethernet-to-Wi-Fi development board that enables Ethernet devices to be interconnected over Wi-Fi. At the same time to provide more flexible power supply options the ESP32-Ethernet-Kit also supports power over Ethernet (PoE). ESP32-Ethernet-Kit V1.2 Overview (click to enlarge) USB 2.0 A to Micro B Cable You can skip the introduction sections and go directly to Section ESP32-Ethernet-Kit is an ESP32-based development board produced by It consists of two development boards the Ethernet board A and the PoE board B. The contains Bluetooth/Wi-Fi dual-mode ESP32-WROVER-E module and IP101GRI a Single Port 10/100 Fast Ethernet Transceiver (PHY). The provides power over Ethernet functionality. The A board can work independently without the board B installed. For the application loading and monitoring the Ethernet board (A) also features FTDI FT2232H chip - an advanced multi-interface USB bridge. This chip enables to use JTAG for direct debugging of ESP32 through the USB interface without a separate JTAG debugger. The block diagram below shows the main components of ESP32-Ethernet-Kit and their interconnections. ESP32-Ethernet-Kit block diagram (click to enlarge) The following figures and tables describe the key components and controls of the ESP32-Ethernet-Kit. ESP32-Ethernet-Kit - Ethernet board (A) layout (click to enlarge) The table below provides description starting from the picture’s top right corner and going clockwise. This ESP32 module features 64-Mbit PSRAM for flexible extended storage and data processing capabilities. Five unpopulated through-hole solder pads to provide access to selected GPIOs of ESP32. For details A 4-bit DIP switch used to configure the functionality of selected GPIOs of ESP32. For details see Two LEDs to show the status of UART transmission. The FT2232H chip serves as a multi-protocol USB-to-serial bridge which can be programmed and controlled via USB to provide communication with ESP32. FT2232H also features USB-to-JTAG interface which is available on channel A of the chip while USB-to-serial is on channel B. The FT2232H chip enhances user-friendliness in terms of application development and debugging. See ESP32-Ethernet-Kit V1.2 Ethernet board (A) schematic USB interface. Power supply for the board as well as the communication interface between a computer and the board. Power On/Off Switch. Toggling the switch to The 5V power supply interface can be more convenient when the board is operating autonomously (not connected to a computer). This red LED turns on when power is supplied to the board either from USB or 5V Input. Provided DC 5 V to 3.3 V conversion output current up to 2 A. A pair male and female header pins for mounting the The physical layer (PHY) connection to the Ethernet cable is implemented using the chip. The connection between PHY and ESP32 is done through the reduced media-independent interface (RMII) a variant of the media-independent interface standard. The PHY supports the IEEE 802.3/802.3u standard of 10/100 Mbps. The Magnetics are part of the Ethernet specification to protect against faults and transients including rejection of common mode signals between the transceiver IC and the cable. The magnetics also provide galvanic isolation between the transceiver and the Ethernet device. Two LEDs (green and red) that respectively indicate the “Link” and “Activity” statuses of the PHY. initiates Firmware Download mode for downloading firmware through the serial port. This header provides six unpopulated through-hole solder pads connected to spare GPIOs of ESP32. For details Automatic firmware download is supported. If following steps and using software described in Section users don’t need to do any operation with BOOT button or EN button. This board coverts power delivered over the Ethernet cable (PoE) to provide a power supply for the Ethernet board (A). The main components of the PoE board (B) are shown on the block diagram under The PoE board (B) has the following features: To take advantage of the PoE functionality the of the Ethernet board (A) should be connected with an Ethernet cable to a switch that supports PoE. When the Ethernet board (A) detects 5 V power output from the PoE board (B) the USB power will be automatically cut off. ESP32-Ethernet-Kit - PoE board (B) layout (click to enlarge) Four female (left) and four male (right) header pins for connecting the PoE board (B) to . The pins on the left accept power coming from a PoE switch. The pins on the right deliver 5 V power supply to the  Ethernet board (A). Optional power supply (26.6 ~ 54 V) to the PoE board (B). This section describes options to configure the ESP32-Ethernet-Kit hardware. this DIP switch is routing listed GPIOs to FT2232H to provide JTAG functionality. When in Off position the GPIOs may be used for other purposes. The ethernet MAC and PHY under RMII working mode need a common 50 MHz reference clock (i.e. RMII clock) that can be provided either externally or generated from internal ESP32 APLL (not recommended). For additional information on the RMII clock selection ESP32-Ethernet-Kit V1.2 Ethernet board (A) schematic RMII Clock Sourced Externally by PHY the ESP32-Ethernet-Kit is configured to provide RMII clock for the IP101GRI PHY’s 50M_CLKO output. The clock signal is generated by the frequency multiplication of 25 MHz crystal connected to the PHY. For details please see the figure below. Please note that the PHY is reset on power up by pulling the RESET_N signal down with a resistor. ESP32 should assert RESET_N high with GPIO5 to enable PHY. Only this can ensure the power-up of system. Otherwise ESP32 may enter download mode (when the clock signal of REF_CLK_50M is at a high logic level during the GPIO0 power-up sampling phase). RMII Clock Sourced Internally from ESP32’s APLL Another option is to source the RMII Clock from internal ESP32 APLL see figure below. The clock signal coming from GPIO0 is first inverted to account for transmission line delay and then supplied to the PHY. RMII Clock from ESP Internal APLL users need to remove or add some RC components on the board. For details please refer to ESP32-Ethernet-Kit V1.2 Ethernet board (A) schematic location D2. Please note that if the APLL is already used for other purposes (e.g. I2S peripheral) then you have no choice but use an external RMII clock. This section describes allocation of ESP32 GPIOs to specific interfaces or functions of the ESP32-Ethernet-Kit. The allocation of the ESP32 (MAC) pins to IP101GRI (PHY) is shown in the table below. Implementation of ESP32-Ethernet-Kit defaults to Reduced Media-Independent Interface (RMII). The allocation of all pins under the ESP32’s is fixed and cannot be changed either through IO MUX or GPIO Matrix. REF_CLK can only be selected from GPIO0 GPIO16 or GPIO17 and it can not be changed through GPIO Matrix. This header exposes some GPIOs that are not used elsewhere on the ESP32-Ethernet-Kit. This header contains GPIOs that may be used for other purposes depending on scenarios described in column “Comments”. The ESP32 pins GPIO16 and GPIO17 are not broken out to the ESP32-WROVER-E module and therefore not available for use. If you need to use these pins please solder a module without PSRAM memory inside e.g. the ESP32-WROOM-32D or ESP32-SOLO-1. Functionality depends on the settings of the To prevent the power-on state of the GPIO0 from being affected by the clock output on the PHY side the RESET_N signal to PHY defaults to low turning the clock output off. After power-on you can control RESET_N with GPIO5 to turn the clock output on. See also RMII Clock Sourced Externally by PHY . For PHYs that cannot turn off the clock output through RESET_N it is recommended to use a crystal module that can be disabled/enabled externally. Similarly like when using RESET_N the oscillator module should be disabled by default and turned on by ESP32 after power-up. For a reference design please see ESP32-Ethernet-Kit V1.2 Ethernet board (A) schematic The ESP32 pins GPIO16 and GPIO17 are not broken out to the ESP32-WROVER-E module and therefore not available for use. If you need to use these pins please solder a module without PSRAM memory inside e.g. the ESP32-WROOM-32D or ESP32-SOLO-1. please make sure that the board is in good condition with no obvious signs of damage. to its default position by turning all the switches to To simplify flashing and testing of the application do not input extra signals to the board headers. but do not connect external power to it. to the PC with a USB cable. will quickly help you set up the development environment and then flash an example project onto your board.

Are you constantly overwhelmed and can’t seem to quite make your deadlines? Is the amount of time you’re able to concentrate diminishing? you’re lacking focus which is holding you back from your full potential. Learning to improve your focus is how you break free from the never-ending cycle. You’re not always going to be able to be 100% focused but learning how to focus will help you meet your goals and enable you to conquer any task. Below you’ll learn how to focus so you can train your brain and know exactly what needs to get done. It’s going to be difficult to maintain focus when your body and soul are not in line with . Every day can seem like it’s on repeat and filled with eternal dread. When your heart isn’t in it you aren’t able to hit a and maintain concentration for long periods. may be causing you to lose focus throughout the day. If this sounds like you it might be time to contemplate taking a new direction in life. Finding a new path in life can be frightening. The payoff of facing your fears is being able to focus more for longer periods while being able to spend time on what you love. Try new things and find out what makes your clock tick. One of the best ways to discover your drive and purpose is to use the ‘ ‘. This form of self-questioning will help you get to the core of what you want out of life. Let’s say your initial want is to “make more money.” Why do you want to make more money? “Because I want to buy a big house.” Why do you want a big house? “Because living in a big house is comfortable” Why does only a big house make you comfortable? “Because I have a big family with a wife and three kids; we need a big house for everyone.” Why do you want a big house for everyone to live in? “Because I want them to live in a comfortable place.” “Because I love my family and I want them to be happy.” Can you now see the clear difference between the initial want and the true purpose at the end? In this example you thought you wanted more money; but in reality what you truly want is for your family to be happy. While making more money and getting a big house could do that how you treat your family and the time you spend with them are key elements too. 4 Step Guide to Creating More Time Out of a Busy Schedule Losing focus when juggling multiple assignments? Start by learning you won’t end up having to deal with a deadline you brushed off until the last minute. Not every task requires the same attention. Working on your will help you split up your time intelligently for each assignment. Spending your time wisely each day will let you focus intensely on the task at hand not letting a moment be wasted.

Even when you’re working from home distractions are everywhere. Figure out which type of distraction you’re dealing with so you can learn are your thoughts and emotions and include things like daydreaming and worries. When you start do some breathing exercises to relax your mind. You’ll find that taking a short break allows your mind to reset and unwind. happen outside of your mind. Typical external distractions include checking social media feeds It’s impossible to focus if you’re constantly interrupted. That’s why it’s so important that you do everything you can to minimize the number of distractions in your life — particularly when you’re trying to work. If you need to focus on a task then make sure your external environment enables you to focus. This might mean moving to a coffee shop for an hour instead of trying to work in an open-plan office with lots of colleagues chatting and asking you questions. then you may want to create a ‘do not disturb’ policy to help prevent your family members from entering your office space and interrupting you while you’re on Zoom calls or focusing on writing project documentation etc. If you have an open-door policy you’ll have countless distractions that are bound to impact the amount and quality of work you accomplish. putting on music that helps you to focus is also a way to take control of your external environment. Try this Ultimate List of Deep Focus Music for Productive Work You can learn more about getting rid of external distractions here: free guide End Distraction And Find Your Focus.

While there’s certainly a number of games for the system that are still as entertaining in 2021 as they were in the 80s and 90s the hardware itself is another story entirely. Having to squint at the unlit display with its somewhat nauseating green tint certainly takes away from the experience of hunting down Pokémon. Which is precisely why [The Poor Student Hobbyist] decided to take an original Game Boy and replace its internals with more modern hardware in the form of a Game Boy Advance (GBA) SP motherboard and aftermarket IPS LCD panel. The backwards compatibility mode of the GBA allows him to play those classic Game Boy and Game Boy Color games from their original cartridges while the IPS display brings them to life in a way never before possible. Relocating the cartridge connector took several attempts. this might seem like a relatively simple project. After all the GBA SP was much smaller than its predecessors so there should be plenty of room inside the relatively cavernous DMG-01 case for the transplanted hardware. But [The Poor Student Hobbyist] made things quite a bit harder on himself by deciding early on that there would be no external signs that the Game Boy had been modified; beyond the wildly improved screen That meant deleting the GBA’s shoulder buttons though since the goal was always to play older games that predated their addition to the system that wasn’t really a problem. The GBA’s larger and wider screen is still intact albeit hidden behind the Game Boy’s original bezel. It turns out the image isn’t exactly centered on the physical display so [The Poor Student Hobbyist] came up with a 3D printed adapter to mount it with a slight offset. The adapter also allows the small tactile switch that controls the screen brightness to be mounted where the “Contrast” wheel used to go. An incredible amount of thought and effort went into making the final result look as close to stock as possible [The Poor Student Hobbyist] did a phenomenal job of documenting it for others who might want to make similar modifications. Even if you’re not in the market for a rejuvenated Game Boy it’s worth browsing through the build log to marvel at the passion that went into this project. Some would argue [The Poor Student Hobbyist] should have just put a Raspberry Pi into a Game Boy case but where’s the fun in that? Sure it might have been a somewhat better Bitcoin miner but there’s something to be said for playing classic games on real hardware. The Russian Woodpecker: Official Bird Of The Cold War Nests In Giant Antenna Original Game Boy Powered Up With GBA Motherboard I think we can all agree this is a very cool hack without denigrating the hardy DMG-01. What it lacks in a backlight it makes up for in mods and just general build quality. It’s also incredibly cheap to mod and repair. New shells are very inexpensive. Removing the GBA support and only using the Z80 on the motherboard is like cutting the balls off a bull putting it in a dress and calling it a “hack”. Technically true I guess. The same IPS screen can be used with a Gameboy color which might have been easier to fit in the DMG case with less waste. If you’d actually looked at the person’s project you’d know he started with the GBC but realized it would have been much more difficult. I probably would have just played it on the GBA with its somewhat nauseating green tint don’t you be dissin’ the Data General ONE.

It is used to create a global variable and make changes to the variable in a local context. When we create a variable inside a function it is local by default. When we define a variable outside of a function it is global by default. You don't have to use keyword to read and write a global variable inside a function. keyword outside a function has no effect. Example 1: Accessing global Variable From Inside a Function c = 1 # global variable

def add():
    print(c)

add() When we run the above program we may have some scenarios where we need to modify the global variable from inside a function. Example 2: Modifying Global Variable From Inside the Function c = 1 # global variable
    
def add():
    c = c + 2 # increment c by 2
    print(c)

add() When we run the above program the output shows an error: UnboundLocalError: local variable 'c' referenced before assignment This is because we can only access the global variable but cannot modify it from inside the function. The solution for this is to use the Example 3: Changing Global Variable From Inside a Function using global c = 0 # global variable

def add():
    global c
    c = c + 2 # increment by 2
    print(""Inside add():"" When we run the above program as a global keyword inside the we print the global variable change also occurred on the global variable outside the function we create a single module to hold global variables and share information across Python modules within the same program.

Home Workouts With No Equipment Needed Intermittent Fasting (Recommended For Losing Weight) Here’re some general tips for working out and exercising: and a few minutes warming down as you bring your exercise session to an end. Warm ups and warm downs might not be sexy but they’ll reduce your chance of injury thus enabling you to exercise more. Gradually increase your amount of exercise if you set yourself a target of running a marathon in six months (through daily runs) so you’d be ready to run and you’d be ready to cross the finishing line. Eat a snack immediately after your workout within 15 minutes of wrapping up your exercise routine. This can help optimize the healing of the tiny muscle injuries that normally occur while you exercise. Protein is also satiating which means you’ll be able to resist the temptation to eat junk food later on! drinking plenty of fluids (preferably water) but the key benefits when it comes to your fitness are: keeping your body at peak performance delivering nutrients to your body and regulating your body temperature. If you don’t like drinking lots of plain water consider drinking fresh fruit juices. Home Workouts With No Equipment Needed Using this as a stand-alone workout plan can also work too in many ways: You’ll not have to spend money on memberships. Also you can realistically spend little to no money at all in doing this. It saves you a considerable amount of time. No need to drive or bike to your local gym. Also because home exercises don’t require much setup you’ll be focusing on moving more rather than putting on weights or getting machines set up to exercise. meaning no waiting for machines. You focus more on the workout itself. — 12 best at-home workouts that you can use for strength and mobility. — Ways to build six-pack abs from the comfort of your couch! — 6 fat burning exercises you can do from home. 13 Best Fitness Apps to Use in the Comfort of Your Home to keep track of your fitness progress at home. Muscle-building focuses more on heavier lifting exercises rather than worrying about how many reps you are doing. These sorts of exercises are best done with a trainer or someone who has experience in building muscle as they’ll be able to guide and spot you too so you don’t overexert yourself. This is ideal because the types of exercises that you’ll be doing rely on lifting and swinging. Getting into specifics rear delt flys and general strength training are some of the many exercises that you could be doing. How working on specific muscle groups can help you in achieving your fitness goals can work in several ways depending on what those goals are. For example muscle exercises can help with: Losing weight since muscles require calories and fat in order to grow. If you’re strengthening your muscles they’re going to naturally eat away at fat build-up. Working specific muscles can also ensure your muscles can keep you locked and supported in specific positions. For example building back muscles can lead to a straight spine when sitting down. This ensures you mitigate back pain in the future. Set expectations before getting into it. Building your ideal dream body isn’t something that’ll be achieved in three months. The two big factors to easier building muscles and fat loss are your genetic blueprint and your work ethic. For this reason an Olympic athlete is going to have an easier time building muscle and burning fat than someone who sits around all day. pay more attention to your protein intake over the number of calories it’s not out of the ordinary to be taking in 100 grams or more of protein. Remember that protein doesn’t have to come from meat. Taking protein shakes over the course of the day can help to cover a good portion of protein intake for the day.

Like the muscle-focused exercises the upside to these exercises is you’re focusing on the exercises that burn more fat while also improving your overall endurance too. Some of the common exercises that are done are cardio like jogging or biking (either on machines or out and about town) as well as For those who are not familiar with HIIT it’s a series of exercises that are done in intervals and are at high intensity. What this means is that you’re doing short bursts of exercises within a period of time. Think of doing several jumping jacks before doing a series of sit-ups before taking a short break and starting different or the same exercises again.

1620762698.722203,18166413,https://hackaday.com/author/tomnardi/,"Original Game Boy Powered Up With GBA Motherboard The Game Boy DMG-01 is about as iconic as a piece of consumer electronics can get it hasn’t exactly aged well. While there’s certainly a number of games for the system that are still as entertaining in 2021 as they were in the 80s and 90s the hardware itself is another story entirely. Having to squint at the unlit display with its somewhat nauseating green tint certainly takes away from the experience of hunting down Pokémon. Which is precisely why [The Poor Student Hobbyist] decided to take an original Game Boy and replace its internals with more modern hardware in the form of a Game Boy Advance (GBA) SP motherboard and aftermarket IPS LCD panel. The backwards compatibility mode of the GBA allows him to play those classic Game Boy and Game Boy Color games from their original cartridges while the IPS display brings them to life in a way never before possible. Relocating the cartridge connector took several attempts. this might seem like a relatively simple project. After all the GBA SP was much smaller than its predecessors so there should be plenty of room inside the relatively cavernous DMG-01 case for the transplanted hardware. But [The Poor Student Hobbyist] made things quite a bit harder on himself by deciding early on that there would be no external signs that the Game Boy had been modified; beyond the wildly improved screen That meant deleting the GBA’s shoulder buttons though since the goal was always to play older games that predated their addition to the system that wasn’t really a problem. The GBA’s larger and wider screen is still intact albeit hidden behind the Game Boy’s original bezel. It turns out the image isn’t exactly centered on the physical display so [The Poor Student Hobbyist] came up with a 3D printed adapter to mount it with a slight offset. The adapter also allows the small tactile switch that controls the screen brightness to be mounted where the “Contrast” wheel used to go. An incredible amount of thought and effort went into making the final result look as close to stock as possible [The Poor Student Hobbyist] did a phenomenal job of documenting it for others who might want to make similar modifications. Even if you’re not in the market for a rejuvenated Game Boy it’s worth browsing through the build log to marvel at the passion that went into this project. Some would argue [The Poor Student Hobbyist] should have just put a Raspberry Pi into a Game Boy case but where’s the fun in that? Sure it might have been a somewhat better Bitcoin miner but there’s something to be said for playing classic games on real hardware. For Game Boy Gets Online Multiplayer the Game Boy version of is notable for being the first game to support multiplayer via the so-called “Game Link Cable” accessory. So it’s fitting that now playable with others over the Internet thanks to an open source USB adapter from [stacksmashing] As explained in the video below the adapter is essentially just a Raspberry Pi Pico paired with some level shifters so that it can talk to the Game Boy’s link port. That said the custom PCB does implement some very clever edge connectors that let you plug it right into the Link Cable for the original “brick” Game Boy as well as the later Color and Advance variants. This keeps you from having to cut up a Link Cable just to get a male end which is what [stacksmashing] had to do during the prototyping phase. The DIY breadboard approach works as well. the hardware is only one half of the equation. There’s also an open source software stack which includes a Python server and WebUSB frontend that handles communicating with the Game Boy and connecting players. While the original game only supported a two person head-to-head mode the relatively simplistic nature of the multiplayer gameplay allowed [stacksmashing] to expand that to an arbitrary number of players with his code. The core rules haven’t changed and each client Game Boy still thinks it’s in a two player match but the web interface will show the progress of other players and who ends up on top at the end. this isn’t some transparent Link Cable to TCP/IP solution. While something like that could potentially be possible with the hardware the software [stacksmashing] has put together only works for . So if you want to battle Pokemon over the net you’ll have to do your own reverse engineering (or at least wait for somebody else to inevitably do it). The Link Cable port on the Game Boy especially on the later versions of the hardware is a surprisingly versatile interface capable of much more than just multiplayer gaming . While we’re certainly keen to see [stacksmashing] develop this project farther we’re equally excited to see the non-gaming applications of such an easy to use computer interface for the iconic handheld. For Game Boy Gets Online Multiplayer” Pocket Sized Wii Sets The Bar For Portable Builds Over the last few years we’ve seen several projects that convert Nintendo’s Wii into a handheld console by way of a “trimming” wherein the system’s motherboard is literally cut down to a fraction of its original size. This is made possible due to the fact that the majority of the console’s critical components were physically arranged in a tight grouping on the PCB. While it might not be the smallest one we’ve ever seen Wii SPii by [StonedEdge] is certainly in the running for the most technically impressive It took [StonedEdge] the better part of a year to go from the first early 3D printed case concepts to the fully functional device but we’d say it was certainly time well spent. The general look of the portable is strongly inspired by Nintendo’s own GameBoy Advance SP albeit with additional buttons and control sticks. In terms of software the system is not only able to run Wii and Gamecube game ISOs stored on its SD card but also several decades worth of classic titles through the various console emulators available for the system. The Wii SPii makes use of a particularly difficult variation of the Wii miniaturization concept known as the OMEGA trim and is supported by a custom PCB that’s responsible for things like power management and audio output. As it was never designed to be particularly energy efficient the trimmed Wii motherboard will deplete the system’s dual 18650 cells in about two and a half hours but at least you’ll be able to get charged back up quickly thanks to USB-C PD support. All of the hardware fits inside the custom designed case which was CNC milled from acrylic and then sandblasted to achieve that gorgeous frosted look. [StonedEdge] says the Wii SPii was inspired by the work of accomplished smallerizer [GMan] and even uses some of the open source code he developed for the audio and power management systems. In fact given its lengthy list of acknowledgements this project could even be considered something of a community affair. Just a few years after we marveled at a functional Wii being crammed into an Altoids tin it’s truly inspiring to see what this dedicated group of console modders has been able to accomplish by working together. “Pocket Sized Wii Sets The Bar For Portable Builds” SpaceX Drops The Ball On Catching Fairings You don’t have to look very hard to find another rousing success by SpaceX. It’s a company defined by big and bold moves and when something goes right they make sure you know about it. From launching a Tesla into deep space to the captivating test flights of their next-generation Starship spacecraft the private company has turned high-stakes aerospace research and development into a public event. A cult of personality has developed around SpaceX’s outlandish CEO Elon Musk and so long as he’s at the helm we can expect bigger and brighter spectacles as he directs the company towards its ultimate goal of putting humans on Mars. things don’t always go right for SpaceX. While setbacks are inevitable in aerospace the company has had a few particularly embarrassing failures that could be directly attributed to their rapid development pace or even operational inexperience. A perfect example is the loss of the Israeli AMOS-6 satellite during a static fire of the Falcon 9’s engines on the launch pad in 2016 as industry experts questioned why the spacecraft had even been mounted to the rocket before it had passed its pre-flight checks. Since that costly mistake the company has waited until all engine tests have been completed before attaching the customer’s payload. SpaceX’s concept art for propulsive landing But sometimes the failure isn’t so much a technical problem as an inability for the company to achieve their own lofty goals. Occasionally one of Musk’s grand ideas ends up being too complex or expensive to put into practice. For instance despite spending several years and untold amounts of money perfecting the technology involved propulsive landings for the Crew Dragon were nixed before the idea could ever fully be tested. NASA was reportedly uncomfortable with what they saw as an unnecessary risk compared to the more traditional ocean splashdown under parachutes; it would have been an impressive sight to be sure but it didn’t offer a substantive benefit over the simpler approach. A similar fate recently befell SpaceX’s twin fairing recovery ships which were quietly retired in April. These vessels were designed to catch the Falcon’s school bus sized payload fairings as they drifted down back to Earth using massive nets suspended over their decks the process turned out to be more difficult than expected. More importantly it apparently wasn’t even necessary in the first place. “SpaceX Drops The Ball On Catching Fairings” Putting An Ultra-Tiny Linux Board In A Phone Charger…Eventually a “drop box” is a device that can be covertly installed at a target location and phone home over the Internet providing a back door into what might be an otherwise secure network. We’ve seen both commercial and DIY versions of this concept and as you might expect one of the main goals is to make the device look as inconspicuous as possible. Which is why [Walker] is hoping to build one into a standard USB wall charger This project is still in the early stages but we like what we see so far. [Walker] aims to make this a 100% free and open source device starting from the tools he’s using to produce the CAD files all the way up to the firmware the final hardware will run. With none of the currently available single-board computers (SBCs) meeting his list of requirements the first step is to build a miniature Linux machine that’s got enough processing power to run useful security tools locally. Obviously such a board would be of great interest to the larger hacker and maker community. The RTL8188CUS is likely to get integrated later on. [Walker] has decided on his primary components and is working on a larger development board before really going all-in on the miniaturization process. As of right now he’s planning on using the Allwinner A33 to power the board a sub-$10 USD chipset most commonly seen in low-cost Android tablets. The A33 boasts a quad-core Cortex-A7 clocked at 1.2 GHz and SPI interfaces for expansion. It will be paired with 1 GB of DDR3 RAM and an SD card to hold the operating system. Naturally a device like this will need WiFi but until [Walker] can decide on which chip to use the plan is to just use a USB wireless adapter. The Realtek RTL8188CUS is a strong contender as the fact that it comes in both USB and module versions should make its eventual integration seamless. Even if you’re not interested in the idea of hiding security appliances inside of everyday objects this project is a fascinating glimpse into the process of creating your own custom Linux board . Whether you’re looking to put into a wall wart or a drone it’s pretty incredible to think we’ve reached the point where an individual can spin up their own miniature SBC. Modified Microwave Cures Resin Parts With Style Once you make the leap to resin-based 3D printing you’ll quickly find that putting parts out in the sun to cure isn’t always a viable solution. The best way to get consistent results is with a dedicated curing chamber that not only rotates the parts so they’re evenly exposed to the light but allows you to dial in a specific curing time. A beeper that goes off when the part is done would be handy as well. Wait this is starting to sound kind of familiar… [Stynus] isn’t the first person to notice the similarities between an ideal UV curing machine and the lowly microwave oven. But his conversion is certainly one of the slickest we’ve ever seen like a hacked microwave so much as a purpose-built curing machine thanks in large part to the fact that all of the original controls are still functional. The big break there came when [Stynus] noticed that the control panel was powered by a one-time programmable PIC16C65B microcontroller. Swapping that out for the pin-compatible PIC16F877A opened up the possibility of writing custom firmware to interface with all the microwave’s original hardware he just needed to reverse engineer how it was all wired up. It took some time to figure out how the limited pins on the microcontroller ran the LED display and read the buttons and switches at the same time but we’d say the final result is more than worth the work. With full control over the microwave’s hardware all [Stynus] had to do was strip out all the scary high voltage bits (which were no longer functional to begin with) and install an array of UV LEDs. Now he can just toss a part on the plate spin the dial to the desired curing time and press a button. In the video below you can see he’s even repurposed some of the buttons on the control panel to let him do things like set a new default “cook” time to EEPROM. Compared to the more traditional fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printers resin printing requires a lot of additional post-processing and equipment don’t necessarily have to gut your microwave but you’d be wise to fully consider your workflow will look like before pulling the trigger on that shiny new printer. “Modified Microwave Cures Resin Parts With Style” Soviet Super 8 Camera Hides Raspberry Pi Zero A few years ago [Xabier Zubizarreta] got it into his head that he wanted to put a modern digital image sensor into a classic Super 8 camera but he didn’t want to ruin a gorgeous piece of vintage hardware in the process. After a bit of research he discovered an export version of the Avrora camera made for the 1980 Summer Olympic Games in Moscow that could be had for cheap. Figuring nobody would miss a camera built with the utilitarian aesthetics you’d expect of a Soviet-era piece of consumer tech cram a Raspberry Pi into its film compartment On the Hackaday.io page for this project [Xabier] explains a bit about the optical properties that make this project challenging. Specifically the miniature sensor used by the official Raspberry Pi camera module is far smaller than the 8 mm film the camera was designed for. So when the sensor placed at the appropriate focal length for the original film the image will be cropped considerably. As you can see in the video below this gives the impression of everything being filmed with a fairly tight zoom. [Xabier] first had to liberate the sensor of the Pi Camera from the original optics and then carefully install it in proper position on the Avrora. To make sure he had it aligned he watched a live feed from the camera while the epoxy holding the sensor down was curing. This allowed him to make slight adjustments before everything was solidified. With the sensor in place he only had to stuff the Pi Zero and battery pack into the film compartment and wire the original camera trigger to the GPIO pins so he could read it in software. incredible amount of effort some photographers have put in adapt their vintage cameras to digital it’s refreshing to see such a straightforward approach. The resulting video might not be up to modern standards but with projects like this that’s sort of the point. “Soviet Super 8 Camera Hides Raspberry Pi Zero” The Russian Woodpecker: Official Bird Of The Cold War Nests In Giant Antenna And What It Can Do For You How To Build A Turbo Car The Cheap SpaceX Drops The Ball On Catching Fairings South Australia Vs.

How to import modules in Python? you will learn to create and import custom modules in Python. Also you will find different techniques to import and use custom and built-in modules in Python. Modules refer to a file containing Python statements and definitions. and its module name would be We use modules to break down large programs into small manageable and organized files. Furthermore modules provide reusability of code. We can define our most used functions in a module and import it instead of copying their definitions into different programs. Let us create a module. Type the following and save it as b):
   """"""This program adds two
   numbers and return the result""""""

   result = a + b
   return result . The function takes in two numbers and returns their sum. How to import modules in Python? We can import the definitions inside a module to another module or the interactive interpreter in Python. keyword to do this. To import our previously defined module we type the following in the Python prompt. This does not import the names of the functions defined in directly in the current symbol table. It only imports the module name Using the module name we can access the function using the dot Python has tons of standard modules. You can check out the full list of and their use cases. These files are in the Lib directory inside the location where you installed Python. Standard modules can be imported the same way as we import our user-defined modules. There are various ways to import modules. They are listed below.. We can import a module using the statement and access the definitions inside it using the dot operator as described above. Here is an example. # import statement example
# to import standard module math

import math
print(""The value of pi is"" The value of pi is 3.141592653589793 We can import a module by renaming it as follows: # import module by renaming it

import math as m
print(""The value of pi is"" . This can save us typing time in some cases. is not recognized in our scope. Hence We can import specific names from a module without importing the module as a whole. Here is an example. # import only pi from math module

from math import pi
print(""The value of pi is"" we don't use the dot operator. We can also import multiple attributes as follows: We can import all names(definitions) from a module using the following construct: # import all names from the standard module math

from math import *
print(""The value of pi is"" we have imported all the definitions from the math module. This includes all names visible in our scope except those beginning with an underscore(private definitions). Importing everything with the asterisk (*) symbol is not a good programming practice. This can lead to duplicate definitions for an identifier. It also hampers the readability of our code. Python looks at several places. Interpreter first looks for a built-in module. Then(if built-in module not found) Python looks into a list of directories defined in . The search is in this order. (an environment variable with a list of directories). We can add and modify this list to add our own path. The Python interpreter imports a module only once during a session. This makes things more efficient. Here is an example to show how this works. Suppose we have the following code in a module named # This module shows the effect of
#  multiple imports and reload

print(""This code got executed"") Now we see the effect of multiple imports. >>> import my_module
This code got executed
>>> import my_module
>>> import my_module We can see that our code got executed only once. This goes to say that our module was imported only once. Now if our module changed during the course of the program we would have to reload it.One way to do this is to restart the interpreter. But this does not help much. Python provides a more efficient way of doing this. We can use the module to reload a module. We can do it in the following ways: >>> import imp
>>> import my_module
This code got executed
>>> import my_module
>>> imp.reload(my_module)
This code got executed
<module 'my_module' from '.\\my_module.py'> function to find out names that are defined inside a module. we have defined a function that we had in the beginning. we can see a sorted list of names (along with ). All other names that begin with an underscore are default Python attributes associated with the module (not user-defined). attribute contains the name of the module. All the names defined in our current namespace can be found out using the >>> a = 1
>>> b = ""hello""
>>> import math
>>> dir()

The block diagram below shows the main components of ESP32-PICO-KIT-1 and their interconnections. ESP32-PICO-KIT-1 Block Diagram (click to enlarge) There are three mutually exclusive ways to provide power to the board: The power supply must be provided using one and only one of the options above otherwise the board and/or the power supply source can be damaged. The two tables below provide the of I/O header pins on both sides of the board . The pin numbering and header names are the same as in the schematic given in The following notes give more information about the items in the tables above. This pin is connected to the pin of the USB bridge chip on the board. 32.768 kHz crystal oscillator:

For bonus points he also managed to put it in a package that’s the same basic size and a plug-in replacement for the original. The first task was deciding which 555 circuit to implement. He examined a handful of different implementations — and by examined dissected them and studied the die circuitry under a microscope. In the end he went with Hans Camenzind’s original circuit both as a tribute and because it used the fewest transistors — a point which helped manage the final size which is only a little bit bigger than the IC! have you ever soldered an EIA 01005 resistor? We agree with [mbedded.ninja] who wrote on a post about standard chip resistor sizes the 01005 is a “ridiculously small chip package that can barely be seen by the naked eye.”  It is 16 thou x 8 thou (0.4 mm x 0.2 mm) in size and despite its name and placement in the Imperial series it is not half the size of an 0201. The transistors are your standard 2N3904 / 2N3906 but purchased in a not-so-standard DFN (Dual Flat Pack No Leads). We might think a 1.0 x 0.6 mm component as small but compared to its neighboring resistors in this circuit [Robo] has done this kind of project before discrete recreation of of the classic 741 op-amp back in 2011. If you want to go really big-scale with your own reproduction project from five years ago for further inspiration. Thanks to [Lucas] for the tip. Original Game Boy Powered Up With GBA Motherboard 01005 is close to the size of a grain of table salt. No way I can hand solder those! The smallest I can do is 0603 and I prefer to use 0805 for hand soldering. Some 10-15 years ago it was common to hear this about 0805 SMD parts. “No way I can hand solder those! The smallest I can do is TO-3 package.” but there’s also equipment and surface tension. Due to surface tension with an iron 0603 is realistically as small as many people can do. Most hot air stations blow smaller parts off the board. When a reflow oven is doing the soldering it doesn’t matter the size once the parts are placed. That’s exactly my point. Nobody’s eyesight has become better since 10 years ago but people learn to use the right tools. People who have problem with hot air often just set it too high with hot air I can go down to 0402 easily with the naked eye (I am very short sighted Using an oven for small parts without pick and place is infuriating the higher chance they have of tombstoning… soldering fine things is as much a matter of experience as it is a matter of having good tools (Mainly a quality hot air station Yeah ive done a fair bit of 0402 lately… Both leds and resistors. Also done both with hot air and sometimes iron… though iron is tricky. Awesome work – if Robo could move the pins inward so that the discrete 555 could plug in into an Could this be the perfect place for “could have just used a 555”? Whilst I’m all for doing something for the sake of it there’s something odd about making the smallest version of a large version of small thing made out of large things. Yup. [Robo] is clearly playing the long game. :) Having lookes at RS and Farnell I’m surprised the smallest 555 you can get is as large as 5mmx4mm. Hasn’t anyone done a minuscule BGA version? The LMC555 comes in a 1 I’m wondering where theses are actually used any picture of a modern device with BGA 555? Can mainly be used in areas where one needs something to be small. It is more or less a specialty chip at that point. I appreciate the effort this takes but you have to be a masochist to try to pull it off.  Just thinking about hand soldering it gives me a headache.  He could put together a whole guide on soldering techniques for these microscopic parts.  I see he uses a hand soldering iron and no reflow. Why did he do that?! He could have used a 555! came here just for this. Because this one is easier to repair if it fails! [Could have done this with a 555 -> not] Many say to use a 555 as WDT because the internal micro-controller WDTs are not considered fail-safe as software is blah blah. I have used a 555 solution where power consumption is not a design issue and where cannot be dependent on the controller’s internal timer; but use of specialty ICs as an external reset source is indicated and probably less design effort and more reliable. And ‘low-current’ 555 solutions using external power-steering transistors is not a good fail-safe solution because you are banging input power on and off which can never be considered to be reliably mono-tonic and you are reducing reliability by adding even more components. some of us old folks distinctly remember complaining about trying to pick up 1/8th watt resistors & having to resort to forceps…LOL Please be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

Video: Python Packages: Organize Your Code We don't usually store all of our files on our computer in the same location. We use a well-organized hierarchy of directories for easier access. Similar files are kept in the same directory we may keep all the songs in the "" Python has packages for directories and As our application program grows larger in size with a lot of modules we place similar modules in one package and different modules in different packages. This makes a project (program) easy to manage and conceptually clear. as a directory can contain subdirectories and files a Python package can have sub-packages and modules. A directory must contain a file named in order for Python to consider it as a package. This file can be left empty but we generally place the initialization code for that package in this file. Here is an example. Suppose we are developing a game. One possible organization of packages and modules could be as shown in the figure below. Package Module Structure in Python Programming We can import modules from packages using the dot (.) operator. if we want to import the it can be done as follows: if this module contains a we must use the full name to reference it. we can import the module without the package prefix as follows: We can now call the function simply as follows: Another way of importing just the required function (or class or variable) from a module within a package would be as follows: Now we can directly call this function. this method is not recommended.

For bonus points he also managed to put it in a package that’s the same basic size and a plug-in replacement for the original. The first task was deciding which 555 circuit to implement. He examined a handful of different implementations — and by examined dissected them and studied the die circuitry under a microscope. In the end he went with Hans Camenzind’s original circuit both as a tribute and because it used the fewest transistors — a point which helped manage the final size which is only a little bit bigger than the IC! have you ever soldered an EIA 01005 resistor? We agree with [mbedded.ninja] who wrote on a post about standard chip resistor sizes the 01005 is a “ridiculously small chip package that can barely be seen by the naked eye.”  It is 16 thou x 8 thou (0.4 mm x 0.2 mm) in size and despite its name and placement in the Imperial series it is not half the size of an 0201. The transistors are your standard 2N3904 / 2N3906 but purchased in a not-so-standard DFN (Dual Flat Pack No Leads). We might think a 1.0 x 0.6 mm component as small but compared to its neighboring resistors in this circuit [Robo] has done this kind of project before discrete recreation of of the classic 741 op-amp back in 2011. If you want to go really big-scale with your own reproduction project from five years ago for further inspiration. Thanks to [Lucas] for the tip. Original Game Boy Powered Up With GBA Motherboard 01005 is close to the size of a grain of table salt. No way I can hand solder those! The smallest I can do is 0603 and I prefer to use 0805 for hand soldering. Some 10-15 years ago it was common to hear this about 0805 SMD parts. “No way I can hand solder those! The smallest I can do is TO-3 package.” but there’s also equipment and surface tension. Due to surface tension with an iron 0603 is realistically as small as many people can do. Most hot air stations blow smaller parts off the board. When a reflow oven is doing the soldering it doesn’t matter the size once the parts are placed. That’s exactly my point. Nobody’s eyesight has become better since 10 years ago but people learn to use the right tools. People who have problem with hot air often just set it too high with hot air I can go down to 0402 easily with the naked eye (I am very short sighted Using an oven for small parts without pick and place is infuriating the higher chance they have of tombstoning… soldering fine things is as much a matter of experience as it is a matter of having good tools (Mainly a quality hot air station Yeah ive done a fair bit of 0402 lately… Both leds and resistors. Also done both with hot air and sometimes iron… though iron is tricky. Awesome work – if Robo could move the pins inward so that the discrete 555 could plug in into an Could this be the perfect place for “could have just used a 555”? Whilst I’m all for doing something for the sake of it there’s something odd about making the smallest version of a large version of small thing made out of large things. Yup. [Robo] is clearly playing the long game. :) Having lookes at RS and Farnell I’m surprised the smallest 555 you can get is as large as 5mmx4mm. Hasn’t anyone done a minuscule BGA version? The LMC555 comes in a 1 I’m wondering where theses are actually used any picture of a modern device with BGA 555? Can mainly be used in areas where one needs something to be small. It is more or less a specialty chip at that point. I appreciate the effort this takes but you have to be a masochist to try to pull it off.  Just thinking about hand soldering it gives me a headache.  He could put together a whole guide on soldering techniques for these microscopic parts.  I see he uses a hand soldering iron and no reflow. Why did he do that?! He could have used a 555! came here just for this. Because this one is easier to repair if it fails! [Could have done this with a 555 -> not] Many say to use a 555 as WDT because the internal micro-controller WDTs are not considered fail-safe as software is blah blah. I have used a 555 solution where power consumption is not a design issue and where cannot be dependent on the controller’s internal timer; but use of specialty ICs as an external reset source is indicated and probably less design effort and more reliable. And ‘low-current’ 555 solutions using external power-steering transistors is not a good fail-safe solution because you are banging input power on and off which can never be considered to be reliably mono-tonic and you are reducing reliability by adding even more components. some of us old folks distinctly remember complaining about trying to pick up 1/8th watt resistors & having to resort to forceps…LOL Please be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

When to use Decimal instead of float? you'll learn about the different numbers used in Python how to convert from one data type to the other and the mathematical operations supported in Python. floating-point numbers and complex numbers. They are defined as Integers and floating points are separated by the presence or absence of a decimal point. For instance 5 is an integer whereas 5.0 is a floating-point number. Complex numbers are written in the form function to know which class a variable or a value belongs to and function to check if it belongs to a particular class. a = 5

print(type(a))

print(type(5.0))

c = 5 + 3j
print(c + 3)

print(isinstance(c When we run the above program we get the following output: While integers can be of any length a floating-point number is accurate only up to 15 decimal places (the 16th place is inaccurate). The numbers we deal with every day are of the decimal (base 10) number system. But computer programmers (generally embedded programmers) need to work with binary (base 2) hexadecimal (base 16) and octal (base 8) number systems. we can represent these numbers by appropriately placing a prefix before that number. The following table lists these prefixes. # Output: 107
print(0b1101011)

# Output: 253 (251 + 2)
print(0xFB + 0b10)

# Output: 13
print(0o15) We can convert one type of number into another. This is also known as coercion. subtraction coerce integer to float implicitly (automatically) if one of the operands is float. We can see above that 1 (integer) is coerced into 1.0 (float) for addition and the result is also a floating point number. We can also use built-in functions like to convert between types explicitly. These functions can even convert from When converting from float to integer the number gets truncated (decimal parts are removed). Python built-in class float performs some calculations that might amaze us. We all know that the sum of 1.1 and 2.2 is 3.3 but Python seems to disagree. >>> (1.1 + 2.2) == 3.3
False It turns out that floating-point numbers are implemented in computer hardware as binary fractions as the computer only understands binary (0 and 1). Due to this reason most of the decimal fractions we know cannot be accurately stored in our computer. Let's take an example. We cannot represent the fraction 1/3 as a decimal number. This will give 0.33333333... which is infinitely long and we can only approximate it. It turns out that the decimal fraction 0.1 will result in an infinitely long binary fraction of 0.000110011001100110011... and our computer only stores a finite number of it. This will only approximate 0.1 but never be equal. Hence it is the limitation of our computer hardware and not an error in Python. we can use the decimal module that comes with Python. While floating-point numbers have precision up to 15 decimal places the decimal module has user-settable precision. This module is used when we want to carry out decimal calculations as we learned in school. It also preserves significance. We know 25.50 kg is more accurate than 25.5 kg as it has two significant decimal places compared to one. from decimal import Decimal as D

print(D('1.1') + D('2.2'))

print(D('1.2') * D('2.50')) Notice the trailing zeroes in the above example. instead of float? The main reason is efficiency. Floating point operations are carried out must faster than When to use Decimal instead of float? We generally use Decimal in the following cases. When we are making financial applications that need exact decimal representation. When we want to control the level of precision required. When we want to implement the notion of significant decimal places. Python provides operations involving fractional numbers through its A fraction has a numerator and a denominator both of which are integers. This module has support for rational number arithmetic. We can create Fraction objects in various ways. Let's have a look at them. we might get some unusual results. This is due to the imperfect binary floating point number representation as discussed in the previous section. allows us to instantiate with string as well. This is the preferred option when using decimal numbers. import fractions

For bonus points he also managed to put it in a package that’s the same basic size and a plug-in replacement for the original. The first task was deciding which 555 circuit to implement. He examined a handful of different implementations — and by examined dissected them and studied the die circuitry under a microscope. In the end he went with Hans Camenzind’s original circuit both as a tribute and because it used the fewest transistors — a point which helped manage the final size which is only a little bit bigger than the IC! have you ever soldered an EIA 01005 resistor? We agree with [mbedded.ninja] who wrote on a post about standard chip resistor sizes the 01005 is a “ridiculously small chip package that can barely be seen by the naked eye.”  It is 16 thou x 8 thou (0.4 mm x 0.2 mm) in size and despite its name and placement in the Imperial series it is not half the size of an 0201. The transistors are your standard 2N3904 / 2N3906 but purchased in a not-so-standard DFN (Dual Flat Pack No Leads). We might think a 1.0 x 0.6 mm component as small but compared to its neighboring resistors in this circuit [Robo] has done this kind of project before discrete recreation of of the classic 741 op-amp back in 2011.

Artwork Spans Fifty Years Of Display Technology Swiss artist and designer [Jürg Lehni] was commissioned to create an artwork called which has been installed in the in Basel. This piece visually depicts the changes in technologies used by public information displays such as those in airports and train stations. As the title of the installation suggests four different technologies are represented: 15 each 7 x 7 modules arrayed into a 21 x 35 pixel panel two each 36 x 52 modules arrayed into 52 x 76 pixel panel six each 16 x 16 RGB modules arrayed into a 32 x 48 pixel panel 1200 x 1920 pixel panel The final work is quite striking but equally interesting is the summary of the the design and construction process that [Jürg] provides on Twitter. We hope he expands this into a future more detailed writeup — if only to learn about reverse engineering the 20 year old LCD controller whose designer was in retirement. His tweets also gives us a tantalizing glimpse into the software and interconnections used to drive all these displays. There is quite a lot of interesting engineering going on in the background and we look forward to future documentation from [Jürg]. You may recognize [Jürg] as the creator of from 2002 which we’ve referenced over the years in Hackaday. Check out the short video below of the displays in operation and be sure to unmute the volume so you can listen to the satisfying sound of 735 flip-dots changing state. [Jürg] also gives in interview about the project in the second video below. Thanks to [Niklas Roy] for sending in the tip about this most interesting exhibition. “Artwork Spans Fifty Years Of Display Technology” [Akaki Kuumeri] had an old Wacom Intuos digitizing graphics tablet collecting dust figured out how to non-destructively transform it into a drawing tablet. He was inspired by an but it required literally hacking a big hole into your Wacom tablet . Not wanting to permanently ruin the Wacom tablet [Akaki] instead designed a 3D printed frame which he holds in place with a pair of straps. The design files are incorrectly as he later points out he buys an old third-generation iPad and removes its Retina display panel and the foil backing which would otherwise block the stylus’s connection to the tablet. Toss in an HDMI driver board to connect the display to your computer and presto — you have made your own a drawing tablet. Even if you don’t need a drawing tablet [Akaki]’s hack is still interesting if only to remind us that we can put custom HDMI displays into any project for $65 using this technique. [Akaki] notes that unless you already have a non-graphical digitizing tablet laying around it’s probably cheaper to just buy a iPad. This is not [Akaki]’s first go at user input devices — we wrote about his Do any of you use a graphics tablet in your day to day workflow? Let us know in the comments below. With some free time on his hands waiting for delayed parts to arrive reverse engineer an old VME system computers are based on the standard which defines a wide range of card sizes — the most common being 6U height like [Rik]’s system. They usually consist of a rack-mounted card cage with a passive backplane. Originally Motorola 68000-based CPU cards were used in VMEbus systems but any processor could be used as long as you provided the right signals and timings to the system bus. Eurocard systems are less common these days but are still used in some applications. In fact you may be using Eurocards today — the is based on the standard 3U card size. he had no idea what this system was nor how to use it. A bit of probing around and he found two UARTs and a way to load and dump S-record files. He documents the process quite well as the internal layout and memory map of the system is unlocked piece by piece. We also like his method of instrumenting the VMEbus signals — logic analyzers are so small today you can just mount one inside the rack. Spoiler alert: [Rik] succeeds in mapping out the memory writes some small programs in 68k assembly language and even builds his own LED accessory card so he can blink some lights (as one must do). and VMEbus + Eurocard systems are good examples of modular design. You could quickly put together a robust assembly using entirely off-the-shelf cards or mix in your own custom cards. But technology advancements in clock speeds and miniaturization have made these card cage passive backplane systems less and less relevant today. Do any of you still use the VMEbus or have you designed with them in the past? Let us know down in the comments below. Synth Gains Plug And Play Analog MUX High school computer engineering teacher [Andy Birch] kept losing track of I/O pins on his home-built synth so he made a custom plug and play addressable MUX system to solve the problem. [Andy]’s synth is based on the Teensy microcontroller and he was already using CMOS analog 8:1 multiplexer chips (CD4051) to give him more I/O pins. But I/O pin expansion means that now there are more I/O pins to forget. Did I hook up that pitch potentiometer on U3 pin 13 or was it U10 pin 2? He proceeds to design an addressing system for each I/O card using three bits (expandable to four) supporting eight cards with a maximum of 16 possible in the future. Since each card may not use all eight signals each card can tell the Teensy how many signals it has. [Andy] does his address decoding on each card using OR and XOR gates. We would have considered using a single 74HC85 four-bit magnitude comparator instead. That would require only one chip instead of two but would deprive his students of the opportunity to learn gate level address decoding. When seeing the term “I/O card” you may be fooled like we were into thinking this was using PCBs and some kind of motherboard. [Andy]’s I/O cards are actually solderless breadboards mounted on the back of the synth control panel. We really like his bus technique — he removes the power strip sections from several breadboards and repurposes them as address and data buses. Check out the thorough documentation that [Andy] has prepared and let us know if you have ever designed your own plug and play method for a project in the comments below. I/O Cards — Note the use of Power Strip Bars as Data / Address Buses Teaching A USBasp Programmer To Speak TPI Last Fall [Kevin] wanted to program some newer TPI-only AVRs using an old USBasp he had kicking around his lab. Finding an “odd famine of information” and “forums filled with incorrect information and schematics” he decided to set the record straight and . He sleuthed out the details and succeeded in reprogramming the USBasp although he did end up buying a second one in the process. Designers who use AVR microcontrollers have no shortage of programming interfaces — we count at least five different methods: ISP/SPI and UPDI. We’re not sure whether this is variety is good or bad but it is what it is. [Kevin] discovers that for the particular family of Attiny devices he is using TPI is the only option available. While he normally builds his designs around ARM Cortex-M chips [Kevin] needed some glue logic and decided to go with an ATtiny20 despite its unique programming requirements. He observes that the price of the ATtiny20 was cheaper than the equivalent logic gates he needed. This particular chip is also quite small — only 3 mm square (a 20-pin VQFN). We would prefer not to use different MCUs and tool chains on a single board but sometimes the convenience and economics steer the design in that direction. If you’re not familiar with the USBasp our own [Mike Szczys] covered the breaking story over ten years ago . And if you have a lot of free time on your hands ditch all these nicely packaged solutions and program your chips using an old USB Hub and a 74HCT00 NAND gate as I2C Paper Tape Reader Is Not What You Think We’re not quite sure what drove the development of this project but [shapoco] has put together an intriguing device that reads I2C signals (Japanese Twitter link) which have been printed as black and white rectangles on paper tape. He wrote a program that prints an I2C byte stream onto strips containing the SCL and SDA signal patterns. Once printed you cut the strips from the paper and glue them together into one long piece making a complete message — in this case commands to a small LCD screen that will display the phrase “Hello We’re not sure exactly sure what’s inside that rectangular widget epoxied to the bottom of that perf board through which the tape passes. But clearly it must contain a pair of LEDs to illuminate the tape and a pair of sensors to detect the reflection off the tape (looking at the wiring it seems unlikely that anything is mounted underneath the tape). According to one machine-translated Twitter message detection is done using a Schmitt trigger made from an LM393 comparator with hysteresis (see for a review of this type of circuit). Here’s a scope capture of the resulting signals. [Shapoco] notes that the circuit can operate much faster — the tape is being pulled slowly in the video to make it easier to see. This is not [shapoco]’s first experiment in optical I2C communications. Check out the second video down below where he’s reading I2C signals from a computer’s display. One person tweeted about how software source code was sometimes printed optically in old Byte magazines many years ago a topic we talked about in last year when discussing Cauzin strips. and possibly helpful as an educational device does this technique have any real-world applications these days?

More specifically when to use them and various methods you should be familiar with. A tuple in Python is similar to a . The difference between the two is that we cannot change the elements of a tuple once it is assigned whereas we can change the elements of a list. A tuple is created by placing all the items (elements) inside parentheses separated by commas. The parentheses are optional it is a good practice to use them. A tuple can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer # Different types of tuples

# Empty tuple
my_tuple = ()
print(my_tuple)

# Tuple having integers
my_tuple = (1 3)
print(my_tuple)

# tuple with mixed datatypes
my_tuple = (1 3.4)
print(my_tuple)

# nested tuple
my_tuple = (""mouse"" A tuple can also be created without using parentheses. This is known as tuple packing. ""dog""
print(my_tuple)

# tuple unpacking is also possible
a c = my_tuple

print(a)      # 3
print(b)      # 4.6
print(c)      # dog Creating a tuple with one element is a bit tricky. Having one element within parentheses is not enough. We will need a trailing comma to indicate that it is my_tuple = (""hello"")
print(type(my_tuple))  # <class 'str'>

# Creating a tuple having one element
my_tuple = (""hello"" )
print(type(my_tuple))  # <class 'tuple'>

# Parentheses is optional
my_tuple = ""hello"" There are various ways in which we can access the elements of a tuple. We can use the index operator to access an item in a tuple where the index starts from 0. a tuple having 6 elements will have indices from 0 to 5. Trying to access an index outside of the tuple index range(6 ... in this example) will raise an The index must be an integer so we cannot use float or other types. This will result in nested tuples are accessed using nested indexing as shown in the example below. # Accessing tuple elements using indexing
my_tuple = ('p' 't')

print(my_tuple[0])   # 'p' 
print(my_tuple[5])   # 't'

# IndexError: list index out of range
# print(my_tuple[6])

# Index must be an integer
# TypeError: list indices must be integers not float
# my_tuple[2.0]

# nested tuple
n_tuple = (""mouse"" 3))

# nested index
print(n_tuple[0][3])       # 's'
print(n_tuple[1][1])       # 4 Python allows negative indexing for its sequences. The index of -1 refers to the last item -2 to the second last item and so on. # Negative indexing for accessing tuple elements
my_tuple = ('p' 't')

# Output: 't'
print(my_tuple[-1])

# Output: 'p'
print(my_tuple[-6]) We can access a range of items in a tuple by using the slicing operator colon # Accessing tuple elements using slicing
my_tuple = ('p' 'z')

# elements 2nd to 4th
# Output: ('r' 'g')
print(my_tuple[1:4])

# elements beginning to 2nd
# Output: ('p' 'r')
print(my_tuple[:-7])

# elements 8th to end
# Output: ('i' 'z')
print(my_tuple[7:])

# elements beginning to end
# Output: ('p' Slicing can be best visualized by considering the index to be between the elements as shown below. So if we want to access a range we need the index that will slice the portion from the tuple. This means that elements of a tuple cannot be changed once they have been assigned. But if the element is itself a mutable data type like a list its nested items can be changed. We can also assign a tuple to different values (reassignment). # Changing tuple values
my_tuple = (4 5])


# TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
# my_tuple[1] = 9

# However item of mutable element can be changed
my_tuple[3][0] = 9    # Output: (4 5])
print(my_tuple)

# Tuples can be reassigned
my_tuple = ('p' operator to combine two tuples. This is called the elements in a tuple for a given number of times using the operations result in a new tuple. we cannot change the elements in a tuple. It means that we cannot delete or remove items from a tuple. is possible using the keyword 'z')

# can't delete items
# TypeError: 'tuple' object doesn't support item deletion
# del my_tuple[3]

# Can delete an entire tuple
del my_tuple

# NameError: name 'my_tuple' is not defined
print(my_tuple) Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<string>"" in <module>
NameError: name 'my_tuple' is not defined Methods that add items or remove items are not available with tuple. Only the following two methods are available. Some examples of Python tuple methods: )

print(my_tuple.count('p'))  # Output: 2
print(my_tuple.index('l'))  # Output: 3 We can test if an item exists in a tuple or not # Membership test in tuple
my_tuple = ('a' )

# In operation
print('a' in my_tuple)
print('b' in my_tuple)

# Not in operation
print('g' not in my_tuple) loop to iterate through each item in a tuple. # Using a for loop to iterate through a tuple
for name in ('John' 'Kate'):
    print(""Hello"" Since tuples are quite similar to lists both of them are used in similar situations. However there are certain advantages of implementing a tuple over a list. Below listed are some of the main advantages: We generally use tuples for heterogeneous (different) data types and lists for homogeneous (similar) data types. iterating through a tuple is faster than with list. So there is a slight performance boost. Tuples that contain immutable elements can be used as a key for a dictionary. With lists If you have data that doesn't change implementing it as tuple will guarantee that it remains write-protected. Join our newsletter for the latest updates.

1620762875.470479,3501605,https://hackaday.com/2021/05/10/sinclair-basic-for-today/,If you are of a certain age your first exposure to computer programming was probably BASIC. For a few years there were few cheaper ways to program in BASIC than the Sinclair ZX series of computers. If you long for those days you might find the 1980-something variant of BASIC a little limiting. Or you could use SpecBasic is apparently reasonably compatible with the Spectrum but lets you use your better hardware. For example instead of a 256×192 8-color screen SpecBas accommodates larger screens and up to 256 colors. However that does lead to certain incompatibilities that you can read about in the project’s README file. The README also has instructions for configuring the system to use larger fonts which may help readability on large monitors. There’s also a file full of demos you’ll probably want to look at. While learning 1980-era BASIC today isn’t much of a career move we do think that learning simple programming concepts in a simple uncluttered environment that is very interactive isn’t a bad thing. After all it worked for an entire generation of developers. If you prefer your BASIC coding on the Web maybe you just want something The Laser Power Record Has Been Broken But if you’re of a different certain age you started with machine language because your computer didn’t have BASIC in ROM and the 1K of RAM couldn’t fit an interpreter. so you had to hand assemble the code. … and if you’re of a certain age there was no such thing as machine language the “program” was encoded in the wires that ran from socket-to-socket in the patch panel. And if you are of a certain age you WERE the computer & the best you had was a book of log tables & possibly a mechanical adding machine And if you were of a certain age before that you would have to go around your neighbourhood collecting femurs for your homebrew Napier’s bones which is where the term Hacker originates. And if you were of a certain age before that you were a single celled prokaryote floating around in the primordial ooze with no concept of I started in ZX Spectrum basic it’s nice to have something out of a box. After mandatory snake whatever in basic … it’s gets reduced to a single line that starts machine code anyways. There were also hex loaders written in basic with which you would type in load and execute your previously manually on-paper assembled and linked machine code. Feinfinger (super villain in nostalgy mode) At least that was what my SC/MP had attached in a certain past… The KIM-1 had only four readouts the built in monitor made things so easy. I’m actually of that age ;) 1K? I had 256 bytes on my Elf until I wirewrapped an 8K board. Then you could run Tom Pittman’s Tiny BASIC or CHIP-8. Although the ZX81 did manage to run a BASIC interpreter in 1K of RAM. The BASIC was in a 4K ROM if I recall. I built mine from a kit as it was $99 when they first came out. No long after Timex/Sinclair’s were sold at department stores. You got 1K of memory for your program unless you splurged for the Memotek 32K memory. I opted for their as opposed to the Sinclair 16l because it preserved the I/O connector. Within a year I had a C64 so I have all the memory I’d ever need. Or so I thought at the time. The clever thing about Sinclair BASIC was that it offloaded the tokenisation onto the user. So finding which of the 5 actions per key and what combination of shifts might get you that ‘word’ was the game. Then the legends started rubbing off the ‘keyboard’… … and if you’re of a certain age your (mini) computer was the length of your garage! Really – mine was in 1977 :) there were those patch panel programmed ones. Fortunately I just missed them. But I did witness entering bootstrap machine code using an ASR33 so the Univac would read a program from punched cards. Feinfinger (super villain in nostalgy mode) I really do not miss the ASR’s decibels… but it is from the 90’s this feels more like one of those Fantasy Consoles nowadays. Cool! Mac and Windows.

How to create a string in Python? How to access characters in a string? How to change or delete a string? Concatenation of Two or More Strings Built-in functions to Work with Python Raw String to ignore escape sequence The format() Method for Formatting Strings In this tutorial you will learn to create modify and delete strings in Python. Also you will be introduced to various string operations and functions. A string is a sequence of characters. A character is simply a symbol. For example the English language has 26 characters. Computers do not deal with characters they deal with numbers (binary). Even though you may see characters on your screen internally it is stored and manipulated as a combination of 0s and 1s. This conversion of character to a number is called encoding and the reverse process is decoding. ASCII and Unicode are some of the popular encodings used. a string is a sequence of Unicode characters. Unicode was introduced to include every character in all languages and bring uniformity in encoding. You can learn about Unicode from How to create a string in Python? Strings can be created by enclosing characters inside a single quote or double-quotes. Even triple quotes can be used in Python but generally used to represent multiline strings and docstrings. # defining strings in Python
# all of the following are equivalent
my_string = 'Hello'
print(my_string)

my_string = ""Hello""
print(my_string)

my_string = '''Hello'''
print(my_string)

# triple quotes string can extend multiple lines
my_string = """"""Hello welcome to
           the world of Python""""""
print(my_string) welcome to
           the world of Python How to access characters in a string? We can access individual characters using indexing and a range of characters using slicing. Index starts from 0. Trying to access a character out of index range will raise an . The index must be an integer. We can't use floats or other types Python allows negative indexing for its sequences. to the second last item and so on. We can access a range of items in a string by using the slicing operator #Accessing string characters in Python
str = 'programiz'
print('str = ' str[-1])

#slicing 2nd to 5th character
print('str[1:5] = ' str[1:5])

#slicing 6th to 2nd last character
print('str[5:-2] = ' When we run the above program we get the following output: str =  programiz
str[0] =  p
str[-1] =  z
str[1:5] =  rogr
str[5:-2] =  am If we try to access an index out of the range or use numbers other than an integer # index must be in range
>>> my_string[15]  
...
IndexError: string index out of range

# index must be an integer
>>> my_string[1.5] 
...
TypeError: string indices must be integers Slicing can be best visualized by considering the index to be between the elements as shown below. If we want to access a range we need the index that will slice the portion from the string. How to change or delete a string? Strings are immutable. This means that elements of a string cannot be changed once they have been assigned. We can simply reassign different strings to the same name. >>> my_string = 'programiz'
>>> my_string[5] = 'a'
...
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
>>> my_string = 'Python'
>>> my_string
'Python' We cannot delete or remove characters from a string. But deleting the string entirely is possible using the >>> del my_string[1]
...
TypeError: 'str' object doesn't support item deletion
>>> del my_string
>>> my_string
...
NameError: name 'my_string' is not defined There are many operations that can be performed with strings which makes it one of the most used data types in Python. To learn more about the data types available in Python visit: Concatenation of Two or More Strings Joining of two or more strings into a single one is called concatenation. operator does this in Python. Simply writing two string literals together also concatenates them. operator can be used to repeat the string for a given number of times. # Python String Operations
str1 = 'Hello'
str2 ='World!'

# using +
print('str1 + str2 = ' str1 + str2)

# using *
print('str1 * 3 =' When we run the above program we get the following output: str1 + str2 =  HelloWorld!
str1 * 3 = HelloHelloHello Writing two string literals together also concatenates them like If we want to concatenate strings in different lines >>> # two string literals together
>>> 'Hello ''World!'
'Hello World!'

>>> # using parentheses
>>> s = ('Hello '
...      'World')
>>> s
'Hello World' We can iterate through a string using a . Here is an example to count the number of 'l's in a string. # Iterating through a string
count = 0
for letter in 'Hello World':
    if(letter == 'l'):
        count += 1
print(count When we run the above program we get the following output: We can test if a substring exists within a string or not >>> 'a' in 'program'
True
>>> 'at' not in 'battle'
False Built-in functions to Work with Python Various built-in functions that work with sequence work with strings as well. Some of the commonly used ones are function returns an enumerate object. It contains the index and value of all the items in the string as pairs. This can be useful for iteration. returns the length (number of characters) of the string. str = 'cold'

# enumerate()
list_enumerate = list(enumerate(str))
print('list(enumerate(str) = ' When we run the above program we get the following output: If we want to print a text like we can neither use single quotes nor double quotes. This will result in a as the text itself contains both single and double quotes. ""What's there?"""")
...
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>> print('He said One way to get around this problem is to use triple quotes. Alternatively we can use escape sequences. An escape sequence starts with a backslash and is interpreted differently. If we use a single quote to represent a string all the single quotes inside the string must be escaped. Similar is the case with double quotes. Here is how it can be done to represent the above text. ""What's there?""''')

# escaping single quotes
print('He said ""What\'s there?""')

# escaping double quotes
print(""He said When we run the above program we get the following output: Here is a list of all the escape sequences supported by Python. >>> print(""C:\\Python32\\Lib"")
C:\Python32\Lib

>>> print(""This is printed\nin two lines"")
This is printed
in two lines

>>> print(""This is \x48\x45\x58 representation"")
This is HEX representation Raw String to ignore escape sequence Sometimes we may wish to ignore the escape sequences inside a string. To do this we can place in front of the string. This will imply that it is a raw string and any escape sequence inside it will be ignored. >>> print(""This is \x61 \ngood example"")
This is a
good example
>>> print(r""This is \x61 \ngood example"")
This is \x61 \ngood example The format() Method for Formatting Strings method that is available with the string object is very versatile and powerful in formatting strings. Format strings contain curly braces as placeholders or replacement fields which get replaced. We can use positional arguments or keyword arguments to specify the order. # Python string format() method

# default(implicit) order
default_order = ""{} 'Sean')
print('\n--- Default Order ---')
print(default_order)

# order using positional argument
positional_order = ""{1} 'Sean')
print('\n--- Positional Order ---')
print(positional_order)

# order using keyword argument
keyword_order = ""{s} When we run the above program we get the following output: Bill and Sean

--- Positional Order ---
Bill John and Sean

--- Keyword Order ---
Sean method can have optional format specifications. They are separated from the field name using colon. For example a string in the given space. We can also format integers as binary etc. and floats can be rounded or displayed in the exponent format. There are tons of formatting you can use. Visit here for all the >>> # formatting integers
>>> ""Binary representation of {0} is {0:b}"".format(12)
'Binary representation of 12 is 1100'

>>> # formatting floats
>>> ""Exponent representation: {0:e}"".format(1566.345)
'Exponent representation: 1.566345e+03'

>>> # round off
>>> ""One third is: {0:.3f}"".format(1/3)
'One third is: 0.333'

>>> # string alignment
>>> ""|{:<10}|{:^10}|{:>10}|"".format('butter' 'ham')
'|butter    |  bread   |       ham|' We can even format strings like the old style used in C programming language. We use the >>> x = 12.3456789
>>> print('The value of x is %3.2f' %x)
The value of x is 12.35
>>> print('The value of x is %3.4f' %x)
The value of x is 12.3457 There are numerous methods available with the string object. The method that we mentioned above is one of them. Some of the commonly used methods are etc. Here is a complete list of all the built-in methods to work with strings in Python >>> ""PrOgRaMiZ"".lower()
'programiz'
>>> ""PrOgRaMiZ"".upper()
'PROGRAMIZ'
>>> ""This will split all words into a list"".split()
['This' 'string'])
'This will join all words into a string'
>>> 'Happy New Year'.find('ew')

In my view every tech choice the company had made was wrong. The CEO believed in “empowering the engineer.” They then let their first engineer choose the framework (Scala/Play) because it was what the engineer wanted to use not because it made sense for the company or the recruiting pool. Much of the early technical work had been outsourced. Their product roadmap was widely optimistic (web and mobile concurrently) despite the fact that most of the business was still unvalidated. It was a recipe for disaster. Startup engineering is different from any other type of software engineering. It demands short- and medium-term productivity relative to the “right way” of building systems. It values people who are able to iterate quickly and are comfortable with hacky code. It rewards pragmatism in technology choices versus picking the most hyped — or most stable — technology. If your startup has yet to find product-market fit here are four common engineering traps to avoid. The most common startup engineering mistake is to scale prematurely. Premature scaling means building for large scale when you’re still small. Premature scaling trades immediate productivity for far off Premature scaling troubles are everywhere in startups. In the early 2010s relational databases were shunned partly for the (perceived) was lost in the excitement around microservices. For years because it is slower than other frameworks. Premature scaling wastes engineering resources. Scaling before reaching product-market fit is devastating for early startups who have little money and few engineers but huge feature requirements and the constant need to iterate. Why does premature scaling occur so often if it is the number one startup killer? scaling is fun. The initial version of Twitter was a simple monolithic CRUD application that any bootcamp engineer can now build. Just a few years in Twitter had a panoply of interesting problems: large amounts of data to query a huge cost to downtime a huge userbase. Adding in the scaled technologies to address these needs made the job more exciting and more attractive to those joining. The excitement makes early scaling an easy trap for engineering teams to fall into. building performant systems seems rational. Some engineers are appalled by “hacky” systems as if they are a moral failing. This aversion to potentially inelegant solutions is especially an issue for startup engineers who worked for large tech companies where everything must be done at scale. “Do things that don’t scale” is a and it applies in engineering as much as it does in business processes. Technical debt kills less early stage startups than you think. If you’re successful you’ll often have the money to fix all the engineering mistakes you’ve made and shortcuts you’ve taken. engineering roadmaps and tools are built around hyper-optimistic views of the future. Startup leaders are idealistic about how their business grows because they wouldn’t have started the company otherwise. Even once you hit product-market fit — a critical milestone when engineering decisions need to be reassessed — the danger is that you overestimate the level of scale you’ll need. Trying to anticipate future needs before they arise takes valuable resources away from your immediate goal — Startups hurt themselves when they rely too much on is technology that software engineers clamor for. Shiny technology often makes an engineer’s life easier and more enjoyable especially in the extreme short term. But relying on the newest tech misses what will be most productive for the MongoDB’s Javascript-like DSL and JSON data store made writing code an for Javascript developers compared to using relational SQL databases. But ease of use should not be the primary metric when choosing a database. a software engineer told me that he’d never work at a company that didn’t use CoffeeScript (today the debate might be about ). His refusal to even consider other tools promised problems if the right solution was at odds with his preference. has its own issues. The failure states of new tools are poorly understood so it’s hard to anticipate how things will break. New languages/frameworks don’t have libraries or many engineers who can write in them. This lack of resources increases the development effort and makes recruiting challenging. It also means committing your startup’s scarce engineering resources to learning something new when you could be focusing on creating features that your users value. Part of the problem is that engineers — especially non-founders — want to implement technology that makes them seem relevant in the market. That should worry a startup. In spaces like front-end engineering having engineers chase the current hype cycle might mean rewriting the stack every 6–12 months Developers early in their career are especially susceptible to using new and shiny technology instead of tools that make the most sense for the project at hand. They haven’t been through a few hype cycles or seen the downsides of choosing the latest technology. They can miss all the when reading Hacker News or attending hackathons/conferences. these developers don’t realize that just because a technology is hyped that doesn’t make it appropriate in a startup environment. It’s common to take a tech stack of a well known startup or large company and transplant its stack without assessing the appropriateness of these choices. When teams are small developers don’t always have the mentorship from seasoned engineers to counteract the external media they see. Startup developers cite Paul Graham’s famous post where Python increased startup productivity compared to Java. Graham’s post is often used to justify implementing every latest framework and Graham’s real point was that software engineers should pick tools that maximize startup productivity rather than reflexively favor the newest technology. In fact after seeing cohorts of startups at Y Combinator in 2013 Graham was asked about ideal languages. He we have had startups writing their code in PHP — and that worries me a little bit. But not as much as other things worry me.” As an engineer you’re taking a huge risk joining a startup. You shouldn’t add the risk of hyped but unnecessary technology to the mix. Many startup engineering problems stem from hiring the wrong engineers. Startups often look for “rock stars” or “ninjas.” They want gaudy educational credentials and the pixie dust that comes from being part of successful companies. In Silicon Valley startup job posts filter for candidates who use new and shiny technology rather than favoring pragmatic engineers who can learn necessary tools quickly. Once a company starts with perceived “ninjas” and “rock stars ” it sets the tone for every subsequent hire. Startup engineering is rarely taught. The vast number of software engineers work for non-startups. As such most engineers who join startups aren’t trained in startup engineering and don’t have the skillset or attitude to succeed in the startup environment. Consequently startups often must rely on engineers who aren’t a perfect fit for the project. Each of these engineers has their own risk for a startup: are often exposed to scaled systems and may not feel comfortable with hacky code. They are much less likely to be exposed to their users. get bored by the plumbing-type engineering that typifies early startup tasks who are often attracted to startups may inject too much new technology and poorly architect their systems. often favor technologies that let them be productive across many clients. These shops have no incentive to learn new tools for a particular client and they also don’t have the long-term skin in the game needed to make critical early tech decisions. ideal early startup engineers are excited about the company’s mission. This ensures they’ll stay when the company inevitably hits challenges along the journey to product-market fit. They have a minimum viable product mindset and a comfort with constant iteration. The best startup engineers often have a few years of experience in the workforce or on open source projects so that they’ve learned how to maintain systems Rather than seeing particular technologies as silver bullets they favor productive tools that meet the medium term needs of the organization. Great early startup engineers see technology as a means to solving a problem. They think about the problem space (the user’s needs) and how software can be used to solve the problem rather than looking for a problem that a new technology can solve. They need to have a can-do attitude. They rise to the herculean challenges in front of them while moderating the optimism of the product owners. These engineers need empathy and intuition for their users because they often play role of product when iterating. One cautionary note. Even among startup engineers the experience gained at each stage of the startup is radically different. A startup engineer who is effective at five engineers may be terrible at 25. For startups hiring talent seeing an engineer who was part of a successful startup often overwhelms the nuance of what that person actually did there. Startups should look beyond the name brands and hire based on fit for the current project. So many startup mistakes stem from product and management Startup founders are wildly optimistic. The product roadmap then usually exceeds the capabilities of their small teams. This optimism leads to too much hiring this cycle begins to look like “the engineers aren’t performing ” when it actually means that management didn’t set a clear and narrow vision. startup mentality of founders also gives a mistaken sense of certainty to the engineering team about how the system should be built despite the uncertainty that exists in the business model. A better mindset is to support optimistic engineers and develop (internally) pessimistic business leaders with both sides working together to find product-market fit. Another problem for new startups is that management often finds engineering advisors — engineers at other successful startups — to guide the new company. Importing supposed “experts” from potentially unrelated companies or fields raises problems when these advisors transplant what worked at their particular company to a new startup that they have spent only a few hours trying to understand. management needs to recognize that its engineers are a critical component of any major product decision. Too often a company’s engineers are seen as a service organization that can be steamrolled when important business decisions arise (ensuring a healthy product-engineering relationship is one more reason it’s critical to have hired the right engineers). Don’t Shoot Your Startup in the Foot Even if you avoid these startup engineering pitfalls you’ll still be faced with challenges aplenty. But by steering clear of these traps you’ll worry less about self-inflicted wounds. sign up for my mailing list Thanks to Eddie Kim (Cofounder and CTO Andrew Miklas (cofounder and CTO Dr. Michael Lapinski (founder and CTO and others for spirited debates.

1620762919.9728339,59693781,https://hackaday.com/2021/05/10/sinclair-basic-for-today//#comments,If you are of a certain age your first exposure to computer programming was probably BASIC. For a few years there were few cheaper ways to program in BASIC than the Sinclair ZX series of computers. If you long for those days you might find the 1980-something variant of BASIC a little limiting. Or you could use SpecBasic is apparently reasonably compatible with the Spectrum but lets you use your better hardware. For example instead of a 256×192 8-color screen SpecBas accommodates larger screens and up to 256 colors. However that does lead to certain incompatibilities that you can read about in the project’s README file. The README also has instructions for configuring the system to use larger fonts which may help readability on large monitors. There’s also a file full of demos you’ll probably want to look at. While learning 1980-era BASIC today isn’t much of a career move we do think that learning simple programming concepts in a simple uncluttered environment that is very interactive isn’t a bad thing. After all it worked for an entire generation of developers. If you prefer your BASIC coding on the Web maybe you just want something The Laser Power Record Has Been Broken But if you’re of a different certain age you started with machine language because your computer didn’t have BASIC in ROM and the 1K of RAM couldn’t fit an interpreter. so you had to hand assemble the code. … and if you’re of a certain age there was no such thing as machine language the “program” was encoded in the wires that ran from socket-to-socket in the patch panel. And if you are of a certain age you WERE the computer & the best you had was a book of log tables & possibly a mechanical adding machine And if you were of a certain age before that you would have to go around your neighbourhood collecting femurs for your homebrew Napier’s bones which is where the term Hacker originates. And if you were of a certain age before that you were a single celled prokaryote floating around in the primordial ooze with no concept of I started in ZX Spectrum basic it’s nice to have something out of a box. After mandatory snake whatever in basic … it’s gets reduced to a single line that starts machine code anyways. There were also hex loaders written in basic with which you would type in load and execute your previously manually on-paper assembled and linked machine code. Feinfinger (super villain in nostalgy mode) At least that was what my SC/MP had attached in a certain past… The KIM-1 had only four readouts the built in monitor made things so easy. I’m actually of that age ;) 1K? I had 256 bytes on my Elf until I wirewrapped an 8K board. Then you could run Tom Pittman’s Tiny BASIC or CHIP-8. Although the ZX81 did manage to run a BASIC interpreter in 1K of RAM. The BASIC was in a 4K ROM if I recall. I built mine from a kit as it was $99 when they first came out. No long after Timex/Sinclair’s were sold at department stores. You got 1K of memory for your program unless you splurged for the Memotek 32K memory. I opted for their as opposed to the Sinclair 16l because it preserved the I/O connector. Within a year I had a C64 so I have all the memory I’d ever need. Or so I thought at the time. The clever thing about Sinclair BASIC was that it offloaded the tokenisation onto the user. So finding which of the 5 actions per key and what combination of shifts might get you that ‘word’ was the game. Then the legends started rubbing off the ‘keyboard’… … and if you’re of a certain age your (mini) computer was the length of your garage! Really – mine was in 1977 :) there were those patch panel programmed ones. Fortunately I just missed them. But I did witness entering bootstrap machine code using an ASR33 so the Univac would read a program from punched cards. Feinfinger (super villain in nostalgy mode) I really do not miss the ASR’s decibels… but it is from the 90’s this feels more like one of those Fantasy Consoles nowadays. Cool! Mac and Windows. It’s a compiler too … but it can’t access things like the serial or parallel port. So it “emulates” features of the ZX Spectrum.. Does it run on Win32s ?

A set is an unordered collection of items. Every set element is unique (no duplicates) and must be immutable (cannot be changed). a set itself is mutable. We can add or remove items from it. Sets can also be used to perform mathematical set operations like union A set is created by placing all the items (elements) inside curly braces or by using the built-in It can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer string etc.). But a set cannot have mutable elements like # Different types of sets in Python
# set of integers
my_set = {1 3}
print(my_set)

# set of mixed datatypes
my_set = {1.0 Try the following examples as well. # set cannot have duplicates
# Output: {1 2}
print(my_set)

# we can make set from a list
# Output: {1 2])

On the other hand function will raise an error in such a condition (if element is not present in the set). The following example will illustrate this. # Difference between discard() and remove()

print(my_set) Sets can be used to carry out mathematical set operations like union difference and symmetric difference. We can do this with operators or methods. Let us consider the following two sets for the following operations. is a set of all elements from both sets. operator. Same can be accomplished using the # Set union method
# initialize A and B
A = {1 8}

# use | operator
# Output: {1 Try the following examples on Python shell. 8}

# use union function on B

{1 is a set of elements that are common in both the sets. operator. Same can be accomplished using the # Intersection of sets
# initialize A and B
A = {1 8}

# use & operator
# Output: {4 Try the following examples on Python shell. # use intersection function on A
>>> A.intersection(B)
{4 5}

# use intersection function on B

{1 some of which we have already used above. Here is a list of all the methods that are available with the set objects: Adds an element to the set Removes all elements from the set Returns a copy of the set Returns the difference of two or more sets as a new set Removes all elements of another set from this set Removes an element from the set if it is a member. (Do nothing if the element is not in set) Returns the intersection of two sets as a new set Updates the set with the intersection of itself and another if two sets have a null intersection if another set contains this set if this set contains another set Removes and returns an arbitrary set element. Raises Removes an element from the set. If the element is not a member Returns the symmetric difference of two sets as a new set Updates a set with the symmetric difference of itself and another Returns the union of sets in a new set Updates the set with the union of itself and others We can test if an item exists in a set or not # in keyword in a set
# initialize my_set
my_set = set(""apple"")

# check if 'a' is present
# Output: True
print('a' in my_set)

# check if 'p' is present
# Output: False
print('p' not in my_set) We can iterate through each item in a set using a >>> for letter in set(""apple""):
...     print(letter)
...    
a
p
e
l etc. are commonly used with sets to perform different tasks. if all elements of the set are true (or if the set is empty). if any element of the set is true. If the set is empty Returns an enumerate object. It contains the index and value for all the items of the set as a pair. Returns the length (the number of items) in the set. Returns the largest item in the set. Returns the smallest item in the set. Returns a new sorted list from elements in the set(does not sort the set itself). Returns the sum of all elements in the set. Frozenset is a new class that has the characteristics of a set but its elements cannot be changed once assigned. While tuples are immutable lists so they can't be used as dictionary keys. On the other hand frozensets are hashable and can be used as keys to a dictionary. Frozensets can be created using the This data type supports methods like it does not have methods that add or remove elements. # Frozensets
